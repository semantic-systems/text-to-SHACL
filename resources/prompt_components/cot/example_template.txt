TEXT:
{text}

SOLUTION:
Step 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:
    - Benefit name (German and English)
    - IDLB identifier
    - Eligibility requirements (in English)

{structured_text}

Step 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: 
    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include
    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include
    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude

Step 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:
