  * You and the person with a disability you are accompanying have statutory health insurance. 
  * The person accompanying you is being treated as an inpatient in hospital.
  * The inpatient admission as an accompanying person is medically necessary. This means that the time you spend at the hospital together with your arrival and departure time is at least 8 hours.
  * You have a loss of earnings.
  * You are a close relative or part of the immediate family.
  * The person to be accompanied receives integration assistance benefits. You will not receive sickness benefit from the health insurance fund if you accompany the person with a disability, for example as a personal assistant and receive payment for this. If you accompany the person with a disability as part of integration assistance, the costs will be covered by the integration assistance provider.
