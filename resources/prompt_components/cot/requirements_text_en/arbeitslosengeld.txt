You are entitled to unemployment benefit if

  * You are unemployed, i.e,
    * you are not in employment or
    * you are only in gainful employment for less than 15 hours per week and
    * you are available for the placement efforts of the employment agency. You are therefore able and willing to take up employment subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions;
  * you have registered as unemployed 
    * electronically with an electronic proof of identity, e.g. identity card with online ID function, in the eServices portal of the Federal Employment Agency or
    * in person at the relevant employment agency. When you register as unemployed in person, you are deemed to have applied for unemployment benefit. You must also complete an application form;
  * you have been subject to compulsory insurance for at least 12 months within the last 30 months before registering as unemployed (the so-called qualifying period). 
    * Periods in which you were subject to compulsory insurance for employment promotion due to the receipt of income replacement benefits, such as sickness benefit, or - under further conditions - due to the care of a relative or the upbringing of a child, for example, are also taken into account.
    * Periods in which you were subject to compulsory insurance requiring application (so-called voluntary continued insurance) can also be taken into account as periods of insurance, for example because you took up self-employment.
    * In special cases, periods in which you performed development service in accordance with the Development Workers Act or worked abroad on the basis of a secondment contract are also taken into account.
