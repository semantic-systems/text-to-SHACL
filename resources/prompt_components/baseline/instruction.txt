Your task is to generate a validation graph using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) based on a natural language description of eligibility requirements for a social benefit. The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

You will receive:
    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.
    - Text: A plain text description of a social benefit, including its name, ID, and eligibility criteria.

Strictly comply to the following instructions:
    1. Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.
    2. Use only SHACL Core constraint components. 
    3. Only define SHACL constraints if the relevant terms are mentioned in the ontology. Ignore criteria that cannot be expressed using ontology terms.
    4. Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax. Enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```
