Your task is to complete the SHACL shapes graph below from texts describing the eligibility requirements for social benefits. These shapes will be used to validate RDF user graphs containing personal information, ensuring that only individuals eligible for the given benefit conform to the shapes graph.

You will receive:
    - Context: An ontology containing the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user graphs.
    - Examples: An example that you can use to understand how to generate a SHACL shapes graph from an input.
    - Input: A text describing the social benefit (name, id) and eligibility criteria (requirements).

Define constraints with the terms from the provided ontology to ensure that the generated shapes graphs are relevant to the user data. If an eligibility criterion cannot be expressed with the terms from the ontology, do not include it in the shapes graph.

Strictly comply to the following output format:
    - Serialize the SHACL shapes graph in Turtle.
    - Enclose the Turtle content in a block starting with ```turtle and ending with ```.
    - Generate only the Turtle content â€” no explanations or extra text.
    - Strictly adhere to the SHACL syntax rules, using only SHACL Core constraint components.
    - Copy-paste the beginning of the Turtle file that is already provided, then use the requirements text and ontology to complete it.
