The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and wrap it in triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente' benefit with IDLB B100019_LB_582435. The user provided the description of the eligibility criteria, and I need to translate that into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the requirements from the given text. The benefit is for orphans (children, step-children, foster children, grandchildren, or siblings) of a person who died due to an insured event (work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease). The user must meet specific conditions related to their relationship to the deceased, their age, and their current status (like being in education, having a disability preventing self-support, or in a transitional period).\n\nBreaking down the eligibility criteria:\n\n1. **Death Due to Insured Event**: The deceased must have died from a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. This is similar to the previous example where the causeOfDeath must link to an event of those classes.\n\n2. **Relationship to Deceased**:\n   - Biological child (hasChild relationship from deceased)\n   - Stepchild or foster child (stepChildTo or fosterChildTo from deceased) AND lived in the same household and were cared for there.\n   - Grandchild or sibling part (need to check if they lived in the same household and were cared for).\n   - Alternatively, the deceased was the main contributor to their living expenses (hasPrimaryCareTaker linked to deceased).\n\n3. **Age Conditions**:\n   - If between 18 and under 27, they must meet one of:\n     a. In school or vocational training.\n     b. Unable to support themselves due to disability.\n     c. In a transitional period (isInTransitionalPeriod is true) of up to 4 months between education, military service, or voluntary service.\n\nAdditionally, the user must be the one applying, so the shape must target ff:User.\n\nNow, I need to map these into SHACL shapes and constraints. Let's start with the main shape targeting ff:User and then break down each requirement.\n\nStarting with the death event:\n\nThe deceased person (who is the parent, step-parent, etc.) must have a causeOfDeath that is an instance of one of the accident classes. So similar to the example, we can have a NodeShape for the deceased, which checks that their causeOfDeath is an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nNext, the relationship part. The user must be linked via one of the specified relationships. Since the relationships are from the user to the deceased (e.g., naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo), but the deceased is the one who died, perhaps the user must have a deceased parent via one of those relationships. Wait, actually, looking at the properties:\n\n- ff:naturalChildTo links the user to their natural parent (so the parent is the object).\n- Similarly, stepChildTo and fosterChildTo link to their respective parents.\n- For grandchildren or siblings, perhaps they need to have a parent who is a child of the deceased? Hmm, maybe the text says \"Enkel oder Geschwister\" (grandchildren or siblings). Wait, the description says \"Enkel oder Geschwisterteil\" (grandchildren or siblings part). Wait, maybe siblings are considered here if they lived in the household. So the user could be a grandchild or a sibling of the deceased? Or maybe the user is a grandchild or a sibling (of the deceased's child?) who lived in the deceased's household. This is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have been living in the deceased's household and cared for by them. But the exact relationships might require checking the ontology.\n\nAlternatively, the user must be either:\n\n- A biological child (naturalChildTo to the deceased)\n- A stepchild or foster child (stepChildTo or fosterChildTo) AND lived in the same household (sameHouseholdAs the deceased)\n- A grandchild or sibling (but how to represent that? Maybe through another relationship or through the household link)\n\nWait the text says:\n\n\"Enkel oder Geschwister\" (grandchildren or siblings) if they lived in the deceased's household and were cared for there. But the ontology might not have direct relationships for grandchildren. So perhaps the user must have lived in the same household as the deceased and been cared for (but how is that represented? The ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold but that's for CareNeeds. Maybe the user is linked via sameHouseholdAs and has some property indicating care, but the ontology might not have that. Alternatively, the user must have the deceased as their primary caregiver (hasPrimaryCareTaker)?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a relationship where they lived in the same household (sameHouseholdAs the deceased) and were cared for. But the ontology's properties might not capture that explicitly. Since the problem states not to model ambiguous requirements, perhaps we can focus on the explicit relationships available.\n\nAlternatively, the user can be considered if the deceased was their primary caregiver (hasPrimaryCareTaker links to deceased). Let me check the ontology:\n\nff:hasPrimaryCareTaker is a property from Person to Person, so if the user has ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker pointing to the deceased, that could cover cases where the deceased was the main provider. So for grandchildren or siblings, maybe that's the way to capture it.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a relationship that qualifies (either through parent, step-parent, foster, or primary caregiver). Since the text says \"Enkel oder Geschwisterteil, wenn Sie im Haushalt der verstorbenen Person gelebt haben und dort versorgt und betreut wurden\" (grandchildren or siblings if they lived in the deceased's household and were cared for there). To model this, perhaps the user must have a sameHouseholdAs link to the deceased and have the deceased as their primary caregiver (hasPrimaryCareTaker).\n\nBut given the ontology's properties, perhaps the simplest way is to have the user be connected via one of the listed relationships (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo, or hasPrimaryCareTaker) to the deceased. Since the problem requires using only the ontology terms, we can proceed with that.\n\nNext, for the age part:\n\nThe user must be between 18 and under 27, and in one of the three conditions (education, disability, or transitional period). If under 18, they automatically qualify, but if between 18-27, they need to meet one of those conditions.\n\nWait the text says: \"Unter diesen Voraussetzungen erhalten Sie die Waisenrente auch dann, wenn Sie 18 bis unter 27 Jahre alt sind: [conditions]\". So if the user is under 18, they qualify without needing those conditions. But if between 18-27, they must meet one of the three conditions.\n\nSo the SHACL must have a condition where either:\n\n(age < 18) OR ( (age >= 18 AND age <27) AND (one of the three conditions is true) )\n\nBut how to model age? The ontology has ff:hasAge as a data property with xsd:int. So we can use sh:property with sh:minInclusive and sh:maxExclusive.\n\nBut since the age is in completed years, for example, 18 years old is exactly 18, so under 18 would be hasAge <18, between 18-27 is hasAge >=18 AND hasAge <27.\n\nNow, the three conditions for 18-27:\n\na. In school or vocational training: so user has participates in a Training (School or VocationalTraining). Looking at the ontology, ff:participates links to Training. So the user must have at least one ff:participates to a Training (School or VocationalTraining).\n\nb. Unable to support themselves due to disability: The user has a disability that makes them unable to support themselves. The ontology has ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause linked to Disability. So the user must have ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause with a Disability, and perhaps that disability reduces their work prospects permanently (reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true).\n\nWait the text says \"kann wegen einer körperlichen, geistigen oder seelischen Behinderung nicht selbst für Ihren Unterhalt aufkommen\" (cannot support themselves due to disability). The ontology has ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause which points to Disability. So the presence of that property with a Disability instance would suffice. However, to ensure that the disability is the reason, but maybe just the existence of that property is enough. Alternatively, the Disability must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently set to true? The text says \"reduces a person's prospect of participating in working life permanently\" which is the definition of that property. So perhaps the Disability linked via cannotSupportThemselvesBecause must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nc. In a transitional period (isInTransitionalPeriod is true) of up to 4 months. The ontology has ff:isInTransitionalPeriod as a boolean, so that's straightforward.\n\nSo the conditions for 18-27:\n\nEither:\n\n- participates in a Training (School or VocationalTraining)\n- cannotSupportThemselvesBecause a Disability with reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true\n- isInTransitionalPeriod is true.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL needs to have a shape that checks these conditions based on age.\n\nNow structuring the SHACL:\n\nThe main shape (ff:WaisenrenteShape) will target ff:User and have all the constraints.\n\nFirst, the deceased must be linked via one of the relationships, and their death must be due to an insured event.\n\nThe user must have a relationship to the deceased (parent, step, foster, etc.) or have the deceased as their primary caregiver.\n\nLet's start with the relationships:\n\nThe user must have one of the following:\n\n- A deceased parent (naturalChildTo to the deceased)\n- A deceased step-parent (stepChildTo to the deceased)\n- A deceased foster parent (fosterChildTo to the deceased)\n- OR the deceased is their primary caregiver (hasPrimaryCareTaker = deceased)\n\nAdditionally, for grandchildren or siblings, perhaps the user is a grandchild (i.e., their parent is a child of the deceased), but that might complicate. The description says grandchildren or siblings if they lived in the deceased's household and were cared for. Since the ontology might not have explicit relationships for that, perhaps the primary caregiver approach covers it (if the deceased was their primary caregiver).\n\nAlternatively, the sameHouseholdAs and some other property, but since the ontology doesn't have a property for being cared for, perhaps we can only use the hasPrimaryCareTaker.\n\nSo, the user must have at least one of:\n\n- ff:naturalChildTo some ?deceased\n- ff:stepChildTo some ?deceased\n- ff:fosterChildTo some ?deceased\n- ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker = ?deceased\n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? Since SHACL allows using sh:or and sh:and, perhaps we can create a qualified value shape for the deceased person and ensure that the user has one of those relationships to them.\n\nWait, but the deceased is the one who died, so first we need to identify the deceased person linked via one of those relationships, then check that their death was due to an insured event.\n\nAlternatively, the shape for the deceased must have the causeOfDeath as an insured event. So the user must have a person related via one of those relationships (naturalChildTo etc.) who has a causeOfDeath (i.e., died) due to an insured event.\n\nSo, the main shape would have a path to the deceased person (through one of the relationships) and then check that person's causeOfDeath meets the criteria.\n\nLet me outline:\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one person (the deceased) who is linked via naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo, or hasPrimaryCareTaker, and that person has died due to an insured event (WorkAccident, etc.).\n\nSo:\n\nsh:or (\n    [ \n        sh:path ff:naturalChildTo ; \n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; \n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape \n    ] \n    [ \n        sh:path ff:stepChildTo ; \n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; \n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape \n    ] \n    [ \n        sh:path ff:fosterChildTo ; \n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; \n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape \n    ] \n    [ \n        sh:path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ; \n        sh:hasValue ?deceased ; \n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape \n    ] \n)\n\nWait, but for hasPrimaryCareTaker, the user must have their primary caregiver as the deceased, so the path is ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker, and the value (the deceased) must meet the deceased's conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the qualifiedValueShape would apply to the ?deceased node.\n\nThe ff:DeceasedPersonShape would require that the person is deceased (has a causeOfDeath) which is an insured event (WorkAccident etc.) and that the causeOfDeath is indeed an instance of those classes.\n\nWait, but how to check that the person is deceased? Because causeOfDeath implies that they died. So if they have a causeOfDeath, that means they died. So the presence of causeOfDeath indicates death.\n\nThus, the DeceasedPersonShape would require that they have a causeOfDeath which is an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have a relationship to them (either parent, step, foster, or primary caregiver).\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nThe main shape (ff:WaisenrenteShape) has a sh:or with each possible relationship path, each with a qualified value shape that checks the deceased's causeOfDeath.\n\nNext, the age and other conditions:\n\nThe user's age must be under 18, or between 18-27 and meet one of the three conditions.\n\nThis can be modeled with a sh:or where either:\n\n- hasAge < 18, or\n\n- (hasAge >=18 AND hasAge <27) AND (one of the three conditions is true)\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done using sh:or with two branches:\n\nFirst branch: age <18.\n\nSecond branch: age between 18 and 27 and satisfies one of the three conditions.\n\nBut SHACL doesn't allow combining ranges directly, so perhaps we need to structure it as:\n\nsh:and (\n    [sh:path ff:hasAge; sh:minInclusive 18; sh:maxExclusive 27]\n    [sh:or ( ... conditions ... )]\n)\n\nSo the overall condition for the age is either:\n\n(sh:or [\n    [sh:path ff:hasAge; sh:maxExclusive 18]\n    [sh:and ( [sh:path ff:hasAge;

sh:maxExclusive 18 ]\n\n    # Between 18-27 and meets one of the conditions\n    [\n        sh:and (\n            [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ; sh:maxExclusive 27 ] \n            [ sh:or (\n                # Condition 1: in school/vocational training\n                [ sh:path ff:participates ;

sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n        [ sh:path ff:stepChildTo ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n        [ sh:path ff:fosterChildTo ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n        [ sh:path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n    ) ;\n    # Age and conditions\n    sh:or (\n        # Under 18\n        [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ]\n        # 18-27 and conditions\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ; sh:maxExclusive 27 ]\n                [ sh:or (\n                    # In education\n                    [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:minCount 1 ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] ]\n                    # Disability condition\n                    [\n                        sh:path ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause ;\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                                sh:hasValue true\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                    # Transitional period\n                    [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ]\n                ) ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ) .\n\nThe DeceasedPersonShape would be:\n\nff:DeceasedPersonShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Must have a causeOfDeath that is an insured event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n    ] .\n\nWait, but also the causeOfDeath must be an event that caused their death, so the deceased must have a causeOfDeath. But since the existence of causeOfDeath implies death, that's covered.\n\nWait, but maybe the causeOfDeath must exist. So the qualified value shape requires that the deceased has a causeOfDeath which is an instance of one of the three classes.\n\nThis should handle the main requirements.\n\nNow, checking if all requirements are covered:\n\n- The deceased died due to an insured event: yes, via the DeceasedPersonShape's causeOfDeath.\n\n- The user is related via one of the relationships (natural, step, foster, or primary caregiver): yes, via the four paths.\n\n- Age conditions and other requirements for 18-27: yes, in the second part of the sh:or.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. The primary caregiver condition: does the hasPrimaryCareTaker correctly capture the scenario where the user is a grandchild or sibling living in the deceased's household? The problem states that if they lived there and were cared for, but the ontology might not have that explicitly except via hasPrimaryCareTaker. Since the user's hasPrimaryCareTaker is the deceased, that implies the deceased was their main caregiver, which should suffice.\n\n2. The vocational training condition requires participation in School or VocationalTraining. The ontology's ff:Training subclasses include School and VocationalTraining, so using sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] should work.\n\n3. The disability condition requires that the disability reduces work prospects permanently. The ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is a boolean on Disability, so checking that it's true is correct.\n\n4. The transitional period is a boolean on the user (ff:isInTransitionalPeriod), so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the SHACL should also have the metadata for the SocialBenefit individual.\n\nAdding that:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582435 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance orphan's pension\"@en .\n\nPutting all together, the final SHACL should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582435 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance orphan's pension\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:WaisenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    #死者关系验证\n    sh:or (\n        # 生物学父母\n        [ sh:path ff:naturalChildTo ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n        # 步行父母或养父母\n        [ sh:path ff:stepChildTo ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n        [ sh:path ff:fosterChildTo ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n        # 主要经济支持者\n        [ sh:path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPersonShape ]\n    ) ;\n    # 年龄和条件验证\n    sh:or (\n        # 未满18岁自动符合条件\n        [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ]\n        # 18-27岁且满足条件\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                # 年龄范围\n                [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ; sh:maxExclusive 27 ]\n                # 至少满足一个条件\n                [ sh:or (\n                    # 在校或职业教育\n                    [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:minCount 1 ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] ]\n                    # 残疾导致无法自立\n                    [\n                        sh:path ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause ;\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                                sh:hasValue true\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                    # 处于过渡期\n                    [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ]\n                ) ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ) .\n\n# 验证死者原因的形状\nff:DeceasedPersonShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # 确保死亡原因属于法定保险事故\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Einstiegsgeld' with the IDLB B100019_LB_102713860 based on the given requirements. Let me go through the requirements step by step and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, the user must have been receiving citizen benefit (Bürgergeld) before starting their new activity. The ontology has an individual for Bürgergeld: ff:B100019_LB_106311931. So the User must have a ff:receivesBenefit link to that. But wait, the requirement says \"vor Aufnahme der neuen Tätigkeit\" which implies that they were receiving it before starting the new job. However, SHACL can't track temporal conditions directly, so maybe we just check that they currently receive it? Or maybe the data includes a past benefit? The ontology has ff:receivedBenefit for past benefits. Hmm, the example used ff:receivesBenefit for a similar case. The problem states that the requirement is that they received it before starting the new activity, but since the SHACL is for validation at the time of application, perhaps the current receipt is sufficient? Or maybe it's required that they have received it prior, so we might need to use receivedBenefit. Let me check the ontology again. The ff:receivedBenefit links to a SocialBenefit the person has received in the past. Since the requirement says \"vor Aufnahme\" (before starting the new activity), the user must have received Bürgergeld before starting, which would be a past benefit. Therefore, the User should have a ff:receivedBenefit link to ff:B100019_LB_106311931. Wait, but the example used 'receivesBenefit' for a similar requirement. The example's requirement was \"Sie erhalten vor Aufnahme...\" which translates to \"You receive citizen benefit before starting the new activity.\" The example used sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 with ff:receivesBenefit. Maybe the system assumes that the citizen benefit is still being received at the time of application. Since the exact temporal aspect might not be modelable without more data, perhaps the example's approach is acceptable, so I'll follow that here.\n\nSecond requirement: The user must submit the application before starting the new activity. But SHACL can't check submission timing, so this is probably out of scope. The problem says to ignore requirements that can't be assessed, so we skip this.\n\nThird requirement: The new self-employment or employment must be suitable to overcome their need for assistance. The ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause pointing to a Disability, but not sure how to model \"suitable to overcome help need\". Maybe if the user has a workforceIntegrationProblemBecause a Disability, and the new job addresses that? Not sure. Since this is a subjective assessment by the Jobcenter, it can't be modeled via SHACL data properties. So this is ambiguous, skip as per rules.\n\nFourth: The Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration into the job market. Again, subjective, so skip.\n\nFifth: The employment must be at least 15 hours per week. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. So the user's Employment (via ff:hasEmployment) must have workHoursPerWeek ≥15. But how to structure this. The user (ff:User) has a ff:hasEmployment link to an Employment instance, which must have ff:workHoursPerWeek ≥15. So in SHACL, we can create a property shape that requires that the employment's workHoursPerWeek is ≥15. But the shape must target ff:User, so we need to traverse the hasEmployment path and then check the workHoursPerWeek. \n\nWait, the SHACL shape must target ff:User. So the property would be: sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek, and then sh:minInclusive 15. But SHACL allows for path expressions. So the shape for the User would have a property constraint on ff:hasEmployment with a nested constraint on workHoursPerWeek. Alternatively, maybe the employment is required to have that property. Let me structure this properly.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Zusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung\" (additional conditions for self-employment): \n\nPositive evaluation by the Jobcenter regarding personal suitability and economic viability. Since this is an assessment by a third party, it can't be modeled unless there's a data property indicating this. The ontology doesn't have such a property, so this is at the discretion of the Jobcenter, so we can't model this. Thus, we skip these.\n\nNow, putting it together:\n\nThe main requirements are:\n\n1. User must receive Bürgergeld (ff:receivesBenefit to ff:B100019_LB_106311931)\n2. Employment has workHoursPerWeek ≥15.\n\nWait, but the requirement says \"Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\" So the employment (or self-employment?) must be at least 15 hours/week. Since self-employment might not fit into the ff:Employment class, but the ontology has ff:SelfEmployed as an EmploymentStatus. Hmm, perhaps the EmploymentStatus must be either employed or self-employed, but the workHoursPerWeek is on Employment. Maybe the user has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Or if self-employed, maybe another property?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the user's employment status is such that their employment (if employed) has workHoursPerWeek ≥15. If self-employed, maybe there's a different property, but the ontology doesn't have that. Since the ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment, perhaps the Employment must be present and have that property. \n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\n- User must have a ff:receivesBenefit to Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931).\n\n- The User must have an Employment (via ff:hasEmployment) where the workHoursPerWeek is ≥15.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have an Employment (since the requirement is about their new activity being employment or self-employment). Wait, but self-employment might be a different EmploymentStatus. Maybe the EmploymentStatus should be either Employee or SelfEmployed, but the requirement is about hours. Let me see the ontology: ff:EmploymentStatus has individuals like Employee, SelfEmployed, etc. The ff:workHoursPerWeek is on Employment, so perhaps the Employment must exist and have workHoursPerWeek ≥15. \n\nSo the SHACL shape for the User would have:\n\n- A property constraint on ff:receivesBenefit with sh:hasValue Bürgergeld.\n\n- A property constraint on ff:hasEmployment with a nested constraint on workHoursPerWeek.\n\nWait, but the Employment is the object of hasEmployment. So the path would be:\n\nFor the workHoursPerWeek check:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n  sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n  sh:message \"The employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\"@en ;\n]\n\nBut we also need to ensure that the user has an employment. So the hasEmployment must have sh:minCount 1? Or maybe the workHoursPerWeek constraint implies that there must be at least one employment with that value. However, the employment might not exist yet if it's a new one, but the requirement is about the new activity. Hmm, the requirement says \"Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Beschäftigung\" so the user must have this new employment. Therefore, the User must have at least one Employment (ff:hasEmployment with minCount 1). But the example didn't include such a check. Wait, the example had a hasValue for receivesBenefit. Maybe the hasEmployment is required, so we need to have:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n]\n\nBut the user could have multiple employments, but the workHoursPerWeek must be at least 15 in at least one of them? Or the new one must have it. Since the data model might not track which is new, perhaps it's sufficient that there exists an employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. So combining these:\n\nFirst, ensure the user has at least one employment (maybe not necessary if the workHoursPerWeek constraint is sufficient, but better to have it explicit).\n\nSecond, the employment's workHoursPerWeek must be ≥15.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle:\n\nThe shape targets ff:User, with two properties: receivesBenefit and hasEmployment's workHoursPerWeek.\n\nWait, but the path for workHoursPerWeek is ff:hasEmployment/ff:workHoursPerWeek. So the property shape for that would be:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workHoursPerWeek ] ;  // No, that's not right. Wait, the path is ff:hasEmployment followed by ff:workHoursPerWeek. So:\n\nsh:path ff:hasEmployment/^ff:workHoursPerWeek ?\n\nNo, maybe:\n\nThe path is ff:hasEmployment (to get to the employment instances), then for each of those, check the workHoursPerWeek. So the path is ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek.\n\nWait, in SHACL, when you have a property path like a/b, it means that the objects of a are followed by the b property. So the path ff:hasEmployment/ff:workHoursPerWeek would traverse from the User to their Employment, then to the workHoursPerWeek value.\n\nTherefore, the property constraint is on that path. So the constraint would require that at least one Employment linked via hasEmployment has a workHoursPerWeek ≥15.\n\nSo the SHACL would look like:\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"Employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nAdditionally, maybe we should ensure that there is at least one hasEmployment? But if the workHoursPerWeek constraint requires that the path exists, then it's implied. Because if there are no employments, then the path would have no values, and thus not meet the minInclusive? Wait, no: the minInclusive is on the value of the path, which is a number. If there are no employments, then the path returns nothing, so the constraint would fail because there's no value to satisfy minInclusive. Therefore, the existence of at least one Employment with workHoursPerWeek is ensured by that constraint.\n\nThus, the two constraints are sufficient.\n\nWait, but the user might have multiple employments, but at least one must have ≥15. That's correct.\n\nNow, check if there are any other requirements. The first point also mentions \"Arbeitslosigkeit ist keine Voraussetzung\" (unemployment is not a requirement), which means we don't need to check unemployment status. So nothing to do there.\n\nThe additional conditions for self-employment require a positive evaluation from Jobcenter, which we can't model, so skip.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should include the two constraints as above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement: User must receive citizen benefit (Bürgergeld) before starting new activity\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Requirement: Employment must be at least 15 hours per week\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"Employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Kindergeld' (Child Benefit) with IDLB B100019_LB_576986. Let me start by reading the requirements carefully.\n\nFirst, the conditions for the parents:\n\n1. They must be fully income tax liable in Germany or taxed as such. This includes EU/EAA/CH nationals without needing a residence in Germany.\n2. For EU/EAA/CH citizens moving after August 2019, after 4 months, they must meet Freedom of Movement Act conditions. These include:\n   - Being employed (self or not) \n   - Job-seeking or involuntarily unemployed\n   - Deriving freedom from a family member\n   - Sufficient means and health insurance\n   - Permanent residence right\n3. If not from EU/EAA/CH, they must have a residence permit allowing work or be a recognized refugee/asylee.\n\nConditions for the child:\n- The child's residence must be in Germany, EU/EAA/CH, or possibly elsewhere if parents are fully taxed in Germany.\n\nLet me map these to the ontology. \n\nStarting with the parent conditions:\n\nThe parent (User) must have unlimited tax liability. The ontology has ff:incomeTaxLiability linked to TaxLiabilityScope. The individual ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability is the correct one here. So a constraint on User's incomeTaxLiability must be sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nFor EU/EAA/CH citizens moving after August 2019 (but the text says \"since August 2019\", but SHACL can't check dates unless there's a data property. Wait, the ontology doesn't have a data property for the move date. The MoveToGermany event has a date, but maybe the user's countryOfResidence is Germany, and maybe the move happened after 2019. But since the ontology doesn't track move dates, perhaps this part is ambiguous. The user might not have to model the move time if it's not in the ontology. The problem says to ignore requirements that are ambiguous or at third party discretion. So perhaps this part can't be modeled because we don't have the move date. So we can skip the part about after August 2019. \n\nThe next part for EU/EAA/CH citizens after 4 months must meet Freedom of Movement conditions. The requirements are:\n\n- Employed (self or not): So employmentStatus is either Employee or SelfEmployed. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus with possible values like Employee, SelfEmployed, JobSeeker, etc. But need to check if those are in the ontology. Looking back: yes, there are ff:Employee, ff:SelfEmployed as EmploymentStatus individuals.\n\n- Job-seeking or involuntarily unemployed: So ff:EmploymentStatus could be JobSeeker or Unemployed? Wait, the ontology has ff:JobSeeker and ff:Unemployed as EmploymentStatus. So the user must have hasEmploymentStatus in (JobSeeker, Unemployed, Employee, SelfEmployed).\n\n- Deriving freedom from a family member: The ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom property points to another person. So the user must have this property pointing to someone.\n\n- Sufficient means (ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence is true)\n\n- Adequate health insurance (ff:adequateHealthInsurance is true)\n\n- Or has permanent residence right (ff:permanentRightOfResidence is true)\n\nThese are OR conditions. So for EU/EAA/CH nationals (countryOfEmployment or countryOfNationality?), perhaps the user is a national of an EEAplusCH country. The ontology has EEAplusCH as a subclass of Country, so if ff:isNationalOf is in that class.\n\nWait, the first condition says \"Staatangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz\" which would be their nationality. So the user's ff:isNationalOf must be an instance of EEAplusCH.\n\nAlternatively, the user's countryOfResidence is Germany, but nationality could be in EEAplusCH. So the parent's nationality is in EEAplusCH.\n\nSo for the EU/EAA/CH part, the user must be a national of EEAplusCH country. Then after 4 months, they need to meet one of the conditions. But since the 4 months can't be checked, perhaps the SHACL just requires the conditions to be met, assuming that the time condition is handled elsewhere or is not part of the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a residence permit that allows work (ff:hasResidencePermit linked to a permit where entitlesToEmployment is true), but that's for non-EU people.\n\nAlternatively, the conditions for EU/EAA/CH citizens moving after 2019's 4 months part might be too ambiguous because we can't track the move time, so we can ignore it and just check the other conditions. The problem says to ignore requirements that can't be clearly assessed.\n\nSo maybe for EU citizens, the main conditions are: they have to have one of the employment statuses, or derive from a family member, have sufficient means and insurance, or permanent residence. These can be OR conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the user must satisfy at least one of those conditions. So the SHACL might have a sh:or constraint on these properties.\n\nBut let's structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, the parent must have either:\n\n- Unlimited tax liability (direct condition) OR\n\n- If they are not EU/EAA/CH nationals, they must have a residence permit allowing work (entitlesToEmployment is true) OR be a recognized refugee (hasAsylumActPermit is true or recognizedRefugee is true)\n\nWait, the third bullet for non-EU/EAA/CH: \"but have a valid residence permit that entitles to work\" (entitlesToEmployment is true on their ResidencePermit) OR \"recognized refugee/asylee\" (hasAsylumActPermit is true or entitledToAsylum is true?)\n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\n- ff:hasAsylumActPermit is a data property (xsd:boolean) on Person, so that's one.\n\n- ff:recognizedRefugee is a data property (xsd:boolean) on Person.\n\n- ff:entitledToAsylum is a data property on Person.\n\nSo for the third bullet (non-EU), user must have either:\n\n( ff:hasResidencePermit with ff:entitlesToEmployment = true ) OR ( hasAsylumActPermit = true OR recognizedRefugee = true OR entitledToAsylum = true )\n\nWait the text says \"rechtskräftig anerkannter Flüchtling oder asylberechtigt\" which is \"legally recognized refugee or entitled to asylum\". So those correspond to ff:recognizedRefugee and ff:entitledToAsylum.\n\nSo for the non-EU case:\n\nEither residence permit's entitlesToEmployment is true, OR recognizedRefugee is true OR entitledToAsylum is true.\n\nBut how to model this? The user's residence permit's entitlesToEmployment is a property of the permit, so the user must have a residence permit where ff:entitlesToEmployment is true. So in SHACL:\n\nuser hasResidencePermit [ ff:entitlesToEmployment = true ]\n\nBut since the user can have multiple permits, maybe a exists path.\n\nAlternatively, the user has a residence permit where entitlesToEmployment is true, OR they are a refugee/asylee.\n\nSo combining these conditions with OR.\n\nNow, putting this all together for the parent conditions:\n\nThe parent must satisfy:\n\nEither:\n\n- (1) Their tax liability is unlimited (ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability )\n\nOR\n\n- (2) They are a national of an EEAplusCH country AND (they meet the Freedom of Movement conditions)\n\nOR\n\n- (3) They are not EEAplusCH national and meet the non-EU conditions (residence permit entitles to work, or refugee/asylee)\n\nWait the original text says:\n\nFirst bullet: the parent must be in Germany unlimited tax liable OR taxed as such (so that's the first condition).\n\nSecond bullet is for EU/EAA/CH citizens moving after 2019, but maybe we can model the conditions without the time part.\n\nThe third bullet is for non-EU citizens.\n\nSo perhaps the parent must satisfy (tax liability is unlimited) OR (EU citizen and meets Freedom conditions) OR (non-EU and meets other conditions).\n\nBut how to structure this in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, the tax liability is the primary condition. The other conditions are for specific cases where tax liability might not be unlimited but still eligible.\n\nAlternatively, the first condition is \"you are in Germany unlimited tax liable or taxed as such\" which is the main path. The other conditions (EU citizens with certain status, non-EU with permits) are alternative paths.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe start with the main conditions.\n\nFirst, the tax liability must be unlimited, OR:\n\nThe user is a citizen of an EEAplusCH country and meets the freedom of movement conditions, OR\n\nThe user has a residence permit that allows work, or is a recognized refugee/asylee.\n\nWait the first condition includes EU citizens, but the second bullet adds more conditions for those who moved after 2019.\n\nAlternatively, the tax liability is the main requirement, but for EU/EAA/CH citizens, after 4 months, they have to meet certain criteria. Since we can't track the move date, perhaps the tax liability is the main check, and the other conditions are for those who don't have unlimited tax liability.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL must enforce the tax liability being unlimited, plus for non-German citizens, additional conditions.\n\nHmm, perhaps the SHACL needs to check:\n\nEither:\n\n- The user has unlimited tax liability (ff:incomeTaxLiability is ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability )\n\nOR\n\n- The user is a citizen of an EEAplusCH country and meets the freedom conditions (employment status, derives from family, etc.)\n\nOR\n\n- The user is a non-EEA citizen with valid residence permit for work, or refugee/asylee.\n\nBut how to model the OR conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the main shape for the user must have:\n\nEither:\n\n- (A) incomeTaxLiability is unlimited, OR\n\n- (B) ( (isNationalOf EEAplusCH) AND (employment status in allowed list OR derives freedom OR ... ) ) AND (sufficient means AND health insurance OR permanent residence )\n\nWait, this is getting too nested. Maybe break it into shapes.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have:\n\nEither:\n\n- ff:incomeTaxLiability is ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability (so a sh:hasValue constraint)\n\nOR\n\n- ( isNationalOf EEAplusCH country AND ( (hasEmploymentStatus in [Employee, SelfEmployed, JobSeeker, Unemployed] ) OR derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists ) AND (sufficientMeansOfSubsistence is true AND adequateHealthInsurance is true ) OR permanentRightOfResidence is true ) )\n\nThis is complicated. Maybe better to model each condition as a separate shape and use sh:or in the user shape's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, for the user's conditions:\n\nThe main shape will have:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability; sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ] ]\n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf; sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ]\n\n      sh:property [ sh:or ( ... conditions for EU citizens ... ) ]\n\n    ]\n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit; sh:someValuesFrom [ sh:filter ( ... ) ] ] ]\n\n    etc.\n\nBut SHACL's sh:or is for the shape's properties, so perhaps it's better to split into different shapes with disjunctive conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first condition (tax liability) is the main path, and the other conditions are alternatives when the user is not in Germany's unlimited tax.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must have incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability. That's straightforward.\n\nWait, but the text says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt.\" So either they are, or they are taxed as such. So that's a boolean condition. However, the ontology has ff:incomeTaxLiability which is linked to TaxLiabilityScope. The ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability is an individual of that class. So the user's incomeTaxLiability must be exactly ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nSo that's a mandatory property for the user.\n\nWait, but the other conditions (EU citizens, etc.) are alternative paths where the tax liability might not be unlimited. So perhaps the tax liability condition is the primary, but there are exceptions where it's not required but other conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, the tax liability being unlimited is one way to qualify, but there are other paths. So the user must satisfy at least one of the following:\n\nEither:\n\n- (A) incomeTaxLiability is unlimited\n\nOR\n\n- (B) (is EU citizen and meets freedom conditions)\n\nOR\n\n- (C) (non-EU citizen and has valid permit/refugee status)\n\nSo the user shape must have a sh:or constraint between these three conditions.\n\nBut how to model each condition.\n\nStarting with condition B (EU citizen and meets freedom conditions):\n\nThe user must be a national of EEAplusCH country (ff:isNationalOf is in EEAplusCH).\n\nThen, they must meet at least one of:\n\n- Employed (Employee or SelfEmployed)\n\n- Job seeking (JobSeeker) or involuntarily unemployed (Unemployed)\n\n- Derives freedom from a family member (ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists)\n\n- Sufficient means (ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence is true)\n\n- Adequate health insurance (ff:adequateHealthInsurance is true)\n\n- OR has permanent residence right (ff:permanentRightOfResidence is true)\n\nWait, the freedom conditions require that at least one of these is true:\n\nEither the user is employed, job-seeking, or derives from family member, OR they have sufficient means and insurance, OR permanent right.\n\nWait the original text says: \"Unionsbürgerinnen und Unionsbürger sind freizügigkeitsberechtigt, wenn sie ... (one of the options OR the other options)\".\n\nSo the user must have at least one of the first three OR the last two (sufficient means and insurance, or permanent residence).\n\nWait the text lists five conditions but says \"oder\" between them. The original German:\n\n\"selbständig oder unselbständig erwerbstätig sind\n\narbeitsuchend oder unfreiwillig arbeitslos sind\n\nihr Freizügigkeitsrecht von einem Familienangehörigen ableiten können\n\nüber ausreichende Existenzmittel und ausreichenden Krankenversicherungsschutz verfügen oder\n\nein Daueraufenthaltsrecht erworben haben.\"\n\nEach of these is an OR condition. So the user must meet at least one of the five options.\n\nWait, the user must satisfy at least one of the following:\n\n1. employed (self or not)\n\n2. job-seeking or involuntarily unemployed\n\n3. derive from family member\n\n4. sufficient means and health insurance\n\n5. permanent residence right\n\nWait the fourth option is \"sufficient means AND health insurance\", so both must be true. The fifth is alone.\n\nSo the user must have at least one of:\n\n(a) hasEmploymentStatus in [Employee, SelfEmployed]\n\n(b) hasEmploymentStatus is JobSeeker OR Unemployed\n\n(c) derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists (since the property is present, so the user must have at least one)\n\n(d) both sufficientMeansOfSubsistence and adequateHealthInsurance are true\n\n(e) permanentRightOfResidence is true\n\nSo the user must have at least one of these five conditions.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Maybe break it down.\n\nFor condition B (EU citizen):\n\nThe user must be in EEAplusCH and satisfy at least one of the five options above.\n\nSo in SHACL, this would require a shape that combines:\n\nsh:class ff:EEAplusCH on isNationalOf,\n\nAND sh:or over the five options.\n\nBut how to represent that.\n\nAlternatively, for condition B, the user must:\n\n- isNationalOf EEAplusCH,\n\nAND\n\n( (hasEmploymentStatus in [Employee, SelfEmployed] )\n\nOR (hasEmploymentStatus is JobSeeker OR Unemployed)\n\nOR (derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom has at least one value)\n\nOR (sufficientMeansOfSubsistence is true AND adequateHealthInsurance is true )\n\nOR (permanentRightOfResidence is true) )\n\nThis requires nested ORs and ANDs.\n\nThis might be challenging in SHACL with its limited components. Perhaps using sh:or and sh:xone.\n\nAlternatively, construct a shape for EU citizens that includes the necessary constraints.\n\nBut time is limited, maybe proceed step by step.\n\nNow moving to the child conditions:\n\nThe child must have residence in Germany, EU/EAA/CH, or possibly elsewhere if parents meet tax conditions.\n\nThe child's residence: their countryOfResidence is Germany or another EU/EAA/CH country.\n\nAlternatively, if the child is in another EU/EAA/CH country but parents are fully taxed in Germany, that's also okay.\n\nSo the child's countryOfResidence is in EU/EAA/CH, or Germany, or the child's parent has unlimited tax liability.\n\nWait the text says:\n\n\"Eventuell haben Sie auch dann Anspruch auf Kindergeld, wenn Ihr Kind zwar in einem Haushalt in der EU, der EWR oder der Schweiz lebt, beispielsweise Sie oder der andere Elternteil aber in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig ist oder so veranlagt wird.\"\n\nSo even if the child is in EU/EAA/CH, if the parent has unlimited tax liability in Germany, it's okay.\n\nThus, the child's residence is acceptable if either:\n\n- child's countryOfResidence is Germany or EU/EAA/CH, OR\n\n- child's countryOfResidence is elsewhere but the parent has unlimited tax liability.\n\nWait no, the second part says the child can be in EU/EAA/CH and parent in Germany, so the first condition already covers that. The second part is an example, so perhaps the main condition is:\n\nThe child's residence is in Germany or in an EU/EAA/CH country, OR the parent has unlimited tax liability in Germany (so even if child is elsewhere? Not sure.)\n\nAlternatively, the child must be in Germany, EU/EAA/CH, or the parent meets tax conditions.\n\nThis might be too vague. The main requirement is that the child's residence is in Germany or EU/EAA/CH, or if the parent is fully taxed in Germany, then even if the child is elsewhere (but the example says \"in the EU etc.\" so maybe the child must be in EU/EAA/CH if the parent is in Germany's tax).\n\nAlternatively, the child's residence must be in Germany or in an EU/EAA/CH country.\n\nSo the child's countryOfResidence must be a subclass of EEAplusCH or Germany.\n\nWait, the countryOfResidence of the child must be either Germany or any EEAplusCH country. Since EEAplusCH includes Germany? Wait the ontology says EEAplusCH is \"Member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland.\" Germany is part of EEA, so yes.\n\nThus, the child's countryOfResidence is an instance of EEAplusCH or Germany (but Germany is part of EEAplusCH). So just checking if it's an EEAplusCH country.\n\nWait, the countryOfResidence is an individual of Country, so:\n\nsh:path ff:countryOfResidence;\n\nsh:class ff:EEAplusCH .\n\nBut the child can also be in Germany, which is part of EEAplusCH.\n\nSo the child's countryOfResidence must be an EEAplusCH country.\n\nAdditionally, if the parent has unlimited tax liability, maybe the child can be elsewhere, but the text isn't clear. Since the example says \"if the child is in EU etc. and parent in Germany\", so the main condition is child in EU/EAA/CH or Germany.\n\nThus, the child's countryOfResidence is an EEAplusCH country (including Germany).\n\nNow, the SHACL for the child's shape:\n\nThe child must have countryOfResidence of EEAplusCH country.\n\nAdditionally, the parent must have unlimited tax liability OR the child's country is in EEAplusCH.\n\nWait, no. The text says \"Ihr Kind muss seinen Wohnsitz oder gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt in Deutschland oder in einem anderen EU bezieungsweise EWR-Staat oder der Schweiz haben.\"\n\nSo the child's residence is required to be in Germany or EU/EAA/CH (i.e., EEAplusCH).\n\nThus, the child's countryOfResidence must be an EEAplusCH country.\n\nSo the child's shape requires:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:countryOfResidence;\n    sh:class ff:EEAplusCH\n]\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe SHACL shape for the user must target ff:User.\n\nThe main shape will have:\n\n- For the parent's conditions:\n\nEither:\n\n1. ff:incomeTaxLiability is ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability,\n\nOR\n\n2. They are an EU citizen (isNationalOf EEAplusCH) and meet freedom conditions,\n\nOR\n\n3. Non-EU citizen with valid permit/refugee status.\n\nAdditionally, the child must be in an EEAplusCH country.\n\nSo the SHACL will have:\n\nThe main shape for User:\n\nsh:or (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability; sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ] ]\n\n    [ sh:and (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf; sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n        [ sh:or ( ... EU conditions ... ) ]\n    ) ]\n\n    [ sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit; sh:hasValue [ sh:filter ( ?p a ff:ResidencePermit ; ff:entitlesToEmployment true ) ] ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    ) ]\n)\n\nWait, perhaps breaking down each condition.\n\nAlternatively, the third condition (non-EU) requires that the user has either:\n\n- A residence permit that entitlesToEmployment is true, OR\n\n- recognizedRefugee is true, OR\n\n- entitledToAsylum is true.\n\nSo the third option in the sh:or is a shape that requires at least one of those.\n\nBut this is getting very complex. Perhaps it's better to model each condition as a separate shape and use sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, the main shape can have multiple properties with sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have:\n\nEither:\n\n- income tax is unlimited,\n\nOR\n\n( (is EU citizen and meets EU conditions) OR (non-EU conditions) )\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the SHACL structure as per the example.\n\nLooking at the example given, the example for another benefit used shapes with qualified counts and value shapes. Perhaps here we can structure similarly.\n\nFirst, the user must have income tax liability unlimited OR meet other conditions.\n\nBut let's start with the child's constraints first.\n\nThe child must be linked via ff:hasChild (assuming the parent has a hasChild relationship pointing to the child).\n\nThe user (parent) must have at least one child (since it's a benefit per child), so:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape\n]\n\nThe ChildShape enforces the countryOfResidence.\n\nNow, the parent's conditions:\n\nThe user must satisfy one of the tax/residence conditions.\n\nLet me structure the user's shape with sh:or between three conditions:\n\n1. Tax is unlimited.\n\n2. EU citizen and meets EU conditions.\n\n3. Non-EU citizen and has valid permit or refugee status.\n\nFor condition 2 (EU citizen and EU conditions):\n\nThe EU conditions are:\n\nUser has isNationalOf EEAplusCH,\n\nand (they have at least one of the five options listed earlier).\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\nsh:and (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf; sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n\n    [ sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus; sh:in (ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed) ] ]\n\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus; sh:in (ff:JobSeeker ff:Unemployed) ] ]\n\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom; sh:minCount 1 ] ]\n\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n        ) ]\n\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    ) ]\n)\n\nThis is a possible structure for condition 2.\n\nFor condition 3 (non-EU):\n\nUser must have either:\n\n- residence permit with entitlesToEmployment true,\n\nOR\n\n- recognizedRefugee true,\n\nOR\n\n- entitledToAsylum true.\n\nThis can be:\n\nsh:or (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit; sh:some ( [ sh:filter ( ?p a ff:ResidencePermit ; ff:entitlesToEmployment true ) ] ) ] ]\n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n)\n\nWait, the hasResidencePermit must point to a permit where entitlesToEmployment is true.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:hasValue with a filter.\n\nAlternatively, the user has at least one residence permit where ff:entitlesToEmployment is true. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit;\n    sh:someValuesFrom [\n        sh:filter (\n            ?p a ff:ResidencePermit &&\n            ?p ff:entitlesToEmployment true\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax for that in SHACL. Maybe using sh:hasValue with a SPARQL expression.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:property with sh:hasValue [ a ff:ResidencePermit; ff:entitlesToEmployment true ] but that might not be the right way.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a residence permit with entitlesToEmployment true. So the path ff:hasResidencePermit must have at least one value where that property holds.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment;\n        sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, this would require that every hasResidencePermit has entitlesToEmployment true, but we just need at least one. So use sh:someValuesFrom with a node shape.\n\nSo for the residence permit condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit;\n    sh:someValuesFrom [\n        a sh:NodeShape;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment;\n            sh:hasValue true\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nThis ensures that at least one of the user's residence permits has entitlesToEmployment true.\n\nPutting this together for condition 3:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n    [ sh:property [ ... residence permit condition ... ] ]\n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n)\n\nNow, the main user shape's sh:or includes:\n\n- Condition 1: tax liability is unlimited.\n\n- Condition 2: EU citizen and EU conditions.\n\n- Condition 3: non-EU conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have at least one child who meets the country condition.\n\nNow, putting all this into Turtle.\n\nThe SHACL would look something like this:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_576986 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Kindergeld\"@de, \"Child allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main Shape\nff:ChildBenefitShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"You must have at least one child meeting the residence requirements.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        # Condition 1: Unlimited tax liability\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n            ]\n        ]\n        # Condition 2: EU citizen and EU conditions\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                # Check nationality\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n                    sh:class ff:EEAplusCH\n                ]\n                # EU conditions\n                [\n                    sh:or (\n                        # Employed\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n                            sh:in (ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed)\n                        ]\n                        # Job seeking or unemployed\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n                            sh:in (ff:JobSeeker ff:Unemployed)\n                        ]\n                        # Derives from family member\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom ;\n                            sh:minCount 1\n                        ]\n                        # Sufficient means and health insurance\n                        [\n                            sh:and (\n                                [\n                                    sh:path ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence ;\n                                    sh:hasValue true\n                                ]\n                                [\n                                    sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n                                    sh:hasValue true\n                                ]\n                            )\n                        ]\n                        # Permanent residence right\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n        # Condition 3: Non-EU conditions\n        [\n            sh:or (\n                # Residence permit allows work\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                        sh:someValuesFrom [\n                            a sh:NodeShape ;\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                                sh:hasValue true\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n                # Recognized refugee\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ;\n                        sh:hasValue true\n                    ]\n                ]\n                # Entitled to asylum\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ;\n                        sh:hasValue true\n                    ]\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ) .\n\n# Child Shape\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ;\n        sh:message \"Child must reside in Germany or an EU/EAA/CH country.\"@en\n    ] .\n\nThis covers the main requirements.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\" (B100019_LB_102799525) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe first condition states that the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance. Looking at the ontology, survivors' benefits might relate to the ff:receivesBenefit property. The user should have a relationship with a SocialBenefit that represents the survivors' benefit. But I need to check if there's an existing individual for that. Wait, the ontology includes ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an Insurance instance. However, the specific benefit might not be listed. Since the exact individual isn't provided, maybe the condition is better expressed through other properties. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have an event that entitles them to such a benefit. Let me think again.\n\nThe second condition says the user has remarried or entered a new civil partnership after being widowed. The ontology has ff:MaritalStatus with ff:Married and ff:CivilUnion. The property newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property on MaritalStatus, which is a boolean. So, the user's marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nFor the first condition, maybe the user must have a ff:hasMaritalStatus that links to a MaritalStatus instance where newUnionAfterWidowhood is true. Wait, no. The first condition is about having a claim to survivors' benefits. The ontology has ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor. But perhaps the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner. Looking at the ontology, there are ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner properties. So maybe the user must have either a deceased spouse or civil partner, which would entitle them to the survivors' benefit. But the exact requirement is to have a claim, so maybe they need to have had such a relationship and now the partner is deceased. \n\nAlternatively, the ff:hasMaritalStatus could be Widowed (ff:Widowed), but the second condition says they have remarried, so their current marital status is Married or CivilUnion, but with the newUnionAfterWidowhood flag set. \n\nWait, the second condition's requirement is that they have remarried or formed a new civil union after being widowed. So their current marital status could be Married or CivilUnion, and their marital status instance must have newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nFor the first condition: To have a claim on survivors' benefits from statutory accident insurance, perhaps the deceased partner must have had such insurance. The user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner who had the insurance. But the ontology might not have direct links for that. Alternatively, the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner, and thus the ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner property must exist. \n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that the user is a beneficiary of such a claim, so maybe they need to have a ff:receivesBenefit linked to a survivors' benefit. However, in the ontology, the specific benefit isn't listed. The example given used a hasValue with the citizen benefit. Since the exact SocialBenefit individual isn't present here, maybe we can't model that exactly. But perhaps the first condition is better represented by having a deceased spouse or civil partner. \n\nWait, the first condition says \"Sie müssen einen Anspruch auf Hinterbliebenenleistung aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung haben.\" So the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits from statutory accident insurance. The statutory accident insurance is represented by ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. To have a claim, the user must be a surviving dependent of someone who had this insurance and died due to an accident covered by it. \n\nLooking at the ontology properties: The deceased spouse or civil partner must have had an event (like a work accident) that caused their death, and the user is their spouse/civil partner. So the user must have a ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner linked to a person who had an event (WorkAccident, etc.) that caused their death (ff:causeOfDeath). \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner whose death was due to an accident covered by statutory accident insurance. So the ff:causeOfDeath of that person must be an instance of a WorkAccident or similar, which is covered by the insurance. \n\nBut in SHACL, how to model this? Since SHACL can't do complex joins, maybe we can model that the user has a deceased spouse or civil partner, and their cause of death is an instance of an accident covered by the insurance. However, SHACL constraints are on the user node. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner, and that deceased person must have had an event (ff:hasEvent) which is a WorkAccident (subClassOf Event). But SHACL can't traverse that far. Since the target is ff:User, perhaps the first condition is that the user has a deceased spouse or civil partner. \n\nAlternatively, the first condition is better captured by the existence of a deceased spouse or civil partner. So in SHACL:\n\nFor the first condition:\n- The user must have either a ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. So, the user must have at least one of those properties. \n\nSo, in SHACL, that would be a constraint requiring that the user has at least one of those properties. \n\nFor the second condition:\n- The user's marital status must be Married or CivilUnion, and their marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. \n\nSo, the marital status must be one of those, and the newUnionAfterWidowhood is true. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe SHACL shape for the benefit (B100019_LB_102799525) will have two properties:\n\n1. Either deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner must exist. Using sh:or with two sh:property constraints. \n\n2. The marital status must be Married or CivilUnion, and the newUnionAfterWidowhood must be true. \n\nWait, the newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property on MaritalStatus. So the user must have a marital status that is either Married or CivilUnion, and the marital status instance must have newUnionAfterWidowhood = true. \n\nSo for the marital status constraint:\n\n- The user must have a hasMaritalStatus that is either Married or CivilUnion (so sh:hasValue with those individuals), but also the MaritalStatus instance must have newUnionAfterWidowhood true. \n\nBut in SHACL, you can't combine hasValue and a constraint on the value's properties. Alternatively, perhaps the user's marital status must be a MaritalStatus instance where newUnionAfterWidowhood is true. \n\nSo:\n\nThe user's hasMaritalStatus must be a node that is a MaritalStatus (either Married or CivilUnion) and has newUnionAfterWidowhood true. \n\nTo model this, perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:MaritalStatus ; \n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValuesDatatype ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n] \n\nWait, maybe using sh:hasValue for the newUnionAfterWidowhood. But the path would be ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood. So perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasMaritalStatus ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:class [ sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ] ;\n] \n\nHmm, this might be getting too complex. Alternatively, since the user's marital status must be Married or CivilUnion, and the newUnionAfterWidowhood is true, perhaps:\n\nThe user's hasMaritalStatus must be an instance of either Married or CivilUnion (so sh:hasValue with those) and also have newUnionAfterWidowhood true. But SHACL can't combine hasValue and another constraint on the same path. \n\nAlternatively, split into two constraints:\n\n- The marital status must be Married or CivilUnion (using sh:hasValue with those individuals)\n\n- The marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood true (so the path is ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood, with sh:hasValue true)\n\nWait, but the path for the second would be ff:hasMaritalStatus's object, then the newUnionAfterWidowhood. So:\n\nFirst constraint for marital status type:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion ;\n]\n\nSecond constraint for the newUnionAfterWidowhood:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath [ sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ] ] ;  // Not sure\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n]\n\nYes, that's better. The path is ff:hasMaritalStatus followed by the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood. So the user must have a hasMaritalStatus that has that property set to true.\n\nSo the second condition's constraints would be:\n\n- hasMaritalStatus must be either Married or CivilUnion (so the object must be one of those instances)\n\nAND \n\n- the hasMaritalStatus must have newUnionAfterWidowhood = true.\n\nWait, but if the marital status instance is Married or CivilUnion, then the newUnionAfterWidowhood is a property on that instance. So combining both:\n\nThe path for the marital status must be to an instance of either Married or CivilUnion, and that instance must have newUnionAfterWidowhood true.\n\nAlternatively, split into two properties:\n\nFirst, check that the marital status is either Married or CivilUnion:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion ;\n]\n\nSecond, check that the newUnionAfterWidowhood is true on the marital status:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n]\n\nThat way, both conditions are met: the marital status is one of those, and the flag is set.\n\nNow, the first condition: must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\n\nThe user must have at least one of the properties ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. \n\nIn SHACL, this can be done using sh:or:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n]\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n] , [\n    sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n], with sh:or between them? Wait, SHACL allows using sh:or on the property constraints.\n\nWait, the correct approach is to use sh:or on the two paths. The SHACL shape would have a property that requires either one or the other. \n\nThe syntax for that would be using sh:or with two sh:property components.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:or ( \n    [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ] \n    [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n)\n\nPutting it all together, the shape would look like this:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de .\n\nff:GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1: deceased spouse or civil partner\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 2: marital status is Married/CivilUnion and newUnionAfterWidowhood is true\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Marital status must indicate new union after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Ensure marital status is Married or CivilUnion\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion ;\n        sh:message \"Must be married or in a civil union.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in the second condition, the user must have entered a new union after widowhood. So the marital status instance (whether Married or CivilUnion) must have newUnionAfterWidowhood true. The path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ensures that the value is true. However, this doesn't enforce that the marital status is either Married or CivilUnion. \n\nTo combine both, perhaps the first property ensures that the marital status is one of those, and the second ensures the flag is true. That's why I added the separate property for the hasMaritalStatus's hasValue.\n\nAlternatively, can we combine them into a single constraint using sh:qualifiedMinCount?\n\nLike:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ] ;\n    ] ;\n] \n\nThis way, the marital status must be either Married or CivilUnion, and have newUnionAfterWidowhood true. That would be better. \n\nLet me adjust that:\n\nThe second condition's constraint can be a single property with qualified values:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Must be married or in civil union after previous widowhood.\"@en ;\n] .\n\nThis is more concise and combines both aspects of the marital status requirement.\n\nSo the full SHACL shape would be:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de .\n\nff:GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1: deceased spouse or civil partner\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 2: marital status check\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Marital status must be married/civil union with new union after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nThis should cover both conditions.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' with IDLB B100019_LB_582422 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nFirst requirement: The user must have had a work accident, commuting accident, or an occupational disease. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant classes are WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, and OccupationalDisease, all sub-classes of Event. The property to link a person to an event is ff:hasEvent. So, I need a property shape that checks that the user has an event of one of these types. \n\nSecond requirement: The user is participating in a qualified measure for participation in working life (occupational rehabilitation). \n\nThe ontology has ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, which is a class. The user must be participating in this. The property 'participates' links a person to a training or program. Wait, looking at the ontology, 'participates' has domain Person and range Training. But OccupationalRehabilitation is a separate class. Hmm, maybe the participation is in a training that is part of occupational rehabilitation? Or maybe the property should be connected to OccupationalRehabilitation directly. Alternatively, maybe the user's participation in a program that is an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the participation is in a Training that is related to occupational rehabilitation. Let me check the ontology again. The ff:participates property's range is ff:Training. The OccupationalRehabilitation class is there, but not directly connected. Maybe the requirement is that the user is participating in a training that is part of an occupational rehabilitation. Alternatively, maybe the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via some property. Wait, the ontology has an object property ff:resultsInTreatment which links an event to OccupationalRehabilitation. But maybe the user must be participating in a training that is part of their rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a different property. Looking at the ontology, the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider links a person to a RehabilitationProvider. But the key is that they are participating in a measure (training) for occupational rehabilitation. \n\nWait the requirement says \"nehmen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben teil (berufliche Reha)\". The term \"berufliche Reha\" is exactly the label for ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. So perhaps the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via some property. \n\nLooking for properties in the ontology that connect a person to OccupationalRehabilitation. The ff:triggeringEvent property has domain EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the participation in a training that is part of occupational rehabilitation. Since ff:participates links to Training, and the requirement specifies \"qualified measure\" which is part of occupational rehab, maybe the training must be of a type that is considered part of OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, the user's participation in a Training that is recognized for this purpose. Let me check the ontology. There's a property ff:subjectToContract which links Training to VocationalTrainingContract. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a property. Wait, there's the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, but that links to the provider, not the rehabilitation itself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has an event (the accident) that results in an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. Looking at ff:resultsInTreatment, which is an object property from Event to OccupationalRehabilitation. So if the event (accident) results in treatment (rehabilitation), then the user must have that. \n\nSo, perhaps the second requirement is that the user is participating in the occupational rehabilitation resulting from their accident. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the participation in the rehabilitation is via the ff:participates property, but the training must be of type OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nWait, in the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, but not a subclass of Training. So perhaps the user's participation in a Training that is linked to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via some property. Let's see: \n\nLooking at all properties in the ontology. The ff:triggeringEvent has domain EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. Not helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe the user must be participating in a training that is part of their rehabilitation. Since the requirement says \"teilen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" (participate in a qualified measure for participation in working life), and the note in the example shows using ff:participates. So perhaps the user's participation in a Training that is an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation? But the ontology shows that ff:Training is a separate class, and ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a separate class. Wait, maybe the training is part of the occupational rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a different property. Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps the user must have an OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via the ff:resultsInTreatment from their event. For example, the event (accident) results in treatment (rehabilitation). So the user's event (the accident) must have a ff:resultsInTreatment link to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance, and the user is participating in that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the participation is directly in an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. But since ff:participates has range Training, and OccupationalRehabilitation is not a subclass of Training, that might not work. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to model this differently. The second condition says \"taking part in a qualified measure for participation in working life (occupational rehabilitation)\". Since the user must be participating in such a measure, and the ontology has ff:participates linking to Training, maybe the Training must be of a type that is part of occupational rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a disability, but that might not be necessary here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the user is participating in a training (via ff:participates) which is related to occupational rehabilitation, but I need to ensure that the training is of a certain type. Since the ontology doesn't have a subclass of Training for this, maybe we can use the label of the SocialBenefit to indicate it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second requirement can be modeled as the user has a participation in a Training that is of type OccupationalRehabilitation. Wait, but in the ontology, OccupationalRehabilitation is a class not a subclass of Training. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation, but how to link it. \n\nWait, looking at the ontology again: \n\nThere is an object property ff:resultsInTreatment which has domain ff:Event and range ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. So the event (the accident) must result in an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. \n\nAdditionally, the user must be participating in that rehabilitation. But how to model participation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a participation in a training that is part of the occupational rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the participation is modeled as the user has a ff:participates link to a Training which is connected to the OccupationalRehabilitation instance via some property. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, the first condition: the user has an event that is a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nIn SHACL, this would be a property shape on ff:hasEvent, with sh:class being one of those three. \n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nSecond condition: participating in a qualified measure (occupational rehabilitation). \n\nAssuming that the participation is via ff:participates and the training must be part of occupational rehabilitation. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct link, perhaps the training must have a property indicating it's part of occupational rehab. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the OccupationalRehabilitation instance is connected to the user's event via ff:resultsInTreatment, and the user must be participating in that. \n\nAlternatively, the participation in any training that is related to the event's rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked through another property. \n\nWait, the user must be participating in the rehabilitation. Since the rehabilitation is an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation, perhaps the user must have a participation in a Training that is connected via a property to the OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the training is the OccupationalRehabilitation itself, but since the range of participates is Training, and OccupationalRehabilitation is a different class, that might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a participation in a Training that is subject to some condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's participation in a training is sufficient as long as the training is for occupational rehabilitation. Since the exact property isn't clear, but in the example, the user might just need to be participating in a training (any training?), but the example's second condition says \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" which is exactly the description of OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, the user's participation is in a training that is part of the occupational rehabilitation. Since the ontology has ff:OccupationalRehabilitation as a class, perhaps the user must have an instance of that linked via a property. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a ff:participates link to a Training that is related to the event's OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Since the ontology may not have explicit properties for this, perhaps we can model it as the user has a participation in any Training (since the exact subclass isn't defined), but that might not be precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second condition is just that the user is participating in any training (since the exact type isn't specified in the ontology), but the example shows that the first condition is checked via the event's type. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second requirement is simply that the user is participating in a training (any training?), as the participation is required. But the note says \"qualified measure\" which is part of occupational rehab. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's participation in any training is sufficient, but that might not capture the requirement properly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must be participating in a training that is commissioned by the employment agency (like in the example). But the text doesn't specify that here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second condition is just that the user has a participation in any Training instance. Let me check the problem statement again: \n\n\"Sie nehmen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben teil (berufliche Reha).\" \n\nThe term in parentheses is \"berufliche Reha\" which is exactly the label for ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. So the user must be participating in a measure that is \"berufliche Reha\". \n\nIn the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class. But the user's participation is via ff:participates which links to Training. So perhaps the Training must be an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation? \n\nWait, but in the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, but not a subclass of Training. Therefore, that might not be possible. \n\nHmm. Maybe the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via another property. For example, perhaps the user has a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, but that links to the provider, not the rehabilitation itself. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's participation in a training that is connected to the OccupationalRehabilitation instance via some property. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second condition can be modeled as the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a property. \n\nWait, maybe the user must have a ff:participates link to a Training which is part of an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. But without an explicit property in the ontology for that, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second condition is simply that the user has a participation in a Training, and that's sufficient. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but since the example uses ff:participates for participation in training, and the requirement mentions \"taking part in a measure\", maybe the user must have a participation in any Training instance. So the SHACL would check for existence of ff:participates. \n\nWait, but the exact requirement is that the training is a qualified measure for occupational rehabilitation. Since the ontology doesn't have a specific subclass of Training for that, perhaps it's acceptable to just check that the user is participating in any training (since the ontology might not have that detail). Alternatively, perhaps there's a class in the ontology that represents this. \n\nLooking again at the ontology classes: \n\nThere is a ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, which is a subclass of Training. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's participation in any Training is sufficient, and the rest is covered by the first condition. \n\nAlternatively, the example might have used a similar approach. Let me check the example given. \n\nIn the example for Insolvenzgeld, the participation in training wasn't required, but here, the user must be participating in a training (or similar). \n\nWait the example shows that the user has to have an event and be employed, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second requirement is modeled by requiring that the user has a participation in a Training instance. \n\nSo, for the second condition, the SHACL would have a property shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User is participating in a qualified measure for occupational rehabilitation'.\"@en ;\n].\n\nBut this might not capture the exact requirement, but given the ontology's limitations, perhaps this is the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another property. \n\nWait, the ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause which points to a Disability. But that's not directly related here. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to the Disability caused by the accident, but that's not part of the requirements given. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must be undergoing rehabilitation, so the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a property. Since ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, perhaps the user must have a participation in a Training that is linked via a property to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. But without explicit ontology properties, this is hard. \n\nGiven the time constraints and ontology provided, perhaps the second condition is modeled as the user must have a ff:participates link to any Training instance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OccupationalRehabilitation is linked via the ff:triggeringEvent. The user's EarningCapacity might have a triggeringEvent which is the accident, leading to the rehabilitation. But this is getting too convoluted. \n\nGiven that the user must be participating in a qualified measure (training) for occupational rehab, and the only relevant property is ff:participates, I'll proceed with that. \n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape will target ff:User, check for the event type, and participation in training. \n\nSo the main shape will have two properties:\n\n1. hasEvent must be one of the three event types.\n\n2. participates must exist (i.e., user is participating in a training).\n\nAdditionally, each of these must be present, so the shape will have:\n\nsh:property for hasEvent with the class restriction,\n\nand another sh:property for participates with minCount 1.\n\nAlso, the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_582422, so the benefit individual should be defined.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle code.\n\nFirst, define the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance for occupational rehabilitation\"@en .\n\nThen the main shape:\n\nff:UnfallRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or (\n                ff:WorkAccident\n                ff:CommutingAccident\n                ff:OccupationalDisease\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has an accident or occupational disease'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User is participating in occupational rehabilitation'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nBut wait, the second condition is specifically about participating in a qualified measure (i.e., occupational rehabilitation). The ff:participates links to Training, but maybe there's a way to ensure that the training is related. \n\nAlternatively, the OccupationalRehabilitation might be linked via another property. Since the event (accident) must result in treatment (ff:resultsInTreatment), perhaps the user's event must have a ff:resultsInTreatment to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance, and the user's participation must be in that instance. \n\nBut the user's participation is in a Training, not directly in the OccupationalRehabilitation. \n\nHmm. Since the ontology doesn't explicitly link Training to OccupationalRehabilitation, perhaps it's impossible to model precisely, so we have to assume that participation in any training is sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the above code should work. \n\nWait, but in the example, they used sh:or for multiple shapes. Here, the first condition is a single path with sh:class using sh:or.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this SHACL problem step by step. The task is to create a SHACL graph for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld' (B100019_LB_102799515) based on the given conditions. First, I need to understand the requirements from the description provided.\n\nThe user must meet the following conditions to be eligible for this benefit:\n\n1. They must supervise, care for, or look after a child from their household due to the consequences of an insurance event (school or kindergarten accident).\n2. The child hasn't yet turned 12 years old.\n3. Before starting this care, the user had a claim to earnings or another monetary benefit (like sick pay or unemployment benefit).\n4. There's no other person in the household who can care for the child.\n\nFirst, I'll map these conditions to the ontology provided. Let me go through each requirement one by one.\n\nStarting with the first point: the user must be taking care of a household child due to an accident (school/kindergarten). The ontology has a property like 'ff:hasEvent' but also specific subclasses like 'ff:SchoolAccident' and 'ff:KindergartenAccident', which are types of 'ff:Event'. The user's care for the child might be linked through some object property. The 'ff:caregiverInHousehold' links a care need to a caregiver in the household, but the user is the caregiver here. Alternatively, maybe the child has a care need, and the user is the caregiver. The 'ff:needsCare' property links a person to their care needs. The care need would then have a caregiver via 'ff:caregiverInHousehold'. However, the requirement states that the user is the one doing the caring, so perhaps the user must be the caregiver in the household. So, the user should be the value of 'ff:caregiverInHousehold' of the child's care need.\n\nWait, the ontology defines 'ff:caregiverInHousehold' as an object property with domain 'ff:CareNeed' and range 'ff:Person'. So, the CareNeed node must have a caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user. So the user must be the caregiverInHousehold of a CareNeed that is linked to an accident (school or kindergarten). Also, the accident must be an instance of either SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\nSecond requirement: the child is under 12. So, the child's age must be less than 12. The ontology has 'ff:hasAge' as a data property on Person, so we can check that.\n\nThird condition: the user had a claim to earnings or another monetary benefit before starting the care. The ontology has 'ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause' but maybe that's not relevant here. The 'ff:triggeringEvent' on EarningCapacity links to an event that caused the loss. Alternatively, the user must have had an event (like losing their job) before starting the care, and that event caused their loss of earnings. The data property 'ff:causesLossOfEarnings' on Event might be relevant here. Also, the user must have had an entitlement to a cash benefit before the event, as per 'ff:wasEligibleFor' or 'ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore'.\n\nLooking at the ontology, there's a data property 'ff:wasEligibleFor' which links a person to a benefit they were eligible for in the past. But the third condition mentions having a claim to earnings or another benefit before the care started. The 'ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' property on a person links to an event before which they were entitled to a cash benefit like salary or unemployment benefit. That seems relevant. So the user must have an event (triggering the care) and that event has a 'ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' set to true? Or perhaps the user has a property that before the triggering event, they were entitled. Alternatively, the triggering event (the accident) would have caused the need for care, but the user had a previous entitlement.\n\nWait the third condition says: \"vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes hatten Sie einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung\". So before the care started, the user had a claim to earnings or another benefit. So perhaps the user has an event (the accident) which caused the need for care, and before that event, they had an entitlement to a cash benefit. The 'ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' property on the person links them to an event before which they were entitled to cash benefits. Wait, the domain is 'ff:Person' and the range is 'ff:Event'. Wait no, looking at the ontology:\n\nWait in the ontology:\n\nObjectProperty: ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore\n    Annotations: rdfs:comment \"Links a person to an event before which they were entitled to a cash benefit like salary or unemployment benefit.\"@en\n    Domain: ff:Person\n    Range: ff:Event \n\nSo the user (person) must be linked via this property to an event (the accident), indicating that before the event, they were entitled to cash benefits. So the user must have an assertion like user ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ?event, where ?event is the accident causing the need for care. Alternatively, the event in question (the accident) is the one that caused the need for care, and the user had entitlement before that event.\n\nFourth condition: no other household member can care for the child. So the user must have no other person in the same household who can provide care. The 'ff:sameHouseholdAs' links two persons in the same household. So the user must have no other person in their household (i.e., someone linked via sameHouseholdAs) who can care for the child. Alternatively, perhaps the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must only be the user, meaning there is no other caregiver. Hmm, maybe the CareNeed must have exactly one caregiverInHousehold which is the user. But that might not capture the requirement. Alternatively, the user must assert that there are no other people in the household who can care for the child. Since SHACL can't do negative existence checks easily, maybe we can structure this by requiring that the user is the only caregiverInHousehold for the CareNeed.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth condition requires that no other household member can provide the care, so perhaps the user must not have any other person in their household (via sameHouseholdAs) who is a caregiver in this case. So, for the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the only person is the user. So in SHACL, we can require that the caregiverInHousehold is the user and that there are no others. However, SHACL's NodeShape constraints can't directly enforce the absence of other caregivers. So maybe the CareNeed must have exactly one caregiver, which is the user. But how to express that? Alternatively, perhaps the requirement can be inferred by ensuring that the caregiver is the user, and that there's no other person in the household who could be a caregiver, but that's tricky. Since the ontology doesn't have a property indicating ability to care, maybe it's better to model that the user is the only caregiverInHousehold for the CareNeed. So the CareNeed must have exactly one caregiverInHousehold, which is the user. So using sh:minCount and sh:maxCount on the property.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shapes.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the user (targetNode is ff:User). The shape will have several properties:\n\n1. The user must be a caregiverInHousehold for a CareNeed that is linked to an insurance event (school/kindergarten accident).\n\n2. The child's age must be under 12.\n\n3. The user had entitlement to cash benefits before the event causing the care.\n\n4. There is no other caregiver in the household.\n\nBreaking down each part:\n\n1. The first condition involves linking the user's role as caregiver. Let's consider that there is a CareNeed node associated with the child. The CareNeed must be caused by an insurance event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident). The CareNeed is linked to the user via caregiverInHousehold.\n\nSo, in SHACL, the user must have a path that goes through the child's CareNeed. But how is the CareNeed connected? The child (a person) must have a care need via ff:needsCare, and that CareNeed has a caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user. The CareNeed must also have a cause (the accident).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed itself is linked to an event via some property? The ontology defines CareNeed as a subclass of Event. Wait, looking back: CareNeed is a subclass of Event? Wait, no, in the ontology:\n\nWait, the ontology says:\n\nClass: ff:CareNeed\n    SubClassOf: ff:Event \n\nAh yes, CareNeed is a type of Event. Wait that's interesting. So a CareNeed is an event. So the CareNeed itself is an event, which is caused by another event (the accident)? Or perhaps the CareNeed is the consequence of the accident. Alternatively, the CareNeed is the event that requires care due to an accident. Hmm, this might complicate things, but perhaps the CareNeed has a trigger or cause. Alternatively, the CareNeed's occurrence is linked to an accident event via some property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accident (school/kindergarten) is the event that caused the CareNeed. The CareNeed as an event would then be linked to the accident. But I need to see how to express that in SHACL. Let me think: the CareNeed must be linked via some property to an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. Alternatively, the CareNeed's cause is the accident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed's 'triggeringEvent' (since CareNeed is an Event, maybe it has a 'triggeringEvent' but looking at the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology's object properties, there's ff:triggeringEvent which has domain ff:EarningCapacity and ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. So that's not applicable here. Maybe the CareNeed's cause is the accident, so the CareNeed's 'cause' is the accident. But looking at the ontology, the 'ff:causeOfDeath' is an object property from Person to Event, but that's specific to death. There's no general cause property for events. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's occurrence is due to an accident (School or Kindergarten). Since the CareNeed is an Event, maybe the accident is part of its description. Since SHACL can't enforce class membership of a node unless it's explicitly stated, perhaps the CareNeed node must be linked via a property to an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. Alternatively, the CareNeed itself is the consequence of such an accident, but without a direct property, this might be challenging. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed must have a type that is a consequence of an accident. Since CareNeed is an Event, perhaps the CareNeed is a subclass of such accidents? No, the ontology shows CareNeed is a subclass of Event but not directly linked to accidents. Maybe the CareNeed is linked to the accident via a property like 'ff:triggeringEvent', but that's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the accident is the cause, but the ontology lacks such a property. Hmm, this is a problem. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct way to link the CareNeed to the accident's type, maybe the only way is to require that the CareNeed is an instance of a subclass that represents the consequence of an accident. But I don't see such subclasses. Alternatively, perhaps the accident is the 'triggeringEvent' for the CareNeed? Since CareNeed is an Event, maybe the triggering event would be the accident. But in the ontology, 'triggeringEvent' is only for EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. So perhaps this is a missing property in the ontology? Since the user can't invent terms outside the ontology, I must work with existing properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the CareNeed is the consequence of an accident, but there's no explicit property. Since the CareNeed is an Event, maybe it's necessary to ensure that the CareNeed's triggeringEvent is an accident of the correct type. But since the ontology doesn't have that property, perhaps this condition can't be modeled? That's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the CareNeed is linked via 'ff:hasEvent' but that's not applicable here. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed must be linked via some other means. Let me think again. The first condition says the user must care for the child due to consequences of an insurance event (school or kindergarten accident). The insurance event must be a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. The CareNeed would be the consequence of that accident. Since the CareNeed is an Event, perhaps the accident is the cause of the CareNeed. Since there's no explicit property for cause in events, maybe this can't be directly expressed. The user might have to assume that the CareNeed is directly the accident, but that's not the case because the accident is the cause. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed's occurrence is directly tied to the accident, so the CareNeed must be an instance of a subclass that represents such a consequence. Since the ontology doesn't have such a subclass, this might not be possible. This is a potential ambiguity. However, the problem states to not model requirements that are ambiguous or at discretion of third parties. Since this might be ambiguous, maybe we have to model as much as possible and leave out parts that can't be expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the accident is linked to the child via some property. The child has an accident (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident), and the CareNeed is the care required because of that accident. But how to link them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed is linked to the child's accident via a property. Let me check the ontology again. The 'ff:hasEvent' is an object property with domain Person and Employer, range Event. So a person can have an event (like an accident) via 'hasEvent'. So the child would have the accident (School or Kindergarten) via 'hasEvent', and the CareNeed is the result. But the CareNeed must be the consequence of that event. However, in SHACL, without a direct link between the CareNeed and the accident, this is tricky. \n\nMaybe the user must have a child who has an accident (School or Kindergarten), and the CareNeed is associated with that child's accident. So the user's CareNeed is linked to the child's accident. But how to structure that in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a child who has a School/Kindergarten accident, and the user is the caregiver for that child's care needs caused by the accident. \n\nPerhaps the approach is:\n\n- The user must have a child (via ff:hasChild).\n\n- The child has an accident (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) via 'hasEvent'.\n\n- The child has a CareNeed (an instance of CareNeed), which is linked to the user as caregiver.\n\nWait, but the CareNeed is an Event (subclass of Event), so the child might 'hasEvent' the CareNeed, which is the consequence of the accident. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to proceed with the parts that can be modeled and note that the accident type might be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CareNeed itself is an instance of a subclass that represents care needed after such an accident. Since CareNeed is a subclass of Event, but there's no further subclass for this, perhaps this can't be done. In that case, maybe the first condition can only be partially modeled by ensuring that the user is a caregiver for the child's CareNeed, without specifying the accident type. But the problem requires the accident to be a school or kindergarten accident, so that's a key condition. If this can't be expressed, maybe it's considered ambiguous and thus omitted, but the problem says to not model ambiguous parts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accident is the 'triggeringEvent' of the CareNeed. But the ontology's triggeringEvent is only for EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. So that's not applicable here. \n\nThis is a problem because without a way to link the CareNeed to the type of accident, we can't enforce that part. Since this is required, and the ontology doesn't support it, maybe the user has to make an assumption or find another way. Wait, perhaps the CareNeed's type is determined by the accident's type. Since CareNeed is a subclass of Event, but there's no further subclass, perhaps this can't be modeled. Therefore, this part may have to be considered ambiguous, and thus we exclude it? But the problem requires it, so perhaps the user must proceed with the available properties and assume that the CareNeed is the consequence of an accident of the correct type. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed is linked to the child's accident via 'ff:causeOfDeath' but that's for death. Not applicable here. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should proceed and note that the CareNeed must be caused by a school or kindergarten accident, but since there's no explicit property, perhaps we can't model this part and thus the condition is ambiguous, so we exclude it. However, the problem says to not model requirements that are ambiguous, so this might be necessary. But the user is supposed to model as much as possible. Alternatively, perhaps the accident is the triggering event, even if not in the ontology. Wait, but we can't invent terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CareNeed is the accident itself. For example, the CareNeed is an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. But since CareNeed is a subclass of Event, and SchoolAccident and KindergartenAccident are also subclasses of Event, that's possible. So the CareNeed must be an instance of either SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. But then the CareNeed would be the accident itself, which is the event causing the need for care. That makes sense. So the CareNeed node is actually the accident event. Then the caregiverInHousehold would be the user, and the CareNeed (accident) must be of the correct subclass. \n\nWait, that could work. So the CareNeed (as a subclass of Event) can be an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. Therefore, the CareNeed node must be a type of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. Thus, in SHACL, we can require that the CareNeed is of those types.\n\nSo the user must have a child for whom there is a CareNeed (i.e., an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) and the user is the caregiverInHousehold for that CareNeed.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- The user has a child (ff:hasChild).\n\n- The child has a CareNeed (Event) which is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\n- The CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user.\n\nAdditionally, the CareNeed (accident) must be linked to the child somehow. Since the CareNeed is an Event, perhaps the child has the event via 'hasEvent'?\n\nSo the child must have an event (the CareNeed/accident) via 'hasEvent', and that event is of the correct type.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would require:\n\nFor each child (ff:hasChild), there exists an event (CareNeed) that is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, which the child has via 'hasEvent', and the user is the caregiverInHousehold of that CareNeed.\n\nThis way, the conditions are met.\n\nNow, moving to the SHACL structure:\n\nThe user must have a child (ff:hasChild) who has an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) via 'hasEvent', and that event (CareNeed) has caregiverInHousehold as the user.\n\nAdditionally, the child's age must be under 12.\n\nThird condition: The user had entitlement to cash benefits before the event (accident). The user must have a 'wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' linked to the accident event. Because the accident is the event that caused the need for care, the user must have been entitled to cash benefits before that event.\n\nFourth condition: no other household member can care for the child. So the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user, no others. So the CareNeed must have exactly one caregiverInHousehold, which is the user.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFirst, create a shape for the user targeting ff:User.\n\nThe user must have at least one child (ff:hasChild). For each child:\n\n- The child has an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) via 'hasEvent' (i.e., child's 'hasEvent' points to an accident).\n\n- The child's age must be less than 12 (ff:hasAge < 12).\n\n- The accident (event) must be linked to the user via caregiverInHousehold of its CareNeed (Wait, no, the CareNeed is the accident itself here. Wait, the CareNeed is the accident, which is an instance of SchoolAccident. The caregiverInHousehold is the user. So the CareNeed (accident) must have a caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user.\n\nWait, the CareNeed is the event (the accident), so the CareNeed (as the accident) must have a caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user.\n\nSo for the CareNeed (accident), the caregiverInHousehold is the user. So the user is the caregiverInHousehold of the accident (which is the CareNeed event).\n\nAdditionally, the accident must be the child's event (child hasEvent accident).\n\nTherefore, the user must have a child who has an event (School/Kindergarten accident) and the user is the caregiver for that event's care need.\n\nBut the CareNeed (accident) must also be the one that requires care.\n\nSo in SHACL terms, for the user's child:\n\nThe child hasEvent ?accident (a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident).\n\nThe accident (as CareNeed) has caregiverInHousehold the user.\n\nAlso, the accident must be a CareNeed? Wait, SchoolAccident and KindergartenAccident are subclasses of Event. CareNeed is also a subclass of Event. But in this case, the accident is the CareNeed? Or is the CareNeed a separate event caused by the accident? This is unclear. The problem states that the user is caring for the child due to consequences of the accident. So the CareNeed is the consequence, but the accident is the cause. Without a property linking them, perhaps the CareNeed is the accident itself. Hence, the accident is both the event causing the need and the CareNeed.\n\nTherefore, the CareNeed is the accident (School/KindergartenAccident), so the CareNeed is an instance of those classes.\n\nThus, the user must be the caregiverInHousehold of the CareNeed (accident), and the child has that accident as an event.\n\nSo the SHACL for the child's shape would include:\n\n- hasEvent ?accident (SchoolAccident/KindergartenAccident).\n\n- The accident (CareNeed) has caregiverInHousehold as the user.\n\n- The child's age is <12.\n\nThe user's shape must have:\n\n- At least one child meeting these conditions.\n\n- The user had entitlement to cash benefits before the accident event (the accident is the event in wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore).\n\n- No other caregivers in the household for the CareNeed (accident). So the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user, so the count is exactly 1 and it's the user.\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nMain shape for user:\n\nff:KinderverletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n    ] ;\n    # User must have been entitled to cash benefit before the accident event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:EventShape ; # ensure the event is the CareNeed (accident)\n    ] ;\n    # No other caregivers in the household for the CareNeed (accident)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasChild ff:hasEvent ff:caregiverInHousehold) ; # path to caregivers of the child's accident\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMaxCount 1 ; # only the user can be caregiver\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User ; # must be the user\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nBut this might be too convoluted. Maybe using nested shapes.\n\nAlternatively, the ChildShape would include the accident and caregiver conditions.\n\nThe ChildShape would require:\n\n- hasEvent ?accident (School/KindergartenAccident)\n\n- The accident (as CareNeed) has caregiverInHousehold as the user.\n\n- The child's age <12.\n\nThe user's shape would then check for at least one child with these conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have 'wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' linked to the accident event.\n\nSo, the user's 'wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' must point to the same accident event that the child has.\n\nThus, in SHACL, we need to ensure that the event linked via wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore is the same as the child's accident event.\n\nThis requires a path equality, which in SHACL can be done using sh:equals or sh:link. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:sparql for this condition might be necessary, but since the problem specifies to use only SHACL Core, which doesn't include SPARQL, we have to use Core constraints.\n\nPerhaps structuring it as:\n\nThe user has a child where the child has an event (accident) of the right type, and the user's wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore points to that same accident.\n\nThis would require that the accident event is both the child's event and the user's wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore's object.\n\nTo express that in SHACL Core is tricky. Maybe by requiring that the user's wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore has a property linking to the child's accident. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to ensure that the user has a wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore linked to an event which is of the type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, but that might not enforce it's the same as the child's accident.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try to structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the user:\n\n- Must have at least one child that meets the child conditions.\n\n- Must have a wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore linked to the accident (which is the child's event).\n\n- The CareNeed (accident) must have exactly the user as caregiverInHousehold.\n\nBut how to tie these together without SPARQL?\n\nMaybe:\n\nThe user's shape includes:\n\n1. A property shape for ff:hasChild with a qualified value shape that includes the child's conditions.\n\nThe child's shape (ff:ChildShape):\n\n- hasAge <12.\n\n- hasEvent ?event (School/KindergartenAccident).\n\n- The event (CareNeed) has caregiverInHousehold = user.\n\n- The user's wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore must include this event.\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the child's shape can't reference the user's properties. Because the shape is applied to the child node, it can't access the user's properties.\n\nThis is a problem because the user's 'wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore' must point to the child's accident event. To enforce this, the SHACL would need a cross-referential constraint, which isn't possible in SHACL Core without SPARQL.\n\nHmm. This is a limitation. Since the user can't use SPARQL, perhaps this condition can't be enforced, so we might have to consider it ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the user just needs to have any event for wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore, but that doesn't ensure it's the same as the child's accident.\n\nThis is a problem. Since the condition requires that the entitlement existed before the accident causing the care, the event in wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore must be the same as the accident event. Without SPARQL, this can't be expressed, so perhaps this part has to be omitted, making it ambiguous. The problem says to not model ambiguous parts, so maybe this condition can't be fully modeled and thus excluded? But the third condition is essential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accident event is the same as the one causing the loss of entitlement. But I'm stuck. Maybe proceed by requiring that the user has a wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore linked to some event, and that event is the child's accident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe structure the user's shape to have a property that the wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore's event is of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. But that doesn't ensure it's the same as the child's accident.\n\nAlternatively, give up and proceed with what can be done, noting that the accident type and the entitlement event link can't be fully expressed. But the problem requires it, so perhaps the best is to proceed with the available properties and assume that the accident is linked.\n\nProceeding:\n\nThe ChildShape would have:\n\n- hasAge <12.\n\n- hasEvent ?event which is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\n- The event (CareNeed) has a caregiverInHousehold of the user.\n\nThe user's shape would require:\n\n- hasChild with ChildShape.\n\n- has a wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore linked to the same event as the child's accident. But without SPARQL, this is hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore must point to an event of the correct type (School/Kindergarten Accident). So in the user's shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type;\n            sh:in (ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident)\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nThis would ensure that the event the user refers to is the correct type, even if it's not the same as the child's accident. But this might not be sufficient, but it's the best possible without SPARQL.\n\nThe fourth condition: no other caregiver. The CareNeed (accident event) must have exactly one caregiverInHousehold, which is the user. So in the child's shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ; # the accident\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:maxCount 1 ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nThis would require that the accident event's caregiverInHousehold is exactly one, and it's the user.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nSHACL:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799515 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld\"@de, \"Child Injured Accident Insurance\"@en .\n\nff:KinderverletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n    ] ;\n    # User must have been entitled to cash benefit before the accident event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet all requirements for Kinderverletztengeld.\"@en .\n\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 12 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ; # The accident event\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Child does not meet the requirements.\"@en .\n\nWait, but the 'hasEvent' path is for the child to have the accident. The qualifiedValueShape ensures that the accident is of the right type and has caregiverInHousehold as user.\n\nThis should cover:\n\n- Child's age <12.\n\n- Child has an accident of the correct type.\n\n- The accident has caregiverInHousehold exactly the user.\n\nThe user's shape also requires that they were entitled to cash benefits before some event of those types.\n\nThis covers the third condition (they had entitlement before the event), but it doesn't ensure that the event in wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore is the same as the child's accident. But without SPARQL, this can't be enforced. So this is the best possible given the ontology's constraints.\n\nThe fourth condition (no other caregiver) is handled by requiring that the caregiverInHousehold is exactly the user.\n\nThus, this should be the SHACL.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit\nff:B100019_LB_102799515 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld\"@de, \"Child injured accident insurance\"@en .\n\n# Main shape for the user\nff:KinderverletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [ \n        # User must have at least one child meeting eligibility criteria\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ \n        # User must have been entitled to cash benefits before the accident event\n        sh:path ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [ \n            sh:property [ \n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ; \n            ] \n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet all requirements for 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld'.\"@en .\n\n# Shape for eligible child\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [ \n        # Child must be under 12 years old\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 12 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ \n        # Child must have a qualifying accident (School/Kindergarten Accident)\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [ \n            sh:property [ \n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ; \n            ] ;\n            sh:property [ \n                # Caregiver must be the user and no other caregiver exists\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ; \n                sh:hasValue ff:User ; \n            ] \n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Child does not meet the requirements for this benefit.\"@en .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' benefit. First, I need to parse the given requirements and map them to the ontology provided. \n\nStarting with the main conditions:\n\n1. The user must have a disability and need special support for workforce integration, with the Federal Employment Agency as the rehabilitation provider. \n\nLooking at the ontology, 'hasDisability' is a data property of Person, so the user must have ff:hasDisability true. Also, 'workforceIntegrationProblemBecause' links to Disability, so there must be a Disability instance connected here. The rehabilitation provider should be ff:FedralEmploymentAgency, so the user must have ff:hasRehabilitationProvider with that individual.\n\nNext, participation in one of the listed measures. The measures are types of Training or similar. For example, VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, etc. The user must have ff:participates in a Training that is one of these subclasses. \n\nThen, the 3-year prior employment period conditions. The user must meet one of three criteria in the last 3 years:\n- At least 12 months of social security (ff:socialSecurityDuration with monthsWithinLast3Years ≥12)\n- Eligible for unemployment benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842) and has applied (maybe ff:receivedWithinLast3Years or another property? Wait, the ontology has ff:eligibleWithinLast3Years for SocialBenefit. So maybe the user's unemployment benefit instance has eligibleWithinLast3Years true and they have applied (but how to model that? Maybe the user must have receivesBenefit or wasEligibleFor?)\n\nAlternatively, the user must be eligible for unemployment benefit and has applied. The unemployment benefit is ff:B100019_LB_576842. So perhaps the user must have a relation like ff:isEligibleFor that benefit and maybe a flag indicating they applied. But the ontology doesn't have an 'applied' property. Hmm, maybe the example uses 'hasValue' for the benefit they receive. Alternatively, perhaps the user's income or employment status reflects that. Not sure. Maybe the requirement is just that they are eligible, so ff:isEligibleFor失业金.\n\nThird option: entitled to SVG unemployment benefit (ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG). The user must have ff:isEligibleFor that.\n\nSo for the prior employment period, the user must have at least one of these three conditions. This would require a SHACL OR condition, but SHACL Core doesn't support OR directly. So maybe use sh:or with multiple shapes, but the user has to have at least one of the three properties.\n\nAlternatively, for each condition, have a shape that checks if any of them is true, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, each condition can be a separate path with sh:or.\n\nNow, exceptions:\n\n- If the user is a vocational returnee (ff:isVocationalReturnee true), the prior employment period condition is waived. So we need to exclude that case somehow. Maybe using sh:qualifiedMinCount with a filter.\n\n- If in the last year before starting the measure, they have a recognized qualification. The user must have a Training commission by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true) and the training's duration's monthsWithinLast3Years >= 12? Or maybe the training was within the last year and meets certain criteria. The ontology has ff:recognizedByLaw which links to LegalCode, so maybe that's needed.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me structure step by step.\n\nFirst, create a NodeShape targeting ff:User for the benefit ff:B100019_LB_102716305.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Disability and need support:\n- ff:hasDisability must be true.\n- They must have a Disability instance linked via ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause, which also has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true (since the disability needs to reduce work prospects).\n- The rehabilitation provider must be ff:FedralEmploymentAgency.\n\n2. Participation in eligible training:\n- ff:participates must link to a Training that is a subclass of VocationalTraining, EntryProcedure..., etc. Need to check the ontology for exact classes. The examples include VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, etc. So the Training must be one of those subclasses. Using sh:class with each possible subclass in sh:or.\n\n3. Prior employment period conditions:\n- Either:\n   a) socialSecurityDuration has monthsWithinLast3Years ≥12\n   b) isEligibleFor失业金 and has applied (not sure how to model applied, but maybe just eligible)\n   c) isEligibleFor SVG失业金.\n\nThese are OR conditions. To model OR in SHACL Core, we can use sh:or with multiple shapes each checking one of the conditions, but each requires the path to exist. Alternatively, use a SPARQL constraint, but the user said to use only SHACL Core. Hmm, tricky. Maybe each condition is a separate property with sh:or in the sh:property.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:or on the paths. But I might need to represent this as three separate properties each with a condition, and the presence of any one is sufficient. Since SHACL Core can't do OR, maybe use a shape with three properties, each having sh:minCount 1 but with sh:or on the conditions? Not sure. Alternatively, use sh:or with each option as a different shape.\n\nWait, the example given uses sh:hasValue for the citizen benefit. Maybe the prior conditions can be structured as a set of possible paths that must have at least one present.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the three options, create a path that must have a certain value, and use sh:or to require that at least one is true.\n\nFor example:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:or ( ff:socialSecurityDuration, ff:isEligibleFor失业金, ff:isEligibleForSVG失业金 ) ];\n    ... but this might not work as needed.\n\nAlternatively, each condition can be a separate property with a filter, and the user must have at least one.\n\nWait, maybe using sh:or in the sh:property:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:socialSecurityDuration ),\n    sh:minCount 1,\n    sh:hasValue [ ff:monthsWithinLast3Years >= 12 ]\n],\nsh:or (\n    [ sh:path ( ff:isEligibleFor ),\n      sh:minCount 1,\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ],\n    [ sh:path ( ff:isEligibleFor ),\n      sh:minCount 1,\n      sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ]\n)\n\nBut I'm not sure if SHACL Core allows this. Maybe it's better to model each condition as a separate property with a constraint, and require that at least one is present. But how to express that in SHACL Core?\n\nAlternatively, since the user must have at least one of the three, maybe use three separate properties with sh:minCount 0, and then use sh:closed to ensure that at least one is present. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to structure each of the three conditions as a separate shape with their own constraints, and then have the main shape use sh:or to require that at least one is true. For example:\n\nThe main shape includes a sh:property that requires one of the three conditions via sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, this might be getting too complicated. Maybe the example's approach is better, using separate shapes for each condition and combining with OR.\n\nAlternatively, I can proceed step by step, ensuring each condition is covered, even if some parts are approximated.\n\nAlso, the exceptions: if the user is a vocational returnee (ff:isVocationalReturnee true), then the prior employment condition is not needed. So we can use sh:qualifiedMinCount where the condition is not required if the user has isVocationalReturnee true.\n\nAnother exception: if within the last year before starting the measure, they have a qualification. The user must have a Training commissioned by the agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true) and the training's duration's monthsWithinLast3Years >=12? Or perhaps the training's start date was within the last year. But the ontology has ff:intendedFundingPeriod which points to a Duration. Maybe the training's start is within last year, but the ontology doesn't have a direct property for that. Alternatively, the training's duration within last 3 years meets certain criteria. This part might be ambiguous, so according to the rules, we shouldn't model ambiguous requirements. So maybe ignore the exception unless it's clear.\n\nGiven the strict rules, perhaps the exceptions are too vague or require third-party assessment, so we won't include them unless explicitly modelable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape will have:\n\n- NodeShape targeting ff:User for the benefit.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. hasDisability is true.\n\n2. workforceIntegrationProblemBecause links to a Disability that has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n\n3. hasRehabilitationProvider is ff:FedralEmploymentAgency.\n\n4. participates in a Training that is one of the allowed types.\n\n5. The prior employment period conditions (one of the three).\n\nAdditionally, the exceptions may be omitted if they can't be clearly modeled.\n\nLet me draft the Turtle code step by step.\n\nFirst, define the shape for the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102716305 a ff:SocialBenefit;\n    rdfs:label \"Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de, \"Transitional allowance for people with disabilities\"@en .\n\nThe NodeShape:\n\nff:Übergangsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # hasDisability must be true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # workforceIntegrationProblemBecause links to Disability with reducesWorkProspectsPermanently\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability ; # Ensure it's a Disability instance\n        sh:message \"User must have a disability reducing work prospects permanently.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Check the linked Disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Disability must reduce work prospects permanently.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FedralEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Participation in eligible training\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:or (\n                sh:ClassShape ( ff:VocationalTraining )\n                sh:ClassShape ( ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea )\n                sh:ClassShape ( ff:School ) # If School is part of allowed measures?\n                # Need to check all the allowed training types\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Must participate in an eligible training program.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Prior employment period conditions\n    sh:or (\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration / ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ]\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; # Unemployment benefit\n            ]\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ; # SVG benefit\n            ]\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    # Exceptions handling: vocational returnee\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 0 ; # If true, then prior conditions not needed?\n        # Not sure how to model exclusion condition. Maybe use a SPARQL constraint?\n    ]\n    # The exceptions are tricky. Since we can't use SPARQL, maybe the user can either be a returnee (and thus exempt from prior conditions) or meet the prior conditions.\n    # So the OR includes the prior conditions and also being a returnee.\n    # So the sh:or would also include a condition checking for isVocationalReturnee true, making the prior conditions optional.\n    # Wait, this requires a logical OR between being a returnee OR meeting prior conditions.\n    # So the main sh:or should include all three prior conditions plus a condition where isVocationalReturnee is true.\n    # Thus, the entire sh:or would be four conditions:\n    # Either:\n    # 1. socialSecurityDuration >=12\n    # 2. eligible for unemployment\n    # 3. eligible for SVG\n    # 4. isVocationalReturnee true\n    # So the user must have at least one of these four.\n    # So adjust the sh:or accordingly.\n\n    # Recalculating the sh:or:\n    sh:or (\n        [ # Social security condition\n            sh:property [ sh:path [ ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ] ; sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ]\n        [ # Unemployment benefit eligible\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ]\n        [ # SVG benefit eligible\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ]\n        [ # Vocational returnee\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue true ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    # Also, the user must be participating in training, etc.\n    # Wait, the participation is already a separate constraint.\n\nThis approach might work, but I need to ensure all parts are correctly structured.\n\nAdditionally, the exception about having a qualification within the last year is unclear, so perhaps omitted.\n\nNow, writing this into Turtle syntax, ensuring all prefixes are included.\n\nAlso, the main shape's target is ff:User, and each property must be correctly linked.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The participation in training requires the Training to be one of the subclasses. Using sh:class with a NodeShape that uses sh:or over the allowed classes.\n\n- The socialSecurityDuration path may need to ensure the user has a socialSecurityDuration node with monthsWithinLast3Years ≥12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the socialSecurityDuration is a Duration instance linked via ff:socialSecurityDuration, and its monthsWithinLast3Years is checked.\n\nAlso, for the 'participates' property, the allowed classes are:\n\n- VocationalTraining\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n- \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" – which might be another subclass, but not sure. Looking back at the ontology, the listed subclasses under Training are VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, School, and others?\n\nThe ontology shows that EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and School are subclasses of Training. \"Unterstützte Beschäftigung\" isn't listed, but maybe part of VocationalTraining or another. Since it's unclear, perhaps stick to the ones explicitly listed in the ontology.\n\nPerhaps the user's participation must be in a Training that is either VocationalTraining, EntryProcedure..., or School. The exact allowed types need to be covered.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement's example uses 'or other recognized providers', but ontology may not have those, so use what's present.\n\nAnother point: the user must be participating in one of the listed measures. So the ff:participates must link to a Training (or subclass) that is one of the allowed types.\n\nPutting all together in Turtle:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102716305 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de, \"Transitional allowance for people with disabilities\"@en .\n\nff:Übergangsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [ # hasDisability must be true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ # workforceIntegrationProblem links to Disability with reducesWorkProspectsPermanently\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a disability reducing work prospects.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ # Check the disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause/ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Disability must reduce work prospects permanently.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ # Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FedralEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ # Participation in allowed training\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ # The training must be one of the subclasses\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:or (\n                sh:Class ( ff:VocationalTraining )\n                sh:Class ( ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea )\n                sh:Class ( ff:School ) # Assuming School is part of allowed measures\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Must participate in an eligible training program.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or ( # One of the prior conditions or exception\n        [ sh:property [ \n            sh:path [ ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ] ; \n            sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"At least 12 months social security in last 3 years required.\"@en ;\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ \n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; \n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; \n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"Must be eligible for unemployment benefit.\"@en ;\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ \n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; \n            sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ; \n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"Must be eligible for SVG unemployment benefit.\"@en ;\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ \n            sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; \n            sh:hasValue true ; \n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"User is a vocational returnee (exempt from prior conditions).\"@en ;\n        ] ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet prior employment period requirements or exception.\"@en .\n\nWait, the sh:or should wrap all those conditions, so each of the four is a possible path.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the 'Kinderzuschlag' benefit based on the given requirements. Let me start by understanding the problem and the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, the user's task is to generate a SHACL graph for eligibility requirements. The example given is for the same benefit, so I should check that for reference. The key points from the text are:\n\n1. **Child Requirements**:\n   - Child must be under 25 years old.\n   - Not married or in a civil partnership.\n   - Lives in the same household as the user.\n\n2. **Child Benefit Receiving**:\n   - The user must receive child benefit (Kindergeld) or equivalent for the child(ren).\n\n3. **Income Conditions**:\n   - As a couple: combined gross income at least 900€/month (excluding Wohngeld, Kindergeld, Kinderzuschlag).\n   - As a single parent: personal gross income at least 600€/month.\n\n4. **Income Offset**:\n   - The income considered must not reduce the child supplement to zero.\n\n5. **Assets**:\n   - No considerable assets.\n\n6. **Covering Family Needs**:\n   - Income, child benefit, housing benefit, and child supplement must cover family needs under SGB II.\n\n7. **Priority Claims**:\n   - The benefit is subordinate to other possible child incomes; must pursue priority claims like alimony.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the SHACL uses node shapes with properties for each condition. Let's map each requirement to SHACL constraints using the ontology.\n\nStarting with the child conditions. The example uses a child shape with hasAge, marital status, sameHouseholdAs, and hasNoPriorityClaimsOver. The ontology has ff:hasAge (int), maritalStatus (MaritalStatus, which includes Married, CivilUnion), and sameHouseholdAs (Person to Person). Also, hasNoPriorityClaimsOver links to SocialBenefit. So for the child, the shape should check:\n\n- hasAge <25\n- hasMaritalStatus not in (Married, CivilUnion)\n- sameHouseholdAs User\n- hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the benefit (B100019_LB_581863).\n\nThe income conditions: The example uses two shapes (IncomeShapeA and B for couple/single). The couple check is isSingleParent false and familyGrossIncome >=900. Single parent is isSingleParent true and personalGrossIncome >=600.\n\nWait, the text says \"als Paar\" (as a couple) and \"als alleinerziehende Person\" (single parent). So the ff:isSingleParent data property should be used here. So the IncomeShapeA requires isSingleParent false and familyGrossIncome (on the Income node) >=900. IncomeShapeB isSingleParent true and personalGrossIncome (on the Income node) >=600.\n\nThe income offset condition: The user's income that's offset must not reduce the child supplement to zero. The ontology has ff:reducesChildSupplementTo on Income, so check that this value is >0.\n\nAssets: hasConsiderableAssets must be false. The data property is ff:hasConsiderableAssets (boolean).\n\nCovering family needs: The user must be able to cover the family's basic needs with their income, assets, priority benefits. The ontology has canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit (boolean), which should be true.\n\nPriority claims: The child must have no priority claims over the benefit. Wait, the example already included hasNoPriorityClaimsOver for the child. But the requirement also mentions the user must pursue priority claims for the child. But the example's ChildShape includes hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, so that's covered.\n\nNow, putting it all together in SHACL:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User. It must have at least one child via receivesChildBenefitFor, with the child's shape. Then, the income conditions via sh:or between IncomeShapeA and B. Also, the income's reducesChildSupplementTo must be >0. The hasConsiderableAssets must be false. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be true.\n\nWait, the covering needs part says \"den Bedarf der ganzen Familie im Sinne des SGB II decken können.\" Which translates to canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being true. The ontology has canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit as a data property on Person, so a constraint on that.\n\nAlso, the priority claims part for the user: the benefit is subordinate to other claims, so the user must have no priority claims? Or that the child has none? The example included hasNoPriorityClaimsOver on the child, which seems right because it's about the child's other benefits taking priority.\n\nPutting all the constraints:\n\n- receivesChildBenefitFor must have at least one child that meets the child shape.\n- Either IncomeShapeA or B.\n- hasIncome's reducesChildSupplementTo >0\n- hasConsiderableAssets is false\n- canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is true.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for the properties:\n\n- receivesChildBenefitFor is an object property from Person to Person (child). So the user must have at least one child linked via that.\n- The child's shape requires the child's hasAge <25, marital status not married/civil union, sameHouseholdAs User, and hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the benefit.\n\nWait, the example's ChildShape has \"hasNoPriorityClaimsOver\" pointing to the benefit. That's because the child should not have other benefits that have priority over the child supplement. So that's correct.\n\nNow, building the SHACL step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape KinderzuschlagShape:\n\n- targetNode is ff:User\n- properties:\n   - receivesChildBenefitFor: minCount 1 with qualifiedValueShape (ChildShape)\n   - sh:or between IncomeShapeA and B\n   - property for reducesChildSupplementTo via hasIncome, must be >0 (minExclusive 0)\n   - hasConsiderableAssets must be false\n   - canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be true\n\nThe IncomeShapeA requires:\n- isSingleParent is false\n- familyGrossIncome (from hasIncome) >=900\n\nIncomeShapeB requires:\n- isSingleParent true\n- personalGrossIncome (from hasIncome) >=600\n\nAdditionally, the user must have the income linked via hasIncome, so those node shapes should check that the path exists.\n\nWait, in the example, the IncomeShapeA and B use sh:property with sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome), so they first follow hasIncome then familyGrossIncome. So the user must have an Income node, and the Income has familyGrossIncome (for couples) or personalGrossIncome (for singles).\n\nThe canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is a data property on the user, so a constraint on ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be true.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe SHACL code would have:\n\nMain Shape:\n\nff:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"No eligible children.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or ( ff:IncomeShapeA ff:IncomeShapeB ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ) ;\n        sh:minExclusive 0 ;\n        sh:message \"Income reduces child supplement to zero.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Considerable assets present.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Cannot cover family needs.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nChildShape:\n\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 25 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [ sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;  # The benefit itself\n    ] .\n\nIncomeShapeA (for couples):\n\nff:IncomeShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in ( \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ) ;  # Or using sh:hasValue false\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome ) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n    ] .\n\nIncomeShapeB (for singles):\n\nff:IncomeShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in ( \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ) ;  # Or hasValue true\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome ) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, in SHACL, the boolean values can be checked with sh:hasValue or sh:in. For example, in the example, they used sh:in (false) for isSingleParent. Wait in the example's IncomeShapeA:\n\nIn the example's IncomeShapeA:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in (false) ;\n]\n\nWait, but in the ontology, isSingleParent is a xsd:boolean, so in Turtle, it would be \"false\"^^xsd:boolean. So in SHACL, when using sh:in, the list should have the literal. But in the example, they used sh:in (false) without the datatype. Maybe because the ontology defines the data property's range as boolean, so SHACL can infer it? Or perhaps in Turtle, it's better to include the datatype.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was using a shorthand. To be safe, I'll use the full form.\n\nWait, looking at the example's code:\n\nIn their IncomeShapeA, they have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in (false) ;\n]\n\nWhich works if the data is stored as a boolean. Since the ontology defines isSingleParent as a boolean, this is acceptable. So I can follow that.\n\nAdditionally, the example uses \"sh:in (false)\", so I can do the same here.\n\nThus, in IncomeShapeA:\n\nsh:in (false)\n\nAnd in IncomeShapeB:\n\nsh:in (true)\n\nNow, checking all requirements:\n\n- The child's marital status: not Married or CivilUnion.\n\n- The income conditions with OR between couple and single.\n\n- The income reduction check.\n\n- The assets check.\n\n- The family needs check.\n\n- The priority claims on the child.\n\nThat covers all the requirements listed. The example also included the 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' on the child, which handles the requirement about the benefit being subordinate to other claims.\n\nI think that's all. Let me structure the Turtle code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_581863 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Kinderzuschlag\"@de, \"Child supplement\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Must have at least one eligible child\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"No eligible children fulfilling criteria.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Income conditions (couple or single parent)\n    sh:or (\n        ff:IncomeShapeA\n        ff:IncomeShapeB\n    ) ;\n    # Income offset must not reduce child supplement to zero\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo) ;\n        sh:minExclusive 0 ;\n        sh:message \"Child supplement reduced to zero by income.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # No considerable assets\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Considerable assets detected.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must cover family needs with combined resources\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Inadequate means to cover family needs.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# Child eligibility criteria\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Child must be under 25\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 25 ;\n    ] ;\n    # Not married or in civil partnership\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must live in same household as applicant\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] ;\n    # No priority claims over child supplement\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ] .\n\n# Income condition for couples\nff:IncomeShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in (false) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n    ] .\n\n# Income condition for single parents\nff:IncomeShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Bürgergeld' (Citizen benefit) with IDLB B100019_LB_106311931 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be employable. That means they can work at least 3 hours a day and are at least 15 years old but haven't reached the pensionable age. The pensionable age is 67 if born after 1963, but varies for those born earlier. Since SHACL can't compute exact age based on birth year, maybe the ontology has a property for age and another for pensionable status. Looking at the ontology, there's ff:hasAge (xsd:int) and ff:isPensionable (xsd:boolean). So the user's age must be >=15 and !isPensionable.\n\nNext, the user must be in need of assistance. They can't cover their basic needs and those of their dependents with their own resources and priority benefits. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit (xsd:boolean). This should be false. Also, they shouldn't have priority claims over other benefits. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, which links to the benefit. Wait, the condition says \"no priority claims over other providers or persons.\" Maybe using ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the benefit they're applying for, but the exact modeling is needed here.\n\nThey must live in Germany. The property ff:countryOfResidence should be Germany (ff:Germany).\n\nThe user must reside in the country. The countryOfResidence must be Germany.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes. The target is ff:User. Each condition becomes a shape constraint.\n\nFor employability: Check ff:hasAge >=15, and ff:isPensionable is false. Also, ff:employableHoursPerDay >=3.0. But how to express these in SHACL?\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:hasAge (domain Person, range xsd:int). So for age >=15, use sh:minInclusive 15 on ff:hasAge. The pensionable check: sh:property with path ff:isPensionable, sh:hasValue false.\n\nEmployable hours: ff:employableHoursPerDay must be >=3.0. So sh:minInclusive 3.0 on that property.\n\nFor the basic needs: ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be false. So sh:hasValue false.\n\nNo priority claims: The user must have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link to the benefit (B100019_LB_106311931). Wait, the condition says they have no priority claims over other benefits. Maybe the user must not have any ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor for higher priority benefits. Alternatively, the ontology might model this via ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to the benefit. The example used sh:hasValue for a specific benefit, so perhaps the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the benefit itself. Hmm, maybe the user must have a statement that they have no such claims. Alternatively, maybe the user must not have certain other benefits. Need to check ontology again.\n\nLooking at the ontology's ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver: \"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So the user must have a link to this benefit (B1000119...) via hasNoPriorityClaimsOver. So the user should have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ff:B100019_LB_106311931. So in SHACL, that would be a constraint requiring that the user has that property with the benefit as value. Wait, but maybe it's a flag? Or maybe the presence of this link indicates that they have no priority claims over this benefit. So the constraint would require that the user has that property pointing to the benefit. Alternatively, maybe the user must have the property set such that they have no other claims. Hmm, perhaps the example can guide here.\n\nIn the example for Einstiegsgeld, they used sh:hasValue for the citizen benefit. So perhaps here, for the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, it's required that the user has that property pointing to the benefit. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; \n    ...\n]\n\nBut maybe the user just needs to have that property exist, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the presence of that property with the benefit as value indicates they meet the condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a boolean flag. Wait, looking at the ontology, ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is an object property to SocialBenefit, so the user must link to the benefit they are applying for via that property. So that's the way.\n\nAlso, living in Germany: ff:countryOfResidence must be Germany. So a constraint on ff:countryOfResidence with sh:hasValue ff:Germany.\n\nPutting all together, the shape will have multiple sh:property constraints for each condition.\n\nNow, checking for any other constraints. The user must not have priority benefits like Arbeitslosengeld (Unemployment benefit), Wohngeld (Housing benefit), etc. But how to model that? Since the condition says \"can't cover needs with priority benefits\", maybe it's covered by the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false, which already accounts for those. So perhaps no need to explicitly check for those benefits unless required.\n\nThe SHACL shape would thus target ff:User and include all the constraints above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:BürgergeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Erwerbsfähigkeit: mindestens 3 Stunden täglich arbeiten können\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3.0\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"User must be able to work at least 3 hours per day.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # Erwerbsfähigkeit: mindestens 15 Jahre alt und nicht pensionabel\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ], [\n        # Hilfsbedürftigkeit: kann Basic-Needs nicht decken\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ], [\n        # Keine vorrangigen Ansprüche\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Self-reference to benefit\n    ], [\n        # Wohnort in Deutschland\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit described in the given text. The task is to validate if a user (targeting node ff:User) meets the eligibility criteria based on the ontology provided. Let me start by carefully reading the requirements from the text.\n\nThe social benefit in question is \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user receives basic income support (Grundsicherung).\n2. The necessity of the support was determined in a conversation with an integration specialist.\n3. The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure began.\n\nFirst, I'll map these requirements to the ontology.\n\n1. **Receives basic income support**: The Grundsicherung is a social benefit. Looking at the ontology, there's an individual called ff:SocialAssistance which is a type of SocialBenefit. But wait, in the examples, there's an example where \"Grundsicherung\" is linked to ff:L100040_LB_8664880. However, in the provided ontology, the closest match for Grundsicherung is the individual SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance). Wait, looking back at the ontology's individuals, there's an entry:\n\n   Individual: ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n      Annotations: rdfs:label \"Housing benefit\"@en, rdfs:label \"Wohngeld\"@de\n      Types: ff:SocialBenefit \n\nHmm, that's Wohngeld (housing benefit). The example given earlier used ff:L100040_LB_8664880 for Grundsicherung, but that's not present in the ontology provided. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake? Alternatively, maybe the correct SocialBenefit for Grundsicherung is actually SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance). Let me check the ontology again. \n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals: \n\n- SocialAssistance is listed as a SocialBenefit. Since Grundsicherung is the German term for basic security, which is often called \"Grundsicherung\" in some contexts, perhaps SocialAssistance is the correct mapping here. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing individual in the ontology. Since the user's example used a different URI, but the ontology doesn't have it, I'll proceed with the available data. Let me check the example provided by the user. In the example, they used:\n\nsh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880 ; # Grundsicherung\n\nBut in the ontology provided here, the closest is ff:L100040_LB_8665924 which is Wohngeld. This might be an inconsistency. Since the user's example uses that, perhaps it's an error, but since in the given ontology, perhaps the correct SocialBenefit for Grundsicherung is ff:SocialAssistance. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to another benefit. Wait, looking at the ontology again:\n\nThere's an individual called IntegrationAssistance (ff:IntegrationAssistance) which is a SocialBenefit. Maybe that's part of the Grundsicherung? Alternatively, perhaps the example had a typo. Since the ontology includes SocialAssistance, which is the standard term for basic income support in Germany, I'll use that.\n\nSo, the first condition: the user must receive SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance). Wait, but in the example, they used a different URI. Hmm, maybe I should check the ontology again for any other SocialBenefit related to Grundsicherung. Alternatively, perhaps the correct one is SocialAssistance. Let me proceed with that.\n\n2. **Necessity determined by integration specialist**: This part is tricky. The ontology has properties like ff:participates (links a person to a training program) but the requirement is about a conversation with an integration specialist. The ontology doesn't have a direct property for this. Since SHACL can't model this unless there's a property in the ontology that captures this, but looking at the ontology's properties, there's nothing about consultations with specialists. The example used ff:receivesBenefit for the first condition, so maybe this is another property. Alternatively, perhaps the participation in a program with the integration specialist is required. Alternatively, maybe this is an implicit condition that can't be modeled because it's at the discretion of the specialist. The problem states not to model ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. Since this requirement's fulfillment depends on an external assessment, I might have to omit this condition as per the rules.\n\n3. **Participation approved by Jobcenter before the measure began**: The Jobcenter is likely the Employment Agency (FederalEmploymentAgency). The ontology has ff:FederalEmploymentAgency as a RehabilitationProvider. The requirement states that the participation was approved by the Jobcenter. Looking at properties, perhaps the training is commissioned by the Employment Agency. The ontology has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency (a data property on Training, which is a boolean). So if the user is participating in a training that was commissioned by the Employment Agency, that could be the condition. Additionally, the participation must be before the measure began. Wait, the measure (training) must have been approved before it started. The ontology has ff:participates (links a person to a training they are currently participating in), and perhaps the commissioning must be true. So the user must have a participation in a training that is commissioned by the employment agency.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shapes.\n\nFirst, the shape targets ff:User.\n\nFor the first condition: the user must receive SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance). So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n]\n\nSecond condition: Since it's about an external assessment, can't model, so skip.\n\nThird condition: The user must be participating in a training that is commissioned by the employment agency. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedValues [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ];\n  ];\n]\n\nWait, but SHACL requires using qualifiedValueShapes for this. Alternatively, using sh:sparql. But since the user specified to use only SHACL Core components, I need to use qualifiedValueShapes.\n\nSo, the participation must link to a Training instance where commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true. So the path would be ff:participates, and then the Training must have that property. Thus, the shape would have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValues [\n        a sh:NodeShape ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nAlternatively, maybe using sh:property with sh:hasValue on the commissionedBy... but since commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a data property on Training, it's better to use qualifiedValueShape.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape would have two properties: one for receiving SocialAssistance and another for participating in a commissioned training.\n\nAlso, the social benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102730340, which isn't listed in the ontology. However, in the example, they added the benefit's label. So in the SHACL, we need to define the benefit as an individual. But since the task is to generate the SHACL constraints, perhaps that's part of the graph.\n\nWait, the example included:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nSo I need to add that to the SHACL graph as well.\n\nNow, assembling all:\n\nThe SHACL graph would have:\n\n- Define the social benefit individual.\n- The shape (ff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape) targeting ff:User.\n- The properties for each condition.\n\nFinal SHACL:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\n# Shape for eligibility\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # User receives SocialAssistance\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"User must receive Social Assistance\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Participation in training commissioned by Employment Agency\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Training must be commissioned by the Employment Agency\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the second condition in the text says \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" which translates to \"The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure began.\" The commissioning by the Employment Agency (FederalEmploymentAgency) would imply that the Jobcenter (which is the FederalEmploymentAgency) approved it. So that's covered by the commissionedByEmploymentAgency property being true.\n\nThe second condition about the integration specialist's determination can't be modeled because there's no ontology property for that, so we skip it as per the rules.\n\nHence, the SHACL should have these two properties.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\n# Eligibility Shape\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Receives basic income support (Grundsicherung)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"User must currently receive Social Assistance (Grundsicherung)\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 3: Participation approved by Jobcenter before measure start\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n                sh:message \"Training must be commissioned by the Federal Employment Agency\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (B100019_LB_582429) based on the given conditions. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the provided ontology to make sure I understand the classes and properties involved. The benefit in question is about receiving injury allowance from statutory accident insurance when the user is unfit for work due to an insurance event like a work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease.\n\nThe example given for a similar benefit (B100019_LB_102716305) uses a NodeShape targeting ff:User with properties checking for having the right insurance and earning capacity. The example also includes a nested NodeShape for the triggering event's class. \n\nNow, applying this to the current problem: The user must have statutory accident insurance (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance) and their earning capacity must be UnfitForWork. The triggering event for this earning capacity must be one of the specified classes: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nI need to ensure that the SHACL shape correctly enforces these constraints. Let's start by defining the shape for the benefit. The target is always ff:User as per the instructions. \n\nFirst constraint: The user must have the statutory accident insurance. Using sh:hasValue with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance under ff:hasInsurance. \n\nSecond constraint: The user's earning capacity must be UnfitForWork. Using sh:in with that individual. Additionally, the triggering event of that earning capacity must be one of the allowed event types. So, a nested NodeShape (like in the example) is needed here. \n\nWait, in the example, they used sh:node to link to another shape for the node being checked. So the property ff:hasEarningCapacity should point to a node that must conform to another shape which checks the triggering event. \n\nTherefore, the main shape (GUVVerletztengeldShape) will have a property for ff:hasEarningCapacity, requiring it to be UnfitForWork, and then using sh:node to specify that the node (the EarningCapacity instance) must meet the CapacityReductionShape constraints.\n\nThe CapacityReductionShape would then have a property for ff:triggeringEvent, which must be an instance of one of the three classes (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease). \n\nI should check if the ontology includes these classes. Looking back, yes: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease are all subclasses of Event. So the sh:class constraints are correct. \n\nI need to make sure all prefixes are correctly defined. The example uses ff: and sh: prefixes, so I'll follow that. Also, the benefit itself should be declared with its URI and labels as in the example. \n\nNo other conditions are mentioned in the text, so I shouldn't add anything else. The user must not have ambiguous requirements, so I stick strictly to the given conditions. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Define the SocialBenefit individual with its ID and labels.\n- Create the main shape targeting ff:User.\n- First property: hasInsurance must include StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n- Second property: hasEarningCapacity must be UnfitForWork and its triggering event must be one of the allowed events.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the Turtle code accordingly, ensuring syntax correctness. Also, check that the node shapes are properly linked with sh:node and the classes are correctly referenced.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582429 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance injury allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVVerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582429 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: User must have statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance\"@en\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: User must be unfit for work due to an insurance event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:UnfitForWork ) ;\n        sh:node ff:UnfitForWorkShape ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unfit for work due to valid insurance event\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:UnfitForWorkShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Triggering event must be work/commuting accident or occupational disease\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Bildung und Teilhabe' with IDLB L100040_LB_12280162 based on the given conditions. Let's start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nThe eligibility criteria are for young people or their families receiving one of the listed benefits, or if they can't cover education and participation costs themselves. The age limit is up to 25 years, but participation in social/cultural life is supported up to 18.\n\nFirst, the SHACL shape must target ff:User. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **User must be under 25 years old**: This uses the hasAge data property. The maxInclusive would be 24 since it's before the 25th birthday.\n\n2. **Either the user or their family receives one of the specified benefits**:\n   - Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931)\n   - Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (maybe the combination of ff:L100040_LB_8665924 and ff:B100019_LB_581863)\n   - Sozialhilfe (ff:SocialAssistance)\n   - Asylbewerberleistungen (ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n   - Families with low income (this might be inferred via income properties, but the ontology doesn't have an explicit individual for this. Since the task says not to model ambiguous requirements, maybe this is covered by other properties like canCoverBasicNeeds? Hmm, but the example includes \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which might need checking if their family income is below a threshold. But since the ontology has familyGrossIncome, maybe check if it's below a certain value. Wait, but the text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" are included, but the SHACL must not invent terms. Since there's no explicit property for low income family, perhaps this part is ambiguous and cannot be modeled. The user must either have one of the listed benefits or can't cover costs. Since the text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten... nicht selbst decken kann...\" So the user must either have one of the benefits OR cannot cover the costs themselves.\n\nWait, the structure is: if they (or family) receive one of the benefits, OR if they can't cover the costs themselves. So the condition is an OR between the benefits and the inability to cover costs.\n\nSo the SHACL needs to model either:\n\n- The user or their family is receiving at least one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld + Kinderzuschlag, etc.), OR\n\n- The user cannot cover the costs (maybe via canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit or similar).\n\nBut how to model \"family\" in the ontology? The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome under ff:Income. Maybe the user has an Income with familyGrossIncome below a certain threshold. However, the exact threshold isn't specified here. Since the task requires not modeling ambiguous requirements, perhaps we can only check for the listed benefits and the inability to cover costs without specific income values.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" might be covered by the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. Let's see: the data property canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is \"True if a person can cover the basic needs of themselves and the unemployed individuals in their benefit unit with their income, assets, and priority benefits, false otherwise.\" So if this is false, they can't cover, which would fit the \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" part.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\n- The user has at least one of the listed benefits (received or eligible?), or\n\n- They cannot cover the costs (canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false).\n\nWait, the text says \"Families with low income\" are included in the first list, so the first part includes receiving those benefits OR being a family with low income. But the second part (if not receiving any, but can't cover costs) is another condition. Hmm, perhaps the user must satisfy either:\n\nEither:\n\n1. They or their family are receiving one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld+Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylleistungen), OR\n\n2. They cannot cover the costs (canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false).\n\nAdditionally, the user must be under 25.\n\nNow, translating to SHACL:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User. The conditions are:\n\n- hasAge < 25\n\nAND ( \n\n   ( hasIncome with familyGrossIncome below a certain value? No, maybe not. Wait, the listed benefits are SocialBenefit instances. So the user must have received (ff:receivesBenefit or ff:receivedBenefit) one of the benefits, or be eligible? The text says \"beziehen\" (receive), so probably ff:receivesBenefit.\n\n   So:\n\n   ( \n\n      ( ff:receivesBenefit one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag (combined?), etc.), OR\n\n      ( canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false )\n\n   )\n\nWait, the listed benefits include \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\", which are two separate benefits (Wohngeld is ff:L100040_LB_8665924 and Kinderzuschlag is ff:B100019_LB_581863). The user must be receiving both? Or either? The text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" together under §6b BKGG. So maybe the user must have both? Or is it either? The exact legal reference might require both. Since the ontology has them as separate SocialBenefits, I'll need to check if the user has both. But the example in the problem's example uses \"sh:or\" for similar cases. Alternatively, maybe the condition is receiving either of them, but the problem says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" together as a combined requirement. Hmm, ambiguous. Since the problem says not to model ambiguous parts, perhaps it's better to include both as required. But that might be too strict. Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to have either, but the wording says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" (and), so perhaps the user must have both. However, since the ontology doesn't have a combined SocialBenefit, maybe it's better to model receiving both, but that's complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must receive at least one of the listed benefits, including the combination. Since it's unclear, perhaps the best approach is to include each of the listed benefits as possible, including the Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag as separate, and let the OR include them. Since the user could have either, perhaps it's better to list them all as possible in the OR.\n\nSo the first part of the condition (either receiving one of the listed benefits) would involve checking if the user has a receivesBenefit link to any of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylleistungen). But the \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" might be a combined requirement. Since I can't be sure, I'll include them as separate options.\n\nThe listed benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931)\n\n- Wohngeld (ff:L100040_LB_8665924)\n\n- Kinderzuschlag (ff:B100019_LB_581863)\n\n- Sozialhilfe (ff:SocialAssistance)\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen (ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n\nAdditionally, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" might be covered by canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false, but the user must also not have any of the listed benefits. Wait, the text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten... nicht decken kann...\" So if they don't have any of the listed benefits, but can't cover costs, then they can have their eligibility checked. So the user must either:\n\n- have at least one of the listed benefits, OR\n\n- not have any of the listed benefits AND can't cover the costs (canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false).\n\nThis complicates things because it's a combination of absence and another condition. Since SHACL can't express negative conditions easily, maybe we need to model it as a disjunction between (has any of the benefits) OR (can't cover costs AND not having any of the benefits). But this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can have either the benefits OR the inability to cover costs. But that would allow someone who has a benefit and can't cover costs, which is okay. The problem is ensuring that if they don't have the benefits, they must be unable to cover costs.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see the problem statement again.\n\nThe user is eligible if:\n\n- They or their family receive any of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag, etc.), OR\n\n- They don't receive any of those benefits but can't cover the costs themselves.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\n(has one of the benefits) OR (not having any and can't cover costs)\n\nIn SHACL, this would require a NOT EXISTS for the benefits in the second part. However, SHACL doesn't have a direct NOT, but can use sh:closed to some extent. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it with a disjunction where one path is the existence of benefits, and the other is the inability plus no benefits. But this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe simplify to:\n\nEither the user has at least one of the listed benefits, OR they cannot cover the costs (regardless of benefits? No, because the text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, ... die Kosten... nicht decken kann\" so it's specifically if they don't have the benefits AND can't cover costs.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Since SHACL can't do negation, perhaps the best approach is to model it as a choice between having the benefits OR (can't cover costs AND not having any benefits). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false implies that they can't cover costs, which would include both scenarios where they have benefits but still can't cover (maybe overlapping?), but the problem states that if they have the benefits, they are eligible regardless of their ability to cover costs. So the main condition is:\n\n(age <25) AND ( (has any of the benefits) OR (not having any benefits AND can't cover costs) )\n\nBut in SHACL, this would require a shape with:\n\nsh:and ( \n\n  [ age condition ]\n\n  [ sh:or ( \n\n    [ has any of the benefits ]\n\n    [ sh:and ( \n\n      [ not has any benefits ]\n\n      [ can't cover costs ]\n\n    ) ]\n\n  ) ]\n\n)\n\nBut SHACL doesn't support NOT directly, so the second part (not having benefits) can't be expressed. Therefore, perhaps the problem requires us to model the condition as either having the benefits OR being unable to cover costs, ignoring the \"no benefits\" part. But that would allow someone who has benefits and can cover costs to still qualify, which is okay, but the text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" are included even without the benefits. So maybe the problem allows the can't cover costs condition regardless of benefits, but the first part includes those with benefits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can have either the benefits or the inability to cover, but the text says that the benefits are part of the first condition. So the \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" part is covered by the inability to cover. Hence, perhaps the condition is:\n\n(age <25) AND ( (has any of the benefits) OR (can't cover costs) )\n\nThat might be the best we can do without the negation. The user could have benefits and still need to have can't cover, but according to the text, if they have the benefits, they are eligible regardless of their ability to cover. So the can't cover is only required if they don't have the benefits. But without negation in SHACL, maybe we have to accept that the condition includes cases where they have the benefits and can cover, but that's okay because the benefit receipt is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the can't cover is required only if they don't have the benefits. Since this is complex and the problem says not to model ambiguous parts, perhaps the best is to model the disjunction between having the benefits OR not being able to cover costs, even though it might include some edge cases. The problem states \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten... nicht decken kann\" so the can't cover is required only if they don't have the benefits. But without a way to express the conjunction in SHACL's OR, maybe we have to proceed with the two conditions as OR.\n\nSo the final conditions are:\n\nUser must have:\n\n- hasAge <25\n\nAND\n\n( \n\n  ( receivesBenefit one of the listed benefits ) OR\n\n  ( canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false )\n\n)\n\nNow, translating to SHACL:\n\nThe main shape will have:\n\nsh:property for hasAge with maxExclusive 25.\n\nThen another property that is a sh:or between:\n\n- a path that checks if the user has any of the listed benefits via receivesBenefit,\n\n- a path that checks canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false.\n\nWait, the 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' is a boolean property. So to check if it's false, we can use sh:hasValue false, but since it's a data property, we need to ensure it exists and is false. Alternatively, using sh:equals.\n\nWait, the user must have canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit = false, so:\n\nsh:property [ \n\n  sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit;\n\n  sh:minCount 1;\n\n  sh:hasValue false;\n\n]\n\nBut SHACL has sh:hasValue which can check for exact values.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape for the benefit would be something like:\n\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape;\n\n    sh:targetNode ff:User;\n\n    # Age condition\n\n    sh:property [\n\n        sh:path ff:hasAge;\n\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int;\n\n    ];\n\n    # Eligibility conditions\n\n    sh:or ( \n\n        # Either receives one of the benefits\n\n        [ \n\n            sh:property [ \n\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n\n                sh:minCount 1;\n\n                sh:or ( \n\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]  # Bürgergeld\n\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]  # Wohngeld\n\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]   # Kinderzuschlag\n\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]    # Sozialhilfe\n\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] # Asyl...\n\n                );\n\n            ]\n\n        ]\n\n        # Or cannot cover the costs\n\n        [ \n\n            sh:property [ \n\n                sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit;\n\n                sh:minCount 1;\n\n                sh:hasValue false;\n\n            ]\n\n        ]\n\n    );\n\n    sh:message \"Does not meet eligibility criteria for Bildung und Teilhabe.\"@en .\n\nWait, but the first part (receiving one of the benefits) requires that the user has at least one of those benefits via receivesBenefit. So the sh:or within the ff:receivesBenefit's sh:or.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have at least one receivesBenefit link to any of those. So the shape for that part is:\n\nThe first option in the sh:or is a property shape that requires the user has a receivesBenefit with any of those SocialBenefit individuals.\n\nThe second option is the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that the user has the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit property. So the sh:property for canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must have sh:minCount 1 to ensure it's present.\n\nAdditionally, the user must be under 25, so hasAge must be present and less than 25.\n\nNow, also check the listed benefits:\n\nWait, the \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" are two separate benefits. The problem's text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§6b BKGG)\", which may mean the user must have both. If that's required, then the first condition would require the user to have both. But that's not clear. The example used sh:or for similar cases, so perhaps the user only needs one of them. Given the ambiguity, but the problem says not to model ambiguous parts, perhaps it's better to treat them as separate options in the OR.\n\nSo including all five benefits in the OR list.\n\nAnother point: the benefit also mentions \"Leistungen zur Teilhabe am sozialen und kulturellen Leben in der Gemeinschaft werden bis zur Vollendung des 18. Lebensjahres bezuschusst.\" But this might be an additional condition for part of the benefit, but the main eligibility is up to 25. Since the user needs to be under 25 for the main eligibility, perhaps that's covered by the existing age check.\n\nSo the SHACL shape should be as outlined above.\n\nNow, the SHACL code:\n\nFirst, define the shape for the benefit's conditions:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"Age must be under 25 years.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        # Condition 1: Receiving one of the listed benefits\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:or (\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ] # Bürgergeld\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]   # Wohngeld\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]    # Kinderzuschlag\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]     # Sozialhilfe\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] # Asylbewerberleistungen\n                ) ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:message \"Must be receiving one of the listed benefits.\"@en\n        ]\n        # Condition 2: Cannot cover costs\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue false ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:message \"Cannot cover basic needs of the benefit unit.\"@en\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet eligibility criteria for 'Bildung und Teilhabe'.\"@en .\n\nWait, but in SHACL's sh:or, each alternative is a node shape. So each condition in the sh:or is a NodeShape. So the first alternative is a NodeShape requiring that the receivesBenefit has any of the listed benefits. The second is a NodeShape requiring canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false.\n\nThis should work.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the user has the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit property present. The sh:minCount 1 in the second condition ensures that.\n\nI think this covers the requirements without introducing ambiguous parts. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is part of the ontology, and the listed benefits are correctly referenced.\n\nAnother check: the user must be under 25 years old. The hasAge is checked with maxExclusive 25.\n\nThis should be the correct SHACL graph.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Age requirement: under 25 years\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"Age must be under 25 years.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Eligibility conditions: either receive listed benefits OR cannot cover costs\n    sh:or (\n        # Condition 1: Receiving one of the listed benefits\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:or (\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ] # Bürgergeld\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]   # Wohngeld\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]    # Kinderzuschlag\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]     # Sozialhilfe\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] # Asylbewerberleistungen\n                ) ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:message \"Must be receiving one of the listed benefits.\"@en\n        ]\n        # Condition 2: Inability to cover costs\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue false ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:message \"Cannot cover basic needs of the benefit unit.\"@en\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet eligibility criteria for 'Bildung und Teilhabe'.\"@en .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the given social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\" (Statutory Accident Insurance Pension) with the IDLB B100019_LB_582404. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nThe user must be legally insured under statutory accident insurance. The pension is granted if:\n\n1. Their earning capacity is reduced:\n   - Due to one or more insurance events (Versicherungsfälle)\n   - Beyond the 26th week after the insurance event\n   - By at least 20%.\n\nFirst, I should check the ontology to find the relevant properties and classes. The insurance event is probably an instance of ff:Event, and the earning capacity reduction is related to ff:EarningCapacity. \n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:EarningCapacity has properties like reductionInPercent and reductionDurationInWeeks. Also, the insurance event needs to be linked via triggerEvent or something similar. Wait, the ontology has ff:triggeringEvent for EarningCapacity. So, the earning capacity's triggering event should be an instance of an insurance case, which might be one of the subclasses of Event like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc.\n\nThe reduction must be at least 20% (so reductionInPercent >= 20) and the duration beyond 26 weeks (reductionDurationInWeeks > 26). \n\nAlso, the user must have adequate health insurance (maybe ff:adequateHealthInsurance is true?), but the text says \"gesetzlich unfallversichert sind\" so maybe they must have Statutory Accident Insurance (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance). The user should have an ff:hasInsurance linked to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nWait, the text specifies \"gesetzlich unfallversichert sind\" which translates to being insured under statutory accident insurance. So the user must have an insurance of type ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So, in SHACL, that would be a property shape requiring that the user has an insurance with hasValue StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL constraints:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User and checks the following:\n\n1. The user has an insurance of type StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, but the insurance is an object property, so maybe the range is ff:Insurance. So, the user must have at least one insurance that is exactly ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. Alternatively, the user's hasInsurance must have a value that is an instance of StatutoryAccidentInsurance. But in the ontology, ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance is an individual of class ff:Insurance. So the hasInsurance should point to that individual. Wait, looking at the ontology:\n\nThe individual ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance is of type ff:Insurance. So, the user must have ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as the object. So, the SHACL constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance;\n    sh:message \"User must be insured under statutory accident insurance.\"@en;\n]\n\nBut wait, the text says \"gesetzlich unfallversichert sind\" which is statutory accident insured. So this is correct.\n\nNext, the earning capacity must be reduced (so the user's earning capacity is not FullEarningCapacity, but something like ReducedEarningCapacity). The earning capacity's reductionInPercent must be >= 20, and the reductionDurationInWeeks must be >26 weeks.\n\nSo the user must have an ff:EarningCapacity (maybe via ff:hasEarningCapacity?) which has those properties. Wait, looking at ontology properties: ff:hasEarningCapacity links a person to their earning capacity. So the user must have a hasEarningCapacity with certain properties.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL would need to:\n\n- The user must have an earning capacity (hasEarningCapacity with minCount 1).\n- That earning capacity must have:\n   - A triggeringEvent that is an instance of an insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.).\n   - reductionInPercent >= 20\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >26\n\nWait, but the reductionDurationInWeeks is the duration of the reduction, so it must be more than 26 weeks. So the value of reductionDurationInWeeks must be greater than 26.\n\nSo, the SHACL structure would be a shape for the EarningCapacity node, but since SHACL can traverse paths, we can use nested constraints.\n\nAlternatively, for the user's earning capacity:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal;\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int; // since >26, so 27 or more\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent;\n            sh:minCount 1;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n        ];\n    ];\n]\n\nWait, but the triggeringEvent must be an insurance event. Looking at the ontology, the insurance events are subclasses of Event, but which ones? The text mentions \"Versicherungsfälle\" which are covered by accident insurance. The ontology has several Event subclasses like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, CommutingAccident, SchoolAccident, KindergartenAccident. Those are all covered under statutory accident insurance. So the triggering event must be one of these.\n\nSo the triggeringEvent must be an instance of any of those classes. So the SHACL constraint for triggeringEvent would check that the value is a member of one of those classes.\n\nPutting this all together, the main shape for the benefit would have these constraints.\n\nAlso, the EarningCapacity itself must not be FullEarningCapacity. Since FullEarningCapacity has no reduction. So the earning capacity must be an instance of a subclass that indicates reduced capacity, like ReducedEarningCapacity. Wait, in the ontology, there's ff:ReducedEarningCapacity and ff:UnfitForWork. So the EarningCapacity must be one of those, but maybe we can just rely on the reduction properties. However, to be safe, maybe check that it's not FullEarningCapacity. But the problem says \"Erwerbsfähigkeit ist gemindert\", which means reduced, so it's not full.\n\nAlternatively, the existence of reductionInPercent and duration would imply that, but maybe better to ensure that the class is not FullEarningCapacity.\n\nWait, but in the ontology, ff:EarningCapacity is a class, and the individuals are like FullEarningCapacity, ReducedEarningCapacity, UnfitForWork. So the user's hasEarningCapacity must point to an instance that is not FullEarningCapacity. So perhaps adding a sh:class constraint excluding FullEarningCapacity.\n\nHmm, but the exact way might complicate. Alternatively, just rely on the reductionInPercent and duration. Since if reductionInPercent is >=20, that implies it's not full.\n\nSo proceeding with the properties.\n\nNow, putting this all into Turtle:\n\nThe main shape would be for the benefit (B100019_LB_582404), and the node shape targets ff:User.\n\nAlso, the benefit's individual must be defined with its label.\n\nWait the example had:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\nSo I need to add that for B100019_LB_582404.\n\nThe SHACL shape name can be something like ff:UnfallRenten, but the example used the benefit's ID as the shape name. Wait the example had:\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ; ... but the benefit ID was B100019_LB_102713860, so maybe the shape's name is the benefit's ID. Wait in the example, the shape is called ff:Einstiegsgeld but the benefit is B100019_LB_102713860. Maybe the shape is named after the benefit's label. Alternatively, perhaps the shape's name is arbitrary as long as it's a node shape targeting the user.\n\nAlternatively, follow the example's pattern. The example had a node shape named after the benefit's German name, like \"Einstiegsgeld\", so here maybe \"UnfallversicherungRente\".\n\nBut the key is to have the node shape target ff:User.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL would have:\n\n- Define the benefit individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\nThen the node shape:\n\nff:UnfallVersicherungRenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Check insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Must be insured under statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Check earning capacity\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # greater than 26\n                sh:message \"Reduction duration must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:class [\n                    a sh:NodeShape ;\n                    sh:or (\n                        [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] \n                        [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n                        [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n                        [ sh:class ff:SchoolAccident ]\n                        [ sh:class ff:KindergartenAccident ]\n                    )\n                ] ;\n                sh:message \"Triggering event must be an insurance case (work accident, occupational disease, etc.).\"@en ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20% beyond 26 weeks due to an insurance event.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the triggering event must be an instance of any of those classes. So the sh:class constraint for the triggeringEvent's value must be one of those classes. The way to express that in SHACL is using sh:or with sh:class constraints.\n\nAlternatively, in SHACL, for the path ff:triggeringEvent, the values must be instances of one of the allowed classes. So the qualified value shape for triggeringEvent can have a sh:class with a sh:or.\n\nWait, the triggeringEvent is an object property, so the target node of that property (the event) must be a member of any of the event classes. So the sh:class in the path constraint would be the union of those classes.\n\nSo the constraint for triggeringEvent's class:\n\nsh:class [ a sh:NodeShape ; sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ]\n\nWait, actually, the sh:or takes a list of sh:class constraints. So each element in sh:or is a node shape that requires the class.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:class [\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path a ; sh:hasValue ff:WorkAccident ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path a ; sh:hasValue ff:OccupationalDisease ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path a ; sh:hasValue ff:CommutingAccident ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path a ; sh:hasValue ff:SchoolAccident ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path a ; sh:hasValue ff:KindergartenAccident ] ]\n    )\n]\n\nBut that's complicated. Alternatively, using sh:or on the sh:class constraints.\n\nWait, according to SHACL, sh:class can take a list of classes, but maybe it's an OR. Wait the SHACL spec says that sh:class takes a list of classes, and the node must be a member of at least one of them.\n\nYes! So in SHACL, sh:class can take multiple classes, and the node must be an instance of any of them. So for the triggeringEvent:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n    sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n]\n\nWait, that's simpler. So the triggeringEvent's value must be a member of one of those classes.\n\nTherefore, the triggeringEvent constraint can be written as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n    sh:message \"The triggering event must be an insurance case.\"@en ;\n]\n\nSo putting that into the qualified value shape:\n\nSo the entire shape for the earning capacity part would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        a sh:NodeShape ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; \n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20% for over 26 weeks due to an insurance event.\"@en ;\n] .\n\nThat's better.\n\nNow, compiling all parts:\n\nThe SHACL would start with the prefixes, then define the benefit, then the node shape.\n\nWait, the example had:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nThen the benefit definition, then the node shape.\n\nSo the full Turtle would be:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# Define the SHACL shape\nff:UnfallRentenShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be insured under statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Earning capacity must be reduced appropriately\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # >26 weeks\n                sh:message \"Reduction duration must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n                sh:message \"Triggering event must be an insurance case (work accident, etc.).\"@en ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Earning capacity requirements not met.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\nWait, I need to ensure all the constraints are correctly placed. Also, the qualifiedValueShape applies to the hasEarningCapacity's value. So the qualified value shape is for the EarningCapacity instance. \n\nYes, this should cover all the requirements. Let me check:\n\n- User has ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance (correct)\n- The earning capacity (hasEarningCapacity) must exist and meet:\n   - reductionInPercent >=20\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27 (so over 26 weeks)\n   - triggeringEvent is one of the allowed event types.\n\nYes, that should do it. The messages are added for clarity. Also, the node shape is targeting the user.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# Validation shape for the user eligibility\nff:UnfallRentenShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement: Must be insured under statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be insured under statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement: Reduced earning capacity due to an insurance event\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Reduction must be at least 20%\n                sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Duration must exceed 26 weeks\n                sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; \n                sh:message \"Reduction duration must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Triggering event must be an insurance case\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ff:CommutingAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n                sh:message \"Triggering event must be an insurance case (work accident, etc.).\"@en ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Earning capacity requirements not met.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit described. The benefit is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' (Widow's/Widower's Pension) with IDLB B100019_LB_582441. Let me look at the requirements first.\n\nThe user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner who died due to an insured event: work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease. Also, the user must have been married or in a civil union before the event. \n\nNow, the exclusion: no claim if they married or formed the union after the event and the death happened within the first year of the union.\n\nStarting with the Shapes. The main shape targets ff:User. It should check for deceased spouse or civil partner. Using sh:or with two paths: deceasedCivilPartner and deceasedSpouse. Each should have a qualifiedValueShape that ensures the deceased had the required insurance and cause of death.\n\nThe qualifiedValueShape (DeceasedPartnerShape) needs to check two things: the deceased's insurance is StatutoryAccidentInsurance and their causeOfDeath is an event of the correct type (WorkAccident, etc.). Also, the legalUnionBeforeEvent must include the user.\n\nFor the exclusion part, it's a bit tricky. The user shouldn't have formed the union after the event, and the death within first year. So, need a shape that checks if the event's date plus one year is after the death date, and the union was formed after the event. But how to model that in SHACL?\n\nWait, the exclusion is a condition where the user is ineligible. So the SHACL should have a shape that must NOT be satisfied. So maybe a NOT condition. But SHACL doesn't have a NOT component, so perhaps using sh:not.\n\nAlternatively, the exclusion requires that either the user didn't form the union after the event, or the death wasn't within the first year. Wait, the user is ineligible if both conditions are true. So to ensure eligibility, it must be that it's not the case that both conditions are met. So in SHACL terms, we can model the inverse: the user must either not have formed the union after the event, or the death wasn't within the first year.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The user is ineligible if:\n\n1. The union was formed after the event (i.e., the event happened before the union started?), and\n\n2. The death occurred within the first year of the union.\n\nWait, the original says \"Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben und der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist.\"\n\nSo the event (Versicherungsfall) happened before the union was formed. Then the union was formed after the event. Then the death happened within the first year of the union. So in that case, the user is ineligible.\n\nTherefore, to be eligible, the user must NOT have both those conditions. So the SHACL must have a shape that ensures that either the union was not formed after the event, or the death wasn't within the first year.\n\nBut how to represent this in SHACL. Since SHACL can't do temporal reasoning (like dates), maybe the ontology has properties that can capture this? Let me check the ontology.\n\nLooking at the DataProperties: There's ff:hasDate on Event, which is the date when the event (cause of death) happened. The death date would be the date of the causeOfDeath event. The union's start date? The ontology doesn't have a property for when the union was formed. The legalUnionBeforeEvent property links the event to the user, but I don't see a property indicating the start date of the union. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. The exclusion condition requires knowing when the union was formed relative to the event's date and the death's date. Without such properties in the ontology, I can't model this. The problem states to not model ambiguous or third-party requirements. Since the ontology doesn't have the necessary properties (like marriage start date), I can't include this part. So the exclusion condition can't be modeled because the ontology lacks the necessary data properties. \n\nSo I'll proceed without it, as per the rules. But the user's example included the legalUnionBeforeEvent check. Wait in the example's SHACL for the same benefit, they required that the legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. Which ensures that the user was in the union before the event. That covers part of the requirement. The exclusion part requires more data that isn't present, so we can't include it. Therefore, proceed with the main requirements, ignoring the exclusion as it can't be modeled.\n\nSo, the main conditions are:\n\n- User has a deceased spouse or civil partner.\n\n- The deceased had statutory accident insurance.\n\n- The cause of death is an event of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\n- The user was in the union before the event (legalUnionBeforeEvent includes user).\n\nNow, building the SHACL:\n\nThe main shape is ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape targeting ff:User. The sh:or for the deceased paths.\n\nEach path (deceasedCivilPartner or deceasedSpouse) must have a qualifiedValueShape (DeceasedPartnerShape) that requires:\n\n1. ff:hasInsurance includes StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n2. ff:causeOfDeath has an event that is one of the three classes, and that event has legalUnionBeforeEvent including the user.\n\nWait, the InsuranceEventShape in the example had the legalUnionBeforeEvent check. Let me see:\n\nIn the example's InsuranceEventShape, they have a property:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent; sh:minCount 1; sh:in (ff:User) ]\n\nThat ensures that the legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. So that's correct.\n\nSo the structure is similar to the example. The only difference is the exclusion part which can't be modeled here.\n\nThus, the SHACL would be as in the example but with the correct IDs. The example's SHACL uses B100019_LB_582441, which matches the current problem's ID, so it's the same. Wait, the user provided an example for exactly this benefit. Wait, the user provided an example with the same text and SHACL. Wait, looking back, the user's examples section has exactly the same text and the SHACL. But the user's current task is to generate the same SHACL again? Or maybe it's a different benefit?\n\nWait, the user's input is the same as the example's text. The example's SHACL is correct, so perhaps the answer is the same as the example's SHACL. But the problem says to generate a validation graph for the described eligibility. Since the example's text and the current task's text are identical, the SHACL should be the same.\n\nWait, the user might be testing if I can reproduce the example correctly. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the TEXT provided here is exactly the same as the example's TEXT. So the correct answer is the same SHACL as in the example. But maybe the user wants to ensure that I can generate it correctly. Let me check again.\n\nThe example's SHACL uses ff:B100019_LB_582441, which is the same as the current problem's ID. The shapes are correctly structured. Therefore, the answer should be the same as the example's SHACL. However, maybe there's a typo in the example's SHACL, like a missing semicolon or something? Let me check syntax.\n\nLooking at the example's SHACL:\n\nff:GUVWitwenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582441 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:or ( ... )\n\nThe semicolons are correct. The DeceasedPartnerShape has properties with sh:hasValue and sh:node. The InsuranceEventShape has sh:or with three classes. All seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct SHACL is as in the example. The exclusion part can't be modeled because of missing ontology properties, so it's omitted as per the problem's rules.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance widow's pension\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVWitwenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582441 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n    ) .\n\nff:DeceasedPartnerShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Dceased person has statutory accident insurance'\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:InsuranceEventShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Death was caused by an insurance event' or 'User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:InsuranceEventShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:or (\n        [sh:class ff:WorkAccident]\n        [sh:class ff:CommutingAccident]\n        [sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease]\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' with the IDLB B100019_LB_574724 based on the given conditions. Let me start by parsing the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be eligible, so the shape targets ff:User. Let me look at the ontology to find relevant properties and classes.\n\nThe first condition is about where the user lives during the training. They shouldn't live with their parents if they're under 18, unless they're married, have a child living with them, or are over 18. The ontology has ff:parentalAddress which links to the parent's address. If they have an address there, maybe the 'tooFarFromTrainingCompany' data property on the address indicates it's too far. So, either they don't have a parental address (not living with parents) or if they do, they must be over 18, married, or have a child.\n\nNext, residency requirements: if they're not German, they shouldn't have an asylum-related residence permit (ff:hasAsylumActPermit) or be tolerated with less than 15 months in Germany (ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months). So, if they are not German, then check these two conditions.\n\nThey must not be able to cover the required expenses. The ontology has ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds, which should be false. Also, maybe ff:hasIncome's personalGrossIncome is low, but the data property might directly indicate inability.\n\nThe training must be their first (ff:isFirstVocationalTraining) or, if not, they can't be integrated otherwise. The training must be recognized under certain laws (ff:CraftsCode, ff:NursingProfessionsAct, ff:MaritimeLabourAct, ff:VocationalTrainingAct). So the training's ff:recognizedByLaw must be one of these. Also, they need a contract (ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract).\n\nFor disabilities, if they have one (ff:hasDisability), then the training must be adapted (maybe via ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to Disability?), but the exact property isn't clear. The example might use a shape with OR conditions here.\n\nTraining abroad: part of it can be abroad if under certain conditions. For example, if it's partially abroad (ff:monthsAbroad <= 12 months?), but the exact data properties like percentAbroad or monthsTotal need to be considered. The SHACL might need to check the percentage or duration against thresholds.\n\nAdditionally, for preparatory measures, they must be commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency).\n\nI need to structure these conditions into SHACL constraints. Each condition translates to a property with minCount or value constraints, using SHACL's core components. Since some conditions are OR-based, I'll use sh:or or sh:or in the shape's properties.\n\nLet me start with the NodeShape for the benefit. The target is ff:User. Then, each condition becomes a sh:property with appropriate constraints.\n\nFor example, the first condition about living situation:\n\nEither the user doesn't have a parental address, OR they are over 18, married, or have a child. Using sh:or:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:parentalAddress ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:maxCount 0 ]\n    [ sh:hasValue true ; ... but how to express the OR of age, marital status, or having a child? ]\n  )\n]\n\nWait, maybe better to structure as:\n\nIf they have a parental address (parentalAddress exists), then they must have age >=18 OR be married OR have a child. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:parentalAddress ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:message \"If living with parents, must meet age, marital status, or have child.\" ;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasAge ] ;  # Wait, ff:hasAge is a data property on Person, so maybe the path is ff:hasAge ?\n      sh:minInclusive 18\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Married ]\n      [ sh:path ff:hasChild ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n    )\n  ]\n]\n\nHmm, maybe it's getting too complex. Alternatively, split into separate constraints.\n\nAlternatively, for users who have a parental address (parentalAddress exists), they must have at least one of the three conditions. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:parentalAddress ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:exists false ]  # No parental address\n    [ sh:and (\n        [ sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18\n        ] ] \n        [ sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Married\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasChild ; sh:minCount 1\n        ] ]\n      ) ]\n    )\n  )\n]\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, use sh:or with multiple conditions.\n\nThis might get too nested. Perhaps better to handle each condition separately.\n\nAlternatively, the main conditions:\n\n1. Living situation: either not living with parents, or if they are, must be over 18, married, or have a child.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:parentalAddress ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:maxCount 0 ]  # no parental address\n    [ sh:and (\n        [ sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ]\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:Divorced ]\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:Widowed ]\n          )\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasChild ; sh:minCount 1\n        ] ]\n      ) ]\n    )\n  )\n]\n\nWait, but the user can have either age >=18 OR marital status (married etc.), or a child. So it's an OR between age condition, marital status, or child presence.\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complex. Perhaps better to structure each part with sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is too complicated, and the example in the problem uses simpler shapes. Maybe I can structure each condition as separate properties with their constraints.\n\nFor residency:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:exists true ]\n    [ sh:not [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ; sh:hasValue true\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ; sh:hasValue true\n      ]\n    ] ]\n  )\n]\n\nWait, if not German (so they have another nationality), then they must not have asylum permit and not be tolerated with <15 months. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ]\n    [ sh:and (\n        [ sh:not [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ; sh:hasValue true\n          ]\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:not [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ; sh:hasValue true\n          ]\n        ] ]\n      ) ]\n    )\n  )\n]\n\nHmm, this might be manageable.\n\nFor the financial part, can't cover personal needs:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n  sh:hasValue false ;\n]\n\nFor training being first or other conditions:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true\n      ] ]\n      [ sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ; sh:minCount 1\n      ] ]\n    )\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, if not first, then workforceIntegrationProblemBecause must exist (disability?), but the exact property might be different.\n\nAlternatively, the training must be first, or if not first, then they can't be integrated otherwise. The condition says \"if it's not first: must be unable to integrate otherwise\".\n\nThe exact ontology property for that isn't clear. Maybe the training has a ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to Disability, but the user's disability's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a Disability that reduces their work prospects permanently.\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n  sh:minCount 0 ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true\n    ] ]\n    [ sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n      sh:minCount 1\n    ] ]\n  )\n]\n\nNot sure. This might need more precise ontology terms.\n\nThe training must be recognized under certain laws. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n  sh:in (\n    ff:CraftsCode\n    ff:NursingProfessionsAct\n    ff:MaritimeLabourAct\n    ff:VocationalTrainingAct\n  )\n]\n\nAnd the contract:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingContract\n]\n\nFor abroad conditions, maybe:\n\nIf training is partially abroad (monthsAbroad > 0), then:\n\nEither:\n\n- partial abroad (monthsAbroad <= 12 months)\n- or total abroad but meets other criteria (like equivalence)\n\nBut the exact properties need to be checked. The ontology has ff:monthsAbroad and ff:percentAbroad. For partial abroad (part of training abroad):\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:monthsAbroad ;\n  sh:maxInclusive 12\n]\n\nFor total abroad, need equivalence certification, but that's an object property maybe not modeled here. Since the user can't model terms outside the ontology, perhaps we can only check the duration.\n\nThis is getting complicated. The example might simplify some parts, focusing on the properties available.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle, ensuring all conditions are covered with SHACL constraints, using the ontology's properties and classes. Each condition must be translated into a shape with appropriate path, minCount, hasValue, or other SHACL constraints. Also, using sh:or and sh:and where necessary to combine conditions.\n\nFinally, the shape must target ff:User and be valid SHACL Core.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_574724 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe\"@de, \"Vocational Training Allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:B100019_LB_574724_Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Wohnortbedingungen\n        sh:path ff:parentalAddress ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:maxCount 0 ]  # Keine Elternadresse\n            [ sh:and (\n                # Ist mindestens 18 Jahre alt, verheiratet oder hat Kinder\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ] ]\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:or ( [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ] [ sh:hasValue ff:Widowed ] [ sh:hasValue ff:Divorced ] ) ] ]\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasChild ; sh:minCount 1 ] ]\n              ) ]\n            )\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet living situation requirements.\"@en ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # Wohnsitzbedingungen für Nicht-Deutsche\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ] \n            [ sh:and (\n                [ sh:not [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ]\n                [ sh:not [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ]\n            ) ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet residency requirements for non-Germans.\"@en ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # Finanzierungsbedarf\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Can cover personal needs - not eligible.\"@en ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # Förderfähige Berufsausbildung\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:or (\n                # Erste Berufsausbildung\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n                # Oder dauerhaft eingliederungsbedürftig\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ; sh:minCount 1 ] ]\n            ) ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n                sh:in ( ff:CraftsCode ff:NursingProfessionsAct ff:MaritimeLabourAct ff:VocationalTrainingAct ) ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:message \"Training not recognized or not first training without integration needs.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # Vertrag\n        sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingContract ;\n        sh:message \"No vocational training contract.\"@en ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # Auslandsanteil für Ausbildung\n        sh:path ff:monthsAbroad ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:maxInclusive 12 ] \n            [ sh:hasValue 0 ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Training abroad exceeds allowed duration.\"@en ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # Berufsvorbereitung durch Agentur\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Training not commissioned by employment agency.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Ausbildungsgeld' (B100019_LB_574711) based on the given requirements. Let me start by understanding the conditions provided.\n\nFirst, the requirements are:\n\n1. The user must have a disability (Behinderung) and their responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit).\n2. They must be participating in one of the specified measures:\n   - First vocational training,\n   - Vocational preparatory education including basic training,\n   - Individual company qualification within supported employment,\n   - Entry procedure or vocational training area in a workshop for disabled people or another service provider.\n3. They must not have a claim to the transitional allowance (Übergangsgeld).\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to map these requirements to the available properties and classes.\n\nStarting with the first requirement: \"have a disability\" translates to the data property ff:hasDisability which should be true. Also, the rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency, which is the individual ff:FederalEmploymentAgency. The object property ff:hasRehabilitationProvider connects a person to their provider. So, the user must have a hasRehabilitationProvider link to ff:FederalEmploymentAgency and hasDisability must be true.\n\nSecond requirement: participation in specific training measures. The user must be participating in a Training subclass. The listed measures include vocational training, which is ff:VocationalTraining. The entry procedure and vocational training area in a workshop is represented by ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The others might be under ff:Training as well. The property ff:participates links the user to the training. So, the user must have a participates link to an instance of one of these classes. Since SHACL can check the type via sh:class, the shape should require that the object of participates is a member of one of the required subclasses of Training. However, SHACL doesn't directly support OR conditions on class types. Maybe using sh:or with multiple sh:class constraints.\n\nThird requirement: no claim to transitional allowance. The transitional allowance is likely ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (since in the example, that's the Übergangsgeld). The user must not have a hasEligibility for that benefit. So, the user should not have an isEligibleFor link to that benefit. Alternatively, they should not be receiving it. Wait, the exact wording is \"keinen Anspruch\" which is about eligibility. So, the user must not be eligible for Übergangsgeld. So, the shape should check that the user does not have an isEligibleFor link to that benefit.\n\nNow, structuring this into SHACL shapes.\n\nThe target is ff:User, so the shape's targetNode is ff:User.\n\nFirst condition: hasDisability is true.\n\nAdd a property constraint for ff:hasDisability with sh:hasValue true, and sh:minCount 1.\n\nSecond condition: hasRehabilitationProvider is FederalEmploymentAgency. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency;\n]\n\nThird condition: participates in one of the specific trainings. The participates property must have an object that is a subclass of the specified training types. Since SHACL can't directly express OR on classes, perhaps list each possible class and use sh:or. Alternatively, check that the object is an instance of any of the required classes. The required trainings are:\n\n- ff:VocationalTraining (since first vocational training is part of this)\n- ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea (explicitly listed)\n- The others (like vocational preparatory education) might be under ff:Training but not directly specified. Since the problem statement mentions \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\", which might be under another subclass, but the ontology might not have that exact term. Since the ontology's Training subclasses include VocationalTraining and EntryProcedure..., perhaps the others are also under Training. So maybe the participates must be to a Training instance that is either VocationalTraining or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or any of the others mentioned. Since the exact classes for the other measures aren't listed, perhaps we can just check that it's a Training instance, but the problem specifies more specific types. Wait, the problem says \"first vocational training\" which is covered by the first point. The entry procedure is explicitly listed as EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The others might be under VocationalTraining. Alternatively, perhaps the required participation is in any of the listed categories, which in the ontology correspond to certain subclasses. Since the problem might not have all, but at least EntryProcedure is present, maybe the shape requires that the participates target is either a VocationalTraining or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nSo, for the participates property:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VocationalTraining ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ) ];\n    sh:message \"Not participating in required training.\"@en\n]\n\nWait, but the user can be participating in any of those types. The sh:class constraint here would require that the object is an instance of one of those classes. So that should work.\n\nFourth condition: no claim to transitional allowance. The transitional allowance is ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (from the example where it's called Übergangsgeld). So the user must not have an isEligibleFor link to that benefit.\n\nThus, the shape must have a property constraint on ff:isEligibleFor that excludes that benefit. However, in SHACL, to express \"must not have any triples with this predicate and that object\", we can use sh:disjoint.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:property with sh:maxCount 0 and sh:hasValue the benefit.\n\nWait, the exact wording is \"Sie haben keinen Anspruch auf Übergangsgeld.\" So the user must not have an isEligibleFor link to that benefit. Therefore, the constraint is:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor;\n    sh:maxCount 0;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305;\n]\n\nThis would ensure that there are no triples where the user has isEligibleFor that benefit.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- A property for hasDisability must be true.\n\n- hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n- participates must link to a Training that is either VocationalTraining or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\n- isEligibleFor must not include the transitional allowance.\n\nAdditionally, need to define the shape and link it to the benefit.\n\nAlso, need to include the metadata for the benefit itself.\n\nWait, the example had a metadata block for the benefit. So in the SHACL output, we need to declare the benefit's individual.\n\nSo first, the triples for the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training Allowance\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # hasDisability is true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # hasRehabilitationProvider is FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # participates in specified training\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VocationalTraining ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ) ] ;\n        sh:message \"Not participating in required training program.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # must not be eligible for transitional allowance\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n        sh:message \"Eligible for transitional allowance, which is prohibited.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first condition also requires the user has a disability (hasDisability is true). So that's covered by the first property.\n\nCheck the ontology: ff:hasDisability is a data property of ff:Person, so yes.\n\nAlso, the rehabilitation provider is linked via ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which the user must have pointing to ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nThe participates property links to a Training instance, and the object must be of the right subclass.\n\nThe last condition uses sh:maxCount 0 with hasValue to ensure no triples where isEligibleFor points to that benefit.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check again the requirements to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAdditional note: The problem mentions \"erste berufliche Ausbildung\" which is first vocational training. The ontology has ff:isFirstVocationalTraining as a data property on Training. But the example might not require that, since the first part is covered by the type VocationalTraining. Wait, maybe the \"first\" part is part of the requirement. However, in the ontology, the property is on Training: ff:isFirstVocationalTraining. So the user's participates must be to a Training that has that property as true. But the problem states \"erste berufliche Ausbildung\" as one of the options. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nWait the problem says \"Sie werden an einer der folgenden Maßnahmen teilnehmen: (erste) berufliche Ausbildung...\" So the participation can be in a first vocational training, but not necessarily required to be first. The parentheses indicate that \"erste\" is optional here? Or is it part of the requirement that it's the first? The wording in German is \"(erste) berufliche Ausbildung\", which might mean either first or regular vocational training. The parentheses might mean that \"erste\" is an option, but it's unclear. Since the ontology has a property for isFirstVocationalTraining, perhaps the requirement is that the training is the first one. But the problem's wording isn't explicit. Since the problem says \"first vocational training\" is one of the options, but the SHACL might need to check that the training has isFirstVocationalTraining = true if that's required. But without explicit mention, maybe it's not required. Since the problem's exact requirement is ambiguous here, but according to the ontology, if the user is in a VocationalTraining, then that's sufficient unless the \"first\" is required. Since the problem says \"first vocational training\" is part of the options, but the SHACL can't model that unless the data includes that property. Since the user's data must have the isFirstVocationalTraining set if required, but the problem doesn't specify that it's mandatory for all cases. Since the problem says \"erste (first) berufliche Ausbildung\" as one of the options, perhaps the presence of VocationalTraining is sufficient, and the first is just an example. Since I can't be sure, but the ontology includes the property, maybe I should include that the Training must have isFirstVocationalTraining as true? But the problem might not require that. Since the user instruction says not to model ambiguous requirements, perhaps it's safer to exclude that and just require the training type. \n\nSo I'll proceed without that unless it's explicitly required. The problem states the participation must be in one of the listed measures, which include vocational training (whether first or not). So the type VocationalTraining covers that. The entry procedure is another option. So the current constraints are okay.\n\nAnother point: The rehabilitation provider is the FederalEmploymentAgency, so the user must have a hasRehabilitationProvider link to that individual.\n\nThus, the SHACL should be as outlined.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training Allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # The user must have a disability\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # The user's rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # The user must participate in one of the allowed training types\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or ( ff:VocationalTraining ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Not participating in required training program.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # The user must not be eligible for transitional allowance\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ; # Übergangsgeld\n        sh:message \"Eligible for transitional allowance, which is prohibited.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this SHACL validation problem step by step. The task is to create a SHACL graph for the unemployment benefit 'Arbeitslosengeld' with the IDLB B100019_LB_576842 based on the given conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the requirements listed in the text. The user must meet several conditions to be eligible for this benefit. Let me list them out:\n\n1. **Arbeitslosigkeit (Unemployment):**\n   - Not in an employment relationship OR working less than 15 hours per week.\n   - Available for placement efforts of the employment agency (availableForPlacement is true).\n\n2. **Registration:**\n   - Registered unemployed either electronically with eID or in person. This implies that the user must have an employment status of RegisteredUnemployed.\n\n3. **Insurance Requirement:**\n   - Within the last 30 months before unemployment registration, at least 12 months of compulsory insurance. This includes periods like receiving substitute payments (e.g., sick pay) or under specific conditions (like caring for a relative or raising a child). Also, voluntary extended insurance periods (e.g., self-employment) and special cases like development service or work abroad under a secondment contract count.\n\nNow, I need to translate these requirements into SHACL constraints targeting the user node (ff:User).\n\nStarting with the first condition about unemployment status and availability:\n\n- The user must have an employment status of either Unemployed or RegisteredUnemployed. Wait, looking at the ontology, the employment status options include RegisteredUnemployed (which is a type of EmploymentStatus). The condition says \"arbeitslos sind\" which translates to being unemployed. The ontology has ff:Unemployed and ff:RegisteredUnemployed. Since the requirement mentions registration, perhaps the correct status here is ff:RegisteredUnemployed. \n\n- The part about working less than 15 hours per week: The user's employment (if any) must have workHoursPerWeek less than 15. However, if they are not in employment at all, then inEmployment should be false. \n\nAlternatively, the condition states \"Sie stehen nicht in einem Beschäftigungsverhältnis oder Sie üben nur eine Erwerbstätigkeit in einem Umfang von weniger als 15 Stunden wöchentlich aus\". So, either not employed (inEmployment is false) or if employed, workHoursPerWeek <15. \n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? Since SHACL doesn't support OR conditions directly between properties, maybe we can structure it as two separate constraints with sh:or? Wait, the SHACL Core components don't include sh:or, so perhaps we need to use a SPARQL-based constraint.\n\nWait, the rules state to use only SHACL Core components. So maybe break it down into:\n\nEither (a) the user has no employment (so ff:hasEmployment is not present, or the count is 0) OR (b) if they do have an employment, then the workHoursPerWeek must be less than 15. \n\nHmm, but SHACL Core can't handle OR conditions between different properties. Maybe split into two properties:\n\n- The employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed (since the registration is required for the benefit). Wait, the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed might be the key here. Let me check the ontology. \n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\nThe Individual: ff:RegisteredUnemployed is a type of EmploymentStatus, with a comment that the person has officially registered as unemployed. \n\nSo the user's employment status must be ff:RegisteredUnemployed. That might cover the \"arbeitslos sind\" part as well, because being registered as unemployed implies they are unemployed. \n\nAdditionally, the availability part: \"availableForPlacement\" must be true. \n\nSo, for the first condition:\n\n- The user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus with value ff:RegisteredUnemployed.\n\n- The user must have ff:availableForPlacement = true.\n\nThen, the second condition about registration is covered by the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed, perhaps. The registration part is already implied by that status.\n\nNow the third condition: the insurance requirement. The user must have been subject to compulsory insurance for at least 12 months within the last 30 months before registering. \n\nThe ontology has a DataProperty ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 which is a boolean indicating whether this condition is met. So, the user must have ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 = true.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe SHACL shape for the benefit should target ff:User and include the following constraints:\n\n1. Must have an employment status of RegisteredUnemployed.\n2. Must have availableForPlacement = true.\n3. Must have compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 = true.\n\nWait, but the employment status might not be sufficient. The first part of the unemployment condition might also require that if they have employment, it's less than 15 hours. However, if their employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, that might already mean they are not in employment, so maybe that's covered. Let me check the ontology again:\n\nThe ff:RegisteredUnemployed's comment says \"a person has officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\" So being registered unemployed implies that they are not in employment or are working less than 15 hours, as per the definition of unemployment (since the user's status is Unemployed in the ontology requires working less than 15 hours). Wait, looking at the ontology:\n\nThe Individual: ff:Unemployed has a comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\"\n\nAh, so the ff:Unemployed status includes both cases. But the user must be registered as unemployed (RegisteredUnemployed), which is a different status. Wait, perhaps the employment status should be either Unemployed or RegisteredUnemployed?\n\nWait, the ontology's ff:RegisteredUnemployed is a separate EmploymentStatus. Let me check:\n\nThe ontology lists:\n\nIndividual: ff:RegisteredUnemployed\n    Annotations: rdfs:comment \"A person has officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\"@en\n    Types: ff:EmploymentStatus \n\nIndividual: ff:Unemployed \n    Annotations: rdfs:comment \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\"@en\n    Types: ff:EmploymentStatus \n\nSo the user must have employment status of RegisteredUnemployed (to have registered) and also the Unemployed status? Or is the RegisteredUnemployed status sufficient to imply both registration and the unemployment criteria?\n\nThe problem's requirement says that to be unemployed, you must be either not employed or working less than 15 hours. So maybe the ff:Unemployed status already covers that part, and the registration is handled by being RegisteredUnemployed. \n\nBut the user must have both the status of RegisteredUnemployed (for the registration part) and Unemployed (for the employment condition). However, in the ontology, these are separate statuses. This could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the employment status is a single value, so the user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus with RegisteredUnemployed, which might imply the necessary conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have the ff:Unemployed status, and also be registered (RegisteredUnemployed). But I need to check the ontology's definitions.\n\nHmm, maybe the 'arbeitslos sind' part requires the employment status to be Unemployed, and the registration part requires the status to be RegisteredUnemployed. Since a person can't have two employment statuses at the same time, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that the employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, which combines both aspects (being unemployed and registered). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the employment status is a single property, so the user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus exactly one of these. The exact modeling in the ontology might require further analysis, but given the example provided earlier, perhaps the key is to have the employment status as RegisteredUnemployed.\n\nAssuming that the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed covers the registration and the unemployment conditions (since being registered implies they are unemployed as per the benefit's requirements), then the first two conditions are:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus with ff:RegisteredUnemployed\n- ff:availableForPlacement must be true (though maybe that's implied by the employment status? The ontology says ff:Unemployed includes being available, but perhaps availableForPlacement is a separate boolean).\n\nWait the availableForPlacement is a DataProperty: \"True if a person is able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions, false otherwise.\" So even if they have the employment status, they still need to have availableForPlacement = true. So both constraints are necessary.\n\nThe third condition is the insurance requirement: compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 = true.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would have:\n\n- A property constraint on ff:hasEmploymentStatus requiring it to have exactly 1 value, which is ff:RegisteredUnemployed.\n- A property constraint on ff:availableForPlacement requiring it to be true.\n- A property constraint on ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 requiring it to be true.\n\nAdditionally, since the user must have registered (which is part of the employment status), maybe that's all.\n\nNow, checking the ontology's DataProperties:\n\nff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is a DataProperty of the Person, so that's correct.\n\nff:availableForPlacement is also a DataProperty of Person.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would look like:\n\nFor each of these properties:\n\n1. hasEmploymentStatus must have exactly one value of RegisteredUnemployed.\n   So:\n   sh:property [\n       sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus;\n       sh:minCount 1;\n       sh:maxCount 1;\n       sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed;\n       sh:message \"...\";\n   ]\n\n2. availableForPlacement must be true:\n   sh:property [\n       sh:path ff:availableForPlacement;\n       sh:minCount 1;\n       sh:datatype xsd:boolean;\n       sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n       sh:message \"...\";\n   ]\n\nWait, but SHACL uses sh:hasValue for exact matches. Since it's a boolean, the value should be exactly true. So:\n\nsh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean.\n\nWait, maybe better to use sh:hasValue with the boolean literal.\n\n3. compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true, same as above.\n\nPutting this all together in Turtle syntax, with the targetNode as ff:User, and the shape referencing the SocialBenefit individual (ff:B100019_LB_576842).\n\nAlso, the shape should have a name, like ff:ArbeitslosengeldShape or similar.\n\nWait, the example uses the SocialBenefit's ID as part of the shape name. Let's see:\n\nIn the example for 'Einstiegsgeld', the shape was named ff:Einstiegsgeld, which is the German label. The benefit here is 'Arbeitslosengeld' with the IDLB B100019_LB_576842. \n\nThe ontology's individual for Arbeitslosengeld is ff:B100019_LB_576842, which has labels \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de and \"Unemployment benefit\"@en.\n\nSo the shape might be named after the individual's ID or the German label. Following the example's pattern, perhaps the shape is named using the German label, so ff:Arbeitslosengeld.\n\nThe SHACL shape would look like:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\nff:Arbeitslosengeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"Must have employment status RegisteredUnemployed.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must be available for placement.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must have at least 12 months of compulsory insurance in the last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, for boolean properties, using sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean is correct.\n\nAdditionally, the example used sh:checksFundingRequirement but I'm not sure if that's required here. The example might have been specific to their case. Since the task says to target ff:User and model the constraints, perhaps that's all needed.\n\nAnother point: The user must have registered, which is part of the employment status. So the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed should suffice for that part.\n\nTherefore, this should cover all the conditions mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\n# SHACL shape for eligibility validation\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # Always target the user node\n\n    # Requirement: Must have registered as unemployed (employment status)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;  # Employment status must be registered unemployed\n        sh:message \"User must be registered as unemployed (ff:RegisteredUnemployed).\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Requirement: Available for placement efforts\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # Must be true\n        sh:message \"User must be available for employment agency placement (ff:availableForPlacement=true).\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Requirement: 12 months compulsory insurance within 30 months\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # Must be true\n        sh:message \"Must have at least 12 months of compulsory insurance in the last 30 months (ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30=true).\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit described here. Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the TEXT. The benefit is \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102717659. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of developing one.\n2. Their rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\n3. Their prospects of participating in the workforce are significantly and permanently reduced due to the disability's nature and severity, necessitating support for integration.\n4. They must be willing to undergo vocational training or similar integration.\n\nFirst, I'll check the ontology to map these conditions to existing classes and properties.\n\nFor the first condition: \"hochgradige Seh oder Hörbehinderung\" translates to severe visual (ff:VisualImpairment) or hearing (ff:HearingImpairment) disability. The user must either have this disability (ff:hasDisabilityType) or be at risk (ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType). The disability must be severe (severeDisability true) and permanently reduce work prospects (reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true).\n\nThe second condition requires the rehabilitation provider (ff:hasRehabilitationProvider) to be ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nThird condition: The disability must be the reason for the reduced work prospects. The user must have a workforceIntegrationProblemBecause link to the disability. Also, the reduction must not be temporary, so the disability's effect is permanent.\n\nFourth condition: The user must be willing to undergo training. Maybe this is captured by ff:participates in a training program? Or perhaps a boolean like ff:availableForPlacement? Wait, looking at the ontology, there's ff:availableForPlacement which indicates if they are able and willing to work. That might fit here. Alternatively, maybe it's part of their intent to participate in a program. Let me check the ontology again. The ff:participates property links a person to a training they are currently in. But the requirement is about willingness, so perhaps the availableForPlacement data property is better here. The description says \"availableForPlacement is true if a person is able and willing to work...\", which aligns with the requirement.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"bereit sein, sich beruflich bilden oder auf andere Weise beruflich eingliedern zu lassen.\" So it's about being willing to undergo training or similar. The availableForPlacement is defined as \"able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions.\" Hmm, maybe that's not exactly the same. Alternatively, maybe there's another property. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a participation in a training (ff:participates) but the requirement is more about willingness rather than current participation. Since the example uses inversePath for the workforceIntegrationProblemBecause, perhaps the fourth condition is captured by a separate shape. Alternatively, maybe the availableForPlacement should be true here. Let me see the ontology again for DataProperties. There is ff:availableForPlacement (boolean), which seems to fit as willingness to work. So setting that to true would satisfy the condition.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe SHACL shape should target ff:User. The conditions are:\n\n- OR (hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType) with the disability being either Visual or Hearing, severe, and reducing work prospects permanently. Also, the disability must be the cause of the workforce integration problem (via inversePath).\n\n- The rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n- availableForPlacement must be true.\n\nWait, the third condition mentions that the user needs support because of their disability. The example used an inversePath for workforceIntegrationProblemBecause. The property ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause points from the person to the disability that causes the need for integration help. So the user must have at least one such link where the target is their disability. So in SHACL, the shape for the disability would have an inverse path to the user.\n\nLet me structure the SHACL step by step.\n\nFirst, define the NodeShape for the benefit. The target is ff:User.\n\nFor the first condition (disability or at risk):\n\nUse sh:or with two paths: hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType. Each must have at least one value that satisfies the disability shape (severe, reducesWorkProspectsPermanently, and of the right type).\n\nThe DisabilityShape will enforce that the disability is either VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, has severeDisability true, reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true, and that the user's workforceIntegrationProblemBecause links to this disability.\n\nWait, how to express that the disability is the reason for the workforce integration problem. The user has a property ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause pointing to the disability. So in the DisabilityShape, perhaps we can require that the disability is linked via inversePath from the user's workforceIntegrationProblemBecause. Alternatively, in the main shape, after ensuring the existence of the disability, we can have another condition that the user has a workforceIntegrationProblemBecause link to that disability.\n\nAlternatively, in the DisabilityShape, the inverse path would check that the user is connected to this disability as the cause of their integration problem. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, in the main shape, after ensuring that the user has the disability (via the OR clause), the DisabilityShape would also enforce that the disability has the necessary properties (type, severe, reducesWorkProspectsPermanently), and that the user's workforceIntegrationProblemBecause includes this disability.\n\nWait, perhaps in the main shape, the OR clause for the disability types will have a qualifiedValueShape that includes the DisabilityShape, which in turn ensures that the disability has the required properties and that the user links to it via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause.\n\nWait, the qualifiedValueShape for the disability in the OR would apply the DisabilityShape to the target of hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType. So each such disability instance must satisfy the DisabilityShape's constraints. The DisabilityShape would include:\n\n- The disability must be a type of Visual or Hearing.\n\n- The disability must have severeDisability true.\n\n- The disability must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have a workforceIntegrationProblemBecause link to this disability. How to express that in the DisabilityShape?\n\nThe DisabilityShape's NodeShape can have a property that requires that the disability is linked via inversePath of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause to the user. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:in (ff:User);\n]\n\nThis would mean that the disability is the object of a ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause from the User, which is correct.\n\nThen, for the second condition: hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency. So a property shape on ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, requiring it to be in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency).\n\nThird condition: availableForPlacement must be true. So a data property shape on ff:availableForPlacement with sh:hasValue true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main shape (ff:GrundausbildungShape) will have:\n\n- The OR clause for disabilities.\n\n- The rehabilitation provider property.\n\n- The availableForPlacement property.\n\nThe DisabilityShape will handle the type, severity, and the inverse link.\n\nWait, but the availableForPlacement is a data property of the user, so in the main shape, that's straightforward:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue true;\n]\n\nNow checking all conditions:\n\n1. The first condition is covered by the OR and the DisabilityShape.\n\n2. Rehabilitation provider is covered by the property shape.\n\n3. The third condition's part about needing help is handled by the DisabilityShape's inversePath.\n\n4. The willingness is via availableForPlacement.\n\nThat should cover all four requirements. Now let me check if all the ontology terms are correctly used.\n\nff:hasRehabilitationProvider's range is ff:RehabilitationProvider, and FederalEmploymentAgency is an instance of that, so that's correct.\n\nThe availableForPlacement is a data property of the user, yes.\n\nSo the SHACL should look like this:\n\nPrefixes as in the example.\n\nThe shape for the benefit, targetNode is ff:User.\n\nOR condition between hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType, each with qualifiedValueShape being DisabilityShape.\n\nThen the properties for rehabilitation provider, availableForPlacement, and the DisabilityShape's constraints.\n\nThe example also had a check for the rehabilitation provider's in clause and messages, so including those.\n\nAdditionally, the Benefit's metadata is included with labels.\n\nI think that's it. Let me write this in Turtle syntax.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102717659 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\"@de, \"Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Disability condition (has or at risk of severe visual/hearing impairment)\n        sh:or (\n            [ \n                sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape \n            ]\n            [\n                sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape \n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    # Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be Bundesagentur für Arbeit\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Must be willing to participate in workforce integration (availableForPlacement)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Must be willing to participate in workforce integration\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:DisabilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Disability must be visual or hearing impairment\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Disability must be severe\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must permanently reduce work prospects\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    # Disability must be the reason for workforce integration needs\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The task is to generate a SHACL graph for the 'Insolvenzgeld' benefit with IDLB B100019_LB_576848 based on the given conditions. The user provided an example for a similar benefit, which I should reference to structure my solution correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the requirements listed in the TEXT:\n\n1. **Insolvency Event Occurred**:\n   - The employer has either:\n     a. A bankruptcy proceeding opened against their assets.\n     b. An insolvency application rejected due to lack of assets.\n     c. The business activity completely ceased with obvious lack of assets.\n\n2. **Wage Cut Before Event**:\n   - The user didn't receive wages for up to 3 months before the insolvency event.\n\n3. **Employment Location**:\n   - Employed in Germany, or temporarily abroad while still under German social security.\n\n4. **Legal Employee Status**:\n   - Must be legally recognized as an employee (e.g., if they're a managing partner, shareholder, or related to the employer, they still need to prove employee status via a ruling).\n\nAdditionally, the example uses NodeShapes for different conditions and PropertyShapes for constraints like wage cut duration and country checks. \n\nStarting with the SHACL structure:\n- Define the SocialBenefit individual with the correct ID and labels.\n- Create a main NodeShape targeting ff:User.\n- Break down each requirement into separate shapes where necessary.\n\n**1. Insolvency Event Shapes**:\nThe three scenarios (a, b, c) need separate NodeShapes. Each must check the employer's event type and relevant properties. \n\nFor ShapeA (Bankruptcy Proceeding):\n- The event must be an InsolvencyProceeding.\n- The proceeding must still be open (isOpen=true).\n\nShapeB (Rejected Application):\n- Event is InsolvencyApplication.\n- rejectedForLackOfAssets=true.\n\nShapeC (Business Discontinuation with no assets):\n- Event is DiscontinuationOfBusiness.\n- obviousLackOfAssets=true on the employer.\n\nAll three require the WageCutShape for the 3-month wage cut before the event.\n\n**2. Wage Cut Constraint**:\nThe WageCutShape checks the wageCutOffsetMonths. The wage wasn't paid for up to 3 months before the event. The offset should be between -3 and -1 (since negative means before the event). Using sh:minInclusive and sh:maxInclusive here.\n\n**3. Employment Location**:\nTwo options:\n- Employed in Germany (countryOfEmployment is Germany).\n- Abroad but socialSecurityCountry is Germany.\n\nThese are OR conditions, so two separate NodeShapes (CountryShapeA and CountryShapeB) under sh:or in the main shape.\n\n**4. Employment Status**:\nUser must have EmploymentStatus as Employee. This is a straightforward property constraint with sh:in (ff:Employee).\n\n**Additional Considerations**:\n- All paths should correctly traverse the ontology. For example, employer's events are via hasEmployment/employer/hasEvent.\n- Ensure all required paths have sh:minCount 1 where necessary to enforce existence.\n- Messages should be in English as per the example.\n\nNow, translating these into Turtle syntax following the example's structure. Make sure to use SHACL Core components only, avoid extra terms, and validate syntax.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main shape for Insolvenzgeld eligibility\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Insolvency event occurred at employer\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeB\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeC\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency event occurred at employer'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: Wage cut within 3 months before event\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n        sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Wage cut within 3 months before event'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        # Requirement 3: Employment location (Germany or abroad with German social security)\n        ff:EmploymentLocationShapeA\n        ff:EmploymentLocationShapeB\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 4: Legal employee status\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Employee) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Legal employee status'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# Insolvency event scenarios\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeC a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:obviousLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\n# Employment location constraints\nff:EmploymentLocationShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:EmploymentLocationShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:not [ sh:in (ff:Germany) ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe benefit is for people who can't cover their basic needs from income and assets, and they must meet one of three conditions:\n\n1. They've reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII (ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true).\n2. They're 18+ and permanently fully work-reduced (ff:hasAge ≥18, ff:hasDisability is true, and the disability reduces work prospects permanently).\n3. They're 18+ and in a specific training program (ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) either completing the entry procedure/education or in a training relationship with a budget.\n\nAdditionally, social assistance is a priority benefit, so they must have no priority claims over this benefit (ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver for this benefit should be present?), and they must pursue claims against third parties like alimony first. But since the user can't cover basic needs despite that, maybe that's a data property check? Wait, the ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links a person to a benefit if they don't have priority claims. So maybe the user must not have any such claims over this benefit? Or does the shape need to ensure they don't have other priority benefits?\n\nHmm, the user must have no priority claims over this benefit, so the user must have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to this benefit. Or perhaps the absence of such claims is required. Wait, the description says \"Ansprüche gegen Dritte ... sind vorrangig zu verfolgen.\" So the person must have pursued those claims, and if they aren't fulfilled, then the social benefit can be claimed. But modeling that might be tricky. The SHACL might need to check that they aren't eligible for higher-priority benefits (like other social benefits with higher priority), so maybe they have to have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver set for this benefit. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be receiving other priority benefits. But according to the ontology, ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver has a domain of Person and range SocialBenefit. So perhaps the user must have a triple where they have this property pointing to the current benefit, indicating they have no prior claims over it. \n\nAlso, the benefit is a priority-eligible one, so maybe the user must not have other benefits that take priority. Alternatively, the SHACL needs to ensure that the user has no other benefits that are higher priority. Since the examples used hasValue for required properties, maybe here the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the current benefit as the object. Let me check the ontology's definition of ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver: \"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So the user should have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to this benefit. Therefore, the SHACL should require that the user has that property with the current benefit as the value. \n\nNow, the main conditions:\n\nFirst condition: aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true. So the user must have ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit true.\n\nSecond condition: hasAge ≥18, hasDisability true, and the disability reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true). Wait, the disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must be true. But how to model that? The user has a disability (ff:hasDisabilityType or ff:hasDisability is true?), but the exact property for the disability's effect. The ontology has ff:hasDisability (boolean data property), but also the disability instances might have ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently. Since the user's disability must have that property, maybe we need to check that the user has a disability (ff:hasDisability is true) and that the disability (through the object property) has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently set to true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a disability (ff:hasDisability true) and that the disability is of a type that reduces work prospects permanently. But the ontology's ff:Disability class has the reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as a data property. So the user's disability (through hasDisabilityType?) must have that property set to true. Wait, the object property ff:hasDisabilityType links a person to a Disability instance, so the Disability instance must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. Therefore, the SHACL would need to ensure that there exists a disability (via hasDisabilityType) where that property is true. \n\nBut SHACL can't directly traverse object properties to check data properties of the target. So maybe it's easier to use the ff:hasDisability (boolean) and also require that the user has a disability that meets the condition. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the user has hasDisability true and also has a disability that reduces work prospects permanently. But how to express that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't do joins, perhaps we need to model this as two separate conditions: ff:hasDisability is true and also the user has a disability type (via hasDisabilityType) where that type's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true. But that might not be feasible because SHACL can't traverse the object property and check the data property. Maybe the data property ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is on the person's disability. Alternatively, perhaps the user's ff:hasDisability is true, and the user's EarningCapacity is reduced (but not sure). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second condition requires that the person's earning capacity is permanently reduced. The ontology has ff:EarningCapacity instances like ReducedEarningCapacity or UnfitForWork. The user's hasEarningCapacity must point to an instance where the reduction is permanent. For example, if the user has an EarningCapacity that is of type UnfitForWork, which would have ff:isPermanent true? Or maybe the EarningCapacity has ff:isPermanent true. \n\nWait the user has a hasEarningCapacity property pointing to an EarningCapacity instance, which might have certain data properties. So to check if the user is permanently work-reduced, maybe the EarningCapacity has ff:isPermanent and ff:reductionInPercent is 100%? Not sure. Alternatively, the condition states \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI\". The ontology's ff:UnfitForWork is an EarningCapacity type. So maybe the user's hasEarningCapacity is ff:UnfitForWork. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have ff:hasDisability true and the disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. But without being able to traverse, maybe the data property on the disability is not directly accessible. This is a problem. Maybe the ontology's ff:hasDisability is a boolean that indicates whether any disability exists, and another property for the severity or impact. Wait, looking at the ontology's data properties: there's ff:hasDisability (boolean), and also for Disability instances, there's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently (boolean). But how to model that the user has a disability that has that property. \n\nHmm, this might not be possible with SHACL's current constraints. Since SHACL can't do nested property checks beyond the subject, perhaps the example in the problem uses the ff:hasDisability boolean and another condition on the disability's impact. Maybe the user must have hasDisability true and also has a disability type (via hasDisabilityType) that has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. But again, SHACL can't check that. Therefore, maybe the problem expects to model the second condition as the user's earning capacity is permanently reduced to 100% (unfit for work). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second condition's \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert\" is captured by the ff:UnfitForWork instance of EarningCapacity. So the user must have ff:hasEarningCapacity with ff:UnfitForWork. \n\nThe third condition requires the user is 18+ (ff:hasAge ≥18) and is in a specific training (ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) either completing the entry procedure or in a training relationship with an education budget. The user must be participating in such a training (ff:participates points to the training instance, which must be of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and perhaps has a TrainingBudget (ff:hasRehabilitationProvider? Or ff:subjectToContract with VocationalTrainingContract?). The ontology's EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training. So the user's participates must point to a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. Additionally, they must have a TrainingBudget (maybe ff:hasRehabilitationProvider pointing to TrainingBudget?), but I'm not sure. The description says \"durchlaufen oder in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\" So the training must be funded by a budget. The Training instance must have a ff:subjectToContract (VocationalTrainingContract?) or perhaps ff:triggeringEvent (not sure). Alternatively, the training must have ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true? The ontology's ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a data property on Training, which might indicate that the training is funded. \n\nAlternatively, the Training instance must have a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider set to TrainingBudget. Since TrainingBudget is an individual of SocialBenefit, perhaps the rehabilitation provider is the one providing the budget. So the user's training must have ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ff:TrainingBudget. \n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL needs to have three alternative conditions (one of the three scenarios must be true), plus the priority claims condition, and the inability to cover basic needs. \n\nThe inability to cover basic needs is probably captured by ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. The user must have ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit false. \n\nSo the main properties to check are:\n\n1. Either:\n   a. ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true\n   b. (ff:hasAge >=18) AND (ff:hasEarningCapacity is ff:UnfitForWork) \n   c. (ff:hasAge >=18) AND (participates in a Training of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true or similar)\n\n2. ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false\n\n3. ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver includes this benefit (so the user has a triple where they have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to this benefit's ID).\n\nWait, the benefit's ID is ff:L100040_LB_8664880. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, the benefit's IDLB is L100040_LB_8664880. So the shape should target the user and validate against this benefit's requirements. \n\nSo the SHACL shape will have a targetNode ff:User and the conditions.\n\nFirst, the three OR conditions:\n\nThe SHACL must use sh:or to group these conditions. \n\nFor condition 1a: the user must have ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit true.\n\nCondition 1b: age >=18 (ff:hasAge >=18) and the earning capacity is UnfitForWork. Wait, UnfitForWork is an instance of EarningCapacity. So the user's hasEarningCapacity must point to UnfitForWork. \n\nAlternatively, the ff:hasEarningCapacity property should have a value of UnfitForWork (since that's an individual). \n\nSo for the second part of condition 1b: \n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork;\n]\n\nCondition 1c: \n\nThe user must have ff:participates pointing to a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and that Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true, or something similar. \n\nBut in SHACL, to check that the participates target is of a certain type, you can use sh:class. However, since the ontology defines EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea as a subclass, the Training must be an instance of that. \n\nSo for the participates property, the path would be ff:participates, and the node must be of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. \n\nAdditionally, the training must have been commissioned (commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true). \n\nTherefore, the condition for 1c would require:\n\n- The user has a participates link to a Training (ff:participates) which is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and that Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nTo model this in SHACL, using sh:property and sh:node and sh:and. \n\nWait, SHACL can do this with sh:property and then within that, sh:node with sh:shape. For example:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:node [\n        sh:and (\n            [sh:property [sh:path rdf:type; sh:hasValue ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea]] \n            [sh:property [sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency; sh:hasValue true]]\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nThis would ensure that the participates target is of that type and has the data property set. \n\nAdditionally, the user must be 18 or older: ff:hasAge >=18.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- A sh:or with three components (for the three main conditions)\n\nEach component is a sh:and (since the conditions have multiple parts):\n\nFor condition 1a:\n\nsh:and ( \n    [sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit; sh:hasValue true]\n)\n\nFor condition 1b:\n\nsh:and (\n    [sh:path ff:hasAge; sh:>= \"18\"^^xsd:int],\n    [sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity; sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork]\n)\n\nFor condition 1c:\n\nsh:and (\n    [sh:path ff:hasAge; sh:>= \"18\"^^xsd:int],\n    [sh:path ff:participates; sh:minCount 1; sh:node [ \n        sh:and (\n            [sh:property [sh:path rdf:type; sh:hasValue ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea]],\n            [sh:property [sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency; sh:hasValue true]]\n        )\n    ]]\n)\n\nThen, the other required conditions:\n\n- canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false: \n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit;\n    sh:hasValue false\n]\n\n- hasNoPriorityClaimsOver includes the current benefit (L100040_LB_8664880). So the user must have a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to this benefit. \n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880\n]\n\nPutting all together in the SHACL:\n\nThe shape for the benefit L100040_LB_8664880 would be:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:L100040_LB_8664880 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung\"@de, \"Basic security in old age and with reduced earning capacity\"@en .\n\nff:Grundsicherung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:message \"User must be a Person.\"@en\n    ] ;  # Just to ensure it's a Person, but maybe redundant\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880;\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over this benefit.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit;\n        sh:hasValue false;\n        sh:message \"User must not be able to cover basic needs.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit;\n                sh:hasValue true;\n            ]\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasAge;\n                    sh:>= \"18\"^^xsd:int\n                ]\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasAge;\n                    sh:>= \"18\"^^xsd:int\n                ]\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:participates;\n                    sh:minCount 1;\n                    sh:node [\n                        sh:and (\n                            [\n                                sh:property [\n                                    sh:path rdf:type;\n                                    sh:hasValue ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n                                ]\n                            ]\n                            [\n                                sh:property [\n                                    sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n                                    sh:hasValue true\n                                ]\n                            ]\n                        )\n                    ]\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n    ;\n    sh:message \"User must meet one of the eligibility conditions.\"@en .\n}\n\nWait, I need to make sure all the parts are correctly structured. Also, the node shapes should be properly defined. Also, the name of the shape should be something like ff:Grundsicherung_Eligibility or similar. Let me adjust the shape name and structure properly.\n\nAlso, the commissioning might be the key part for the training. The problem states the training must be receiving a budget, which in the ontology might be indicated by ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency (since the employment agency commissions it). The ontology's ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a boolean data property on Training.\n\nSo the third condition's participates node must have that property set to true.\n\nAnother possible point: the third condition says \"durchlaufen oder in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\" So either they are in the process of completing the training or are in a training relationship with a budget. The ff:participates points to a training they are currently in, so that's covered by the participates having the training commissioned.\n\nI think this covers all the conditions. Now I need to write this in Turtle syntax correctly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit node\nff:L100040_LB_8664880 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung\"@de, \"Basic security in old age and with reduced earning capacity\"@en .\n\n# Define the SHACL shape for eligibility\nff:Grundsicherung_Eligibility a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Must have no priority claims over this benefit\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over this benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Must be unable to cover basic needs\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must not be able to cover basic needs of benefit unit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # One of the three conditions must be met\n    sh:or (\n        # Condition 1: Age limit reached\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ]\n        ]\n        \n        # Condition 2: 18+ with permanent full earning capacity reduction\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:>= \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ;\n                [ sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ; sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ]\n            )\n        ]\n        \n        # Condition 3: 18+ in approved training program\n        [\n            sh:and (\n                [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:>= \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ;\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:participates ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:node [\n                        sh:and (\n                            # Must be correct training type\n                            [ sh:property [ sh:path rdf:type ; sh:hasValue ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] ] ;\n                            \n                            # Must be commissioned by employment agency\n                            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n                        )\n                    ]\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    \n    sh:message \"User must meet one of the eligibility criteria.\"@en .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit described here. The benefit is 'Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung' with IDLB B100019_LB_103817036. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nFirst, the user must be legally health-insured along with the person they're accompanying. The ontology has ff:hasInsurance which links a person to an insurance. The insurance here should be StatutoryHealthInsurance (ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance). So I need to check that the user has this insurance. Also, the accompanied person must have it too. Wait, but how is the accompanied person represented in the RDF data? The ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold, but maybe the user is linked to the person they're accompanying through another property. Hmm, maybe through ff:immediateCircleMember or ff:closeRelative? The requirement says the user is a close relative or part of the immediate circle. Let me check the properties. There's ff:closeRelative and ff:immediateCircleMember. The user must be linked to the person they're accompanying via one of these. So, the user must have at least one closeRelative or immediateCircleMember who is the person needing care.\n\nNext, the person being accompanied must be in inpatient treatment. The ontology has ff:MedicalAccompaniment as a subclass of Event. The requirement mentions that the inpatient admission is medically necessary and includes full-day accompaniment (over 8 hours including travel). The property ff:fullDayAccompaniment on MedicalAccompaniment should be true. Also, the accompanied person needs to have a disability. Since the benefit is for accompanying a disabled person, the person must have a disability (ff:hasDisability true) or maybe a specific type like ff:hasDisabilityType.\n\nThe user must have a loss of earnings. The ontology has ff:causesLossOfEarnings on Event. But the user's event (maybe an employment loss?) should have this property as true. Alternatively, the user's employment status might indicate that. Wait, the requirement states \"Sie haben einen Verdienstausfall.\" which translates to \"You have a loss of income.\" So perhaps the user's EarningCapacity has some property indicating reduced capacity, but maybe better to look for an event linked via ff:triggeringEvent where ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true. Alternatively, maybe the user's employment has been affected. Alternatively, the user's income has a reduction? Need to see the ontology again. The DataProperty ff:causesLossOfEarnings is on Event, so the user must have an event (maybe the same as the MedicalAccompaniment event?) that has this property set to true.\n\nThe accompanied person must receive Integration Assistance (Eingliederungshilfe). The ontology has ff:IntegrationAssistance as a SocialBenefit. So the person being accompanied must have ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor linked to ff:IntegrationAssistance. Wait, the requirement says the accompanied person is receiving Integration Assistance. So the user's accompanied person must have ff:receivesBenefit(ff:IntegrationAssistance).\n\nThe user cannot be receiving payment for the accompaniment. The text says if they get paid, they can't get the benefit. So the user's event (the accompaniment) must not be renumerated. The ontology has ff:isRenumerated on Event. So the MedicalAccompaniment event's ff:isRenumerated must be false.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape must target ff:User and include these constraints.\n\nFirst, the user must have ff:hasInsurance with StatutoryHealthInsurance. So:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:hasInsurance; sh:minCount 1; sh:class ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance; ]\n\nWait, but the user must have that insurance. So maybe:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n]\n\nWait no, because ff:hasInsurance is an object property to an Insurance instance. Wait, ff:hasInsurance is an object property where the range is ff:Insurance. The insurance instance must be of type ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance. So the user must have at least one Insurance that is an instance of StatutoryHealthInsurance. So the SHACL constraint would check that the user has an Insurance that is a StatutoryHealthInsurance. To do that, using sh:class:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:class ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n]\n\nAdditionally, the accompanied person (linked via closeRelative or immediateCircle) must also have ff:hasInsurance with StatutoryHealthInsurance. But how to express that? Hmm, maybe the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember who has that insurance. Wait, but SHACL can't traverse two hops in a single constraint. Alternatively, the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, and that person must have the insurance. But that's complex. Maybe the requirement is that both the user and the accompanied person have the insurance. But how to represent that in SHACL? Alternatively, the requirement says \"Sie und die von Ihnen begleitete Person mit Behinderung sind gesetzlich krankenversichert.\" So both must have statutory health insurance. The user's own insurance is covered by the first constraint. The accompanied person's insurance must also be there, but how to model that? Maybe the user must have a property (like ff:caregiverInHousehold or another) pointing to the person needing care, and that person must have the insurance. But looking at the ontology, the ff:caregiverInHousehold is from CareNeed to Person (caregiver). The accompanied person is the one needing care, so perhaps the user is the caregiver. Wait, the MedicalAccompaniment is an Event, and the person needing care is linked via ff:caregiverInHousehold? Maybe not. Alternatively, the accompanied person is linked via ff:caregiverInHousehold in reverse? Hmm, maybe the user is the caregiver, so the CareNeed has ff:caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user. Wait, the domain of ff:caregiverInHousehold is CareNeed, so CareNeed → caregiver (user). The person needing care would be the subject of the CareNeed. But how to get to that person? Maybe through another property. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember who is the person with disability, and that person must have the insurance.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the requirement that both the user and the accompanied person have statutory health insurance can be split into two parts: the user's own insurance is checked via hasInsurance, and the accompanied person (linked via closeRelative or immediateCircle) also has the insurance. But in SHACL, I can't directly check the linked person's properties. Unless we model the accompanied person as an object, but the SHACL shape is only on the User node. Maybe the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember who is linked via those properties and that person must have the insurance. But SHACL can't traverse that in a single property constraint. So perhaps the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, and the user's MedicalAccompaniment event must involve that person, and that person has the insurance. This might require using sh:property with nested constraints, but SHACL core doesn't support that. Maybe the best approach is to focus on the user's own insurance, and assume the other checks are handled elsewhere, but the problem states to model only what can be clearly assessed. Since the accompanied person's insurance is a requirement, but I can't model it directly, perhaps it's better to omit it as ambiguous? Wait the user and the accompanied person must both be insured. Since I can't express the accompanied person's insurance, maybe this requirement can't be modeled and thus must be excluded. But the problem says to not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user's closeRelative/immediateCircle member must have the insurance, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the MedicalAccompaniment event is linked to the accompanied person via some property? Like ff:caregiverInHousehold? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user's MedicalAccompaniment event has a property linking to the accompanied person, but I don't see such a property in the ontology. Looking through the ontology properties:\n\nLooking at ff:MedicalAccompaniment is a subclass of Event. The ff:caregiverInHousehold is from CareNeed to Person (caregiver). Maybe the MedicalAccompaniment is a type of CareNeed? No, MedicalAccompaniment is a subclass of Event. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to proceed with the parts I can model.\n\nNext requirement: The inpatient admission as caregiver is medically necessary and full-day. The MedicalAccompaniment event (which is the event in question) must have ff:fullDayAccompaniment true and ff:inPatientCoAdmission true. Wait, the ontology has ff:inPatientCoAdmission as a DataProperty on MedicalAccompaniment. The description says \"True if a person is admitted as accompanying person for inpatient treatment, false otherwise.\" So that must be true. Also, the fullDayAccompaniment is required, so that must be true as well.\n\nSo, the user must have a MedicalAccompaniment event where both ff:inPatientCoAdmission and ff:fullDayAccompaniment are true. How to represent this in SHACL? The user must have an event that is a MedicalAccompaniment and has those properties. So:\n\nThe user has an event of type MedicalAccompaniment with those properties. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n]\n\nWait, but the user has ff:hasEvent? The ontology says ff:hasEvent is an object property from Employer or Person to Event. So the user (as a Person) can have ff:hasEvent. So the user must have an event which is a MedicalAccompaniment, and that event must have both inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment as true. So the above constraint would work.\n\nNext, the user must have a loss of earnings. The requirement says the event (the accompaniment) causes a loss of earnings. The event (MedicalAccompaniment) must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings true. So the same event must also have that. So adding to the qualifiedValueShape:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n  sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\nSo the MedicalAccompaniment event must have inPatientCoAdmission true, fullDayAccompaniment true, and causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nThen, the user must be a close relative or immediate circle member of the accompanied person. The user must have at least one closeRelative or immediateCircleMember. Wait, but the accompanied person is the one needing care. The user must be linked to that person via one of those properties. So the user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n]\n\nThis ensures that the user has at least one close relative or immediate circle member. But this is a bit broad, because it could be any such person, but the requirement is specifically about the accompanied person. However, since we can't link it directly to the event's person, maybe this is the best we can do. The requirement says the user must be a close relative or part of the immediate circle of the person being accompanied, so the existence of such a relationship is necessary. So this constraint is acceptable.\n\nThe accompanied person must receive Integration Assistance. Again, this would require that the accompanied person (the one being accompanied) has ff:receivesBenefit(ff:IntegrationAssistance). But how to model that in SHACL? Since we can't traverse to the accompanied person's data, this might not be possible. The user's data might not have that information, so this requirement might be ambiguous and thus excluded. The problem states not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. So maybe this part is omitted.\n\nThe last requirement: if the user is being paid for the accompaniment, they can't get the benefit. The event (MedicalAccompaniment) must have ff:isRenumerated false. So adding:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:isRenumerated ;\n  sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\nSo in the qualifiedValueShape for the MedicalAccompaniment event, add this.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe shape for the benefit would target ff:User, and include these constraints.\n\nAdditionally, the MedicalAccompaniment must be the event in question, so the user must have such an event with all those properties.\n\nAlso, the accompanied person must have a disability. The requirement says \"Menschen mit Behinderung\" (people with disabilities). So the accompanied person must have ff:hasDisability true. Again, since we can't directly check the accompanied person's data, maybe this is omitted as ambiguous. Alternatively, the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircle member who has a disability. So:\n\nThe user has a closeRelative or immediateCircle member with ff:hasDisability true.\n\nTo model that, the user must have at least one closeRelative or immediateCircle member who has the hasDisability property as true. In SHACL, this would be a path constraint:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:closeRelative / ff:hasDisability,\n         ff:immediateCircleMember / ff:hasDisability ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\nWait, but SHACL's path can use inverse properties? Or can it chain properties. The path ff:closeRelative followed by ff:hasDisability. So the user has a closeRelative (Person) who has ff:hasDisability true. So this would require that the user has a close relative with that property. This is possible.\n\nSo adding this constraint.\n\nNow compiling all the constraints:\n\nThe SHACL shape will have:\n\n- Must have statutory health insurance.\n- Must have a closeRelative or immediateCircle member with hasDisability true.\n- Must be linked to a MedicalAccompaniment event with inPatientCoAdmission true, fullDayAccompaniment true, causesLossOfEarnings true, and isRenumerated false.\n- Must have a closeRelative or immediateCircle member (already covered by the previous constraint).\n- The accompanied person's insurance and Integration Assistance are not modeled due to lack of ontology linkage.\n\nWait but the user's own insurance is covered. The accompanied person's insurance is not checkable here, so we can't model that part. So we exclude that requirement as ambiguous.\n\nThe Integration Assistance requirement is also about the accompanied person, so that's also excluded.\n\nSo the final SHACL would have the following constraints:\n\n1. Has statutory health insurance:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:class ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n]\n\n2. CloseRelative or immediateCircle member has disability:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:closeRelative / ff:hasDisability,\n         ff:immediateCircleMember / ff:hasDisability ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\n3. Has MedicalAccompaniment event with required properties:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isRenumerated ;\n      sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n]\n\nAdditionally, the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircle member. Wait, the second constraint already checks that at least one of those has disability, which implies they exist. So maybe that's covered.\n\nPutting all together in Turtle syntax:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_103817036 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de, \"Sickness benefit for caregiver during inpatient treatment of disabled person\"@en .\n\nff:B100019_LB_103817036_Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Statutory health insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory health insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: Close relative or immediate circle member has disability\n        sh:path ff:closeRelative / ff:hasDisability,\n             ff:immediateCircleMember / ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a close relative or immediate circle member with disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 3: Medical Accompaniment event with required properties\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isRenumerated ;\n                sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:message \"Medical accompaniment event must meet all conditions.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the messages should be in German as per the example? The example had German labels. Let me check the example provided:\n\nIn the example, the SHACL had:\n\nsh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n\nSo perhaps messages are in both languages, but the problem doesn't specify. I'll include both German and English messages where possible.\n\nWait the MedicalAccompaniment's qualifiedValueShape's message can be added to each property, but maybe it's better to have a general message for the event.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that all the properties are correctly spelled according to the ontology.\n\nCheck the ontology for ff:inPatientCoAdmission and ff:fullDayAccompaniment:\n\n- ff:inPatientCoAdmission is a DataProperty on MedicalAccompaniment, yes.\n- ff:fullDayAccompaniment is also on MedicalAccompaniment.\n\nYes.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have a close relative or immediate circle member. The second constraint checks that they have at least one such person with disability, so that covers existence.\n\nThe user must have the MedicalAccompaniment event with all those properties.\n\nI think that's all the requirements that can be modeled. The others (insurance and Integration Assistance for the accompanied person) are omitted as they can't be clearly assessed via the user's data.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_103817036 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de, \"Sickness benefit for caregiver during inpatient treatment of disabled person\"@en .\n\n# Shape for eligibility requirements\nff:B100019_LB_103817036_Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # 1.
