        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the eligibility of the 'Einstiegsgeld' (B100019_LB_102713860) based on the provided conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must have been receiving Bürgergeld before starting the new activity. The Bürgergeld is another social benefit, so I'll check if the user has received it. The ontology has a property 'receivedBenefit' which links a person to a SocialBenefit they've received. The Bürgergeld is represented by the individual B100019_LB_106311931. So, the user must have received that benefit before starting the new job. I'll use a sh:hasValue constraint on the receivedBenefit to check for that individual.\n\nNext, the application must be submitted before starting the new employment. The ontology includes a Training or Employment class? Wait, the new activity could be employment or self-employment. The user has to apply before the actual start. The ontology has 'participates' which links a person to a Training, but maybe Employment has a start date. The ontology doesn't have a direct property for the application date, so maybe this is tricky. Since SHACL can't check dates directly without a property, maybe this condition is too vague. The user might need to include a property like 'applicationDate' before the 'hasEmployment' start date. But since the ontology doesn't mention such properties, maybe this requirement can't be modeled. The user should not include ambiguous requirements, so maybe skip this part.\n\nThird, the new self-employment or job must be suitable to overcome dependency on benefits. The ontology has 'workforceIntegrationProblemBecause' which links to Disability. But the requirement is about the activity's suitability. Maybe there's a property indicating this. Looking at the ontology, maybe 'triggeringEvent' or 'reducesWorkProspectsPermanently' for Disability. Alternatively, maybe the Employment has a 'commissionedByEmploymentAgency' or something. Wait, the ontology has 'FederalEmploymentAgency' as a RehabilitationProvider. Maybe the employment needs to be commissioned by them? The ontology has 'commissionedByEmploymentAgency' as a DataProperty on Training. Since the new activity is Employment or SelfEmployed, perhaps the 'hasEmploymentStatus' is SelfEmployed or something else. Alternatively, maybe this is a subjective assessment, so can't be modeled. Since the requirement is at the discretion of the Jobcenter, maybe we can't model it, so exclude it.\n\nFourth, the Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration into the general job market. Not sure how to model necessity. Maybe implies that other benefits aren't available, but the user has to have no priority claims over other benefits. The ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' which links a person to a SocialBenefit they can't claim. Maybe the user must have 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' other benefits. But the exact list isn't given, so perhaps this is ambiguous and can't be modeled.\n\nFifth, the employment must be at least 15 hours per week. The ontology has 'workHoursPerWeek' on Employment. So the Employment must have workHoursPerWeek >= 15. So a sh:property with sh:minInclusive 15.\n\nAdditional conditions for self-employment: positive assessment by the Jobcenter on personal suitability and economic viability. Since this is an assessment, maybe requires a property like 'jobCenterAssessment' with a boolean, but the ontology doesn't have that. So these are subjective and can't be modeled, so exclude.\n\nSo the main points to model:\n\n- Received Bürgergeld before starting the activity.\n- Employment has workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n- The user must have a current employment (maybe inEmployment is true?)\n\nWait the first condition says \"Sie erhalten vor Aufnahme Ihrer neuen Tätigkeit Bürgergeld\". So before starting the new activity, they were receiving Bürgergeld. So the user must have received it in the past. The 'receivedBenefit' property is for past benefits, so check that the Bürgergeld is in the receivedBenefit list.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have an Employment with workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nBut also, the user must not be in another employment? Or maybe the new employment is the current one. The EmploymentStatus could be something like 'SelfEmployed' or 'Employee'. The ontology has 'EmploymentStatus' individuals like SelfEmployed, Employee, etc.\n\nWait the Employment is linked via 'hasEmployment' to the person, so the shape would target the Employment node.\n\nWait the main shape should be for the Person, but the SHACL shape needs to define the conditions. Let me think.\n\nThe SHACL shape will be for the Person who is applying, so the shape's target class is ff:Person.\n\nConditions:\n\n1. They have a receivedBenefit (Bürgergeld) before starting the new job. So:\n\n   sh:property [\n     sh:path ff:receivedBenefit;\n     sh:minCount 1;\n     sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n   ]\n\nBut how to ensure it was before starting the new job? Without a date property, this can't be checked. So perhaps the requirement is ambiguous in terms of date, so maybe just check that they have received it at some point. The condition says \"vor Aufnahme\", so before starting. Since there's no way to model the temporal aspect, maybe this is too ambiguous and should be excluded. But the user might expect it to be included as a basic check, ignoring the timing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'receivedWithinLast3Years' property on SocialBenefit, but that's a boolean on the benefit itself. Not sure. The ontology's receivedWithinLast3Years is a DataProperty on SocialBenefit, which might not be applicable here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a receivedBenefit that is Bürgergeld. So even if the timing can't be checked, include the existence.\n\n2. The Employment (or SelfEmployment) has workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAssuming the Employment is linked via 'hasEmployment', so:\n\nThe shape for the Person would have a path to the Employment's workHoursPerWeek.\n\nWait the Employment is a separate node. So in SHACL, the shape for the Person must have a property path to the Employment's workHoursPerWeek. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n  sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n]\n\nBut need to ensure that the Employment exists. So also check sh:minCount 1 on hasEmployment.\n\nBut what about self-employment? The EmploymentStatus includes SelfEmployed. Maybe the Employment can be self-employment, but the ontology's Employment class may include that. Alternatively, maybe SelfEmployed is an EmploymentStatus, so the person's employmentStatus must be SelfEmployed or Employee, but the hours are still needed.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement applies to both employment and self-employment, as long as the work hours are at least 15.\n\nSo the above path should cover it.\n\n3. The application must be before starting the employment. Since there's no property for application date or employment start date, this can't be modeled, so exclude.\n\n4. The benefit is necessary for integration. Maybe they must not have other benefits that are priority? The ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver', but without knowing which benefits are priority, can't model. So exclude.\n\nThus, the final SHACL shape will have:\n\n- Target: Person\n- Must have received Bürgergeld (via receivedBenefit)\n- Must have an Employment with workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nWait, but the user might have multiple employments. Need to ensure that at least one employment meets the hours.\n\nAlternatively, the Employment is the current one. The 'hasEmployment' is current employment.\n\nAlso, the 'Bürgergeld' is the individual B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nNow, putting this into SHACL:\n\nThe shape for eligibility would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n\n:ShapeEinstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the second property requires that there's at least one hasEmployment with workHoursPerWeek >=15. The sh:minCount 1 on the path ensures that there is at least one employment, and the workHoursPerWeek is at least 15.\n\nAlternatively, the path ff:hasEmployment can have multiple, so the workHoursPerWeek must be >=15 for at least one.\n\nThat should work.\n\nAdditionally, the employment must be the new one, but without date info, can't model that.\n\nSo this should be the SHACL.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:Shape_Einstiegsgeld\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld requirement\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ; # Minimum 15 hours/week employment\n    sh:minCount 1 ; # Must have at least one employment meeting this\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Bürgergeld' benefit. First, I need to parse the eligibility conditions given in German and map them to the provided ontology.\n\nStarting with the first condition: The person must be \"erwerbsfähig\". The requirements under this include being able to work at least 3 hours daily and being at least 15 years old, but not having reached the retirement age. The retirement age varies based on birth year, so I need to represent the age check. The ontology has ff:hasAge as a data property for age, so that's straightforward. For the retirement age, the description mentions it's 67 for those born after 1963, but before that it's variable. However, since the exact calculation might depend on individual cases, I can't model the exact age cutoff dynamically. The condition says \"nicht die Altersgrenze der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung erreicht haben\", so maybe using a property like ff:isPensionable (which indicates if they've reached retirement age) would work. The user must not be pensionable. Also, the 3 hours per day: the ontology has ff:employableHoursPerDay, so that should be ≥3.\n\nSecond condition: \"hilfebedürftig\", meaning they can't cover their basic needs and those of non-erwerbsfähige household members from their own means, income, or other priority benefits. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit which should be false. That data property is exactly for this purpose.\n\nThird condition: no priority claims over other benefits or persons. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links a person to a social benefit if they have no priority claims. Since the benefit here is Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931), the person must have this property pointing to it, and the value should be true? Wait, looking at the ontology, the domain is Person and range SocialBenefit, but the description says \"if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority\". Maybe the property is a flag indicating that they have no such claims. Wait, the definition says \"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So for Bürgergeld, the person should have this property with the value being Bürgergeld, and the existence of this link implies they don't have priority claims. Hmm, maybe I need to use a sh:hasValue constraint here. Alternatively, perhaps the property's existence indicates that, so sh:hasValue might not be needed. Wait, maybe the property is a boolean? Wait no, in the ontology, ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is an object property to SocialBenefit. So perhaps the user must have this property pointing to the Bürgergeld, and that's sufficient. Wait, the description says \"have no priority claims over other Leistungsträgern\". Maybe the presence of the property with the benefit as the object indicates that they have no such claims for that benefit. So in SHACL, we can require that the person has a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link to the specific Bürgergeld benefit. But how to express that in SHACL? Maybe using sh:object includes the benefit node. Alternatively, perhaps the ontology might have a data property, but looking back, I see that ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is an object property. So the shape for the person should require that they have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver relationship to the Bürgergeld instance.\n\nFourth condition: living in Germany. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence, which should point to Germany (ff:Germany). So the person's countryOfResidence must be Germany.\n\nNow, translating these into SHACL shapes:\n\nThe main shape is for ff:User (the person) to be eligible for Bürgergeld (ff:B1000119_LB_106311931). The SHACL graph will define a shape that the user must conform to.\n\nBreaking down each condition:\n\n1. Erwerbsfähig:\n   a. Age ≥15: ff:hasAge ≥ 15\n   b. Not reached pension age: ff:isPensionable is false (since isPensionable is true when they have reached it)\n   c. Employable hours per day ≥3: ff:employableHoursPerDay ≥ 3\n\n2. Hilfsbedürftig: ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false\n\n3. No priority claims: must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linking to Bürgergeld. So in SHACL, a property path constraint that the person has a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the value being the Bürgergeld individual.\n\nWait, but SHACL can require that the object is exactly that instance. So using sh:object with sh:in including that individual.\n\n4. Country of residence is Germany: ff:countryOfResidence = ff:Germany\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL:\n\nThe shape will have a targetClass of ff:Person (since User is a Person). But the benefit is Bürgergeld, which is a SocialBenefit. The shape should be for people eligible for this benefit, so maybe the shape is connected via the isEligibleFor property.\n\nAlternatively, the shape can be defined as the conditions that the person must satisfy to be eligible. So the SHACL shape for the User node (ff:User) must meet all these constraints.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStart with the base shapes. The shape for the User (Person) should have all these constraints. The SHACL shape would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n\n:ShapeBuergergeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;  # Assuming the user is a Person\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in (ff:B100019_LB_106311931) ] ;  # Ensures the object is exactly that benefit\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"Person meets Bürgergeld eligibility criteria.\" .\n\nWait, but sh:class isn't the right way here. The ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must link to the specific SocialBenefit instance. So for the property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, the object must be exactly ff:B100019_LB_106311931. So in SHACL, use sh:object with sh:in including that node.\n\nWait, SHACL's sh:object can take a list of allowed values. So:\n\nFor the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver property:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:object [ sh:in (ff:B100019_LB_106311931) ] ;\n].\n\nAlternatively, since it's an object property, the path is ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, and the value must be exactly the Bürgergeld individual. So the above should work.\n\nAlso, checking for the absence of priority claims might require that this link exists. Because the presence of the link indicates they have no priority claims over this benefit. The description says \"Sie haben keine vorrangigen Ansprüche...\", so the person must have this property pointing to the benefit. Hence, the minCount 1 is needed.\n\nWait, but maybe the property is a flag. Wait, looking back at the ontology's definition of ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver:\n\n\"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\"\n\nSo, if a person has this property pointing to Bürgergeld, it means they have no priority claims over it. Therefore, the user must have that property pointing to Bürgergeld. Hence, in SHACL, the path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must have at least one value that is Bürgergeld.\n\nThus, the above constraint is correct.\n\nPutting all these together, the SHACL shape should enforce all these constraints.\n\nNow, check for any missing or ambiguous parts:\n\nThe age condition also mentions the retirement age based on birth year, but since that requires a calculation (exact birth date) which isn't captured in the ontology's properties (we only have hasAge as years), perhaps we can't model the exact retirement age. The condition says \"nicht die Altersgrenze der Rentenversicherung erreicht haben\", so using ff:isPensionable (which is a boolean) is appropriate here. The ontology's ff:isPensionable is defined as \"True, if a person has reached the legal retirement age, false otherwise.\" So that's perfect. So the constraint is that isPensionable is false.\n\nOther points:\n\n- The person must be in Germany: countryOfResidence must be Germany (ff:Germany).\n\n- The \"hilfebedürftig\" part is covered by canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false.\n\n- The \"erwerbsfähig\" part also requires the ability to work at least 3 hours a day (employableHoursPerDay ≥3).\n\nAll other conditions seem covered. The \"leben in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" is covered by countryOfResidence.\n\nI think that's all. Now, serializing this into Turtle.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:ShapeBuergergeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:message \"Person meets Bürgergeld eligibility criteria.\" ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"Age must be at least 15 years.\" ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must not have reached legal retirement age.\" ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"Must be able to work at least 3 hours daily.\" ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Cannot cover basic needs of benefit unit.\" ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:object [ sh:in (ff:B100019_LB_106311931) ] ;\n        sh:message \"No priority claims over Bürgergeld must exist.\" ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"Residence must be in Germany.\" ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem step by step. I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the unemployment benefit 'Arbeitslosengeld' based on the given conditions. First, I'll go through the requirements outlined in the text and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nThe social benefit in question is Arbeitslosengeld (Unemployment Benefit) with ID B100019_LB_576842. The eligibility criteria are divided into three main points: being unemployed, having registered unemployment, and meeting the insurance period requirement.\n\nStarting with the first criterion: the person must be unemployed. According to the text, this means either not being in an employment relationship or working less than 15 hours per week. Additionally, they must be available for placement by the employment agency. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the employment status is captured via the ff:hasEmploymentStatus property. The ontology includes the Individual: RegisteredUnemployed which seems directly related. However, the exact employment statuses that qualify might be better checked via ff:Unemployed or ff:JobSeeker. Wait, the ontology lists ff:Unemployed as a type of EmploymentStatus with the comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" That sounds exactly like the condition here. So if the person's employment status is Unemployed, that covers both parts (not in employment or <15h/week and available).\n\nThe availability part is already encapsulated in the Unemployed status, so I can model the first condition by ensuring the person hasEmploymentStatus equal to ff:Unemployed.\n\nSecond criterion: registration as unemployed. The text mentions electronic or personal registration. The ontology doesn't have a direct property for registration method, but maybe the registration itself is implied by having the correct employment status. However, the SHACL needs to enforce that the person has registered. Since registration is part of becoming unemployed, perhaps the presence of the ff:Unemployed status already implies that, so maybe no additional property here. Alternatively, the ontology might have a property indicating registration. Looking at the ontology's properties, there's ff:inEmployment which is a boolean. Wait, but that's about being in employment. Alternatively, maybe the registration is captured by the ff:hasEmploymentStatus being Unemployed. So perhaps this is covered by the first condition.\n\nThird, the insurance period requirement: within the last 30 months, at least 12 months of compulsory insurance. The ontology has ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 which is a boolean data property on ff:Person. So we can require that this property is true.\n\nAdditionally, there are some notes about considering certain periods like receiving substitute payments (Krankengeld) or care for relatives, but the SHACL should only include what's in the ontology. The ontology's ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 might already encapsulate these considerations, so we just check that it's true.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape for eligibility would:\n\n- Target the Person class (since the benefit is for people).\n- Require that the person's employment status is exactly ff:Unemployed.\n- Require that the compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is true.\n\nWait, but the registration part? The text mentions registration via e.g., electronic or personal means. Since the ontology doesn't have a specific property for registration method, maybe that's considered part of having the Unemployed status. So perhaps that's already covered.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would be structured as follows:\n\n1. Define a shape for the benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842) which targets the Person class.\n2. Use sh:property constraints for each requirement:\n   a. For employment status: sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus, sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed.\n   b. For the insurance period: sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30, sh:hasValue true.\n   \nWait, but SHACL uses sh:property to define constraints on properties. Let me check the exact syntax.\n\nWait, the employment status is a property from Person to EmploymentStatus. So the constraint would be that the person must have a hasEmploymentStatus exactly equal to Unemployed. Similarly, the compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true.\n\nSo the shape would look like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ShapeArbeitslosengeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n.\n\nBut also, the benefit itself must be linked via isEligibleFor. Wait, the shape is for validating if a person is eligible, so the shape should define the conditions that the person must satisfy. The actual link to the benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842) is perhaps the shape's identifier, but in SHACL, shapes are about the data nodes. So the shape is for the Person node, and the conditions must hold for them to be eligible. The benefit is the target of the isEligibleFor property, but the validation is about the person meeting the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the shape is correctly structured as above. The SHACL graph will ensure that any Person node that meets these constraints can be considered eligible for the benefit.\n\nI need to make sure that all required elements from the text are covered:\n\n- Being unemployed (covered by hasEmploymentStatus Unemployed)\n- Registration (implied by the employment status)\n- Insurance period (covered by the boolean)\n- The other considerations (like substitute payments, care, etc.) are part of the insurance calculation, which the ontology's compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 already includes, so no need to model those explicitly here.\n\nThus, the SHACL should look like this. Let me double-check the ontology for any other possible properties. For instance, the registration might require an event of registration. The ontology has ff:hasEvent, but that's for events on Person or Employer. The MoveToGermany is an event, but registration isn't directly modeled. Since the ontology doesn't have a specific property for registration method, we can't model that. The problem says to not model ambiguous or third-party decisions, so maybe that's acceptable. The main points are covered.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ShapeArbeitslosengeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n        sh:message \"Person must have employment status 'Unemployed'.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must have 12 months of compulsory insurance in last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung' with IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The user provided the ontology and the conditions in German, so I need to translate those into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the conditions given:\n\n1. \"Sie erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" - The person receives basic security benefits. Looking at the ontology, the SocialBenefit individual for basic security is SocialAssistance (ff:Sozialhilfe). The property to check is ff:receivesBenefit. So, the user must have a receivesBenefit link to SocialAssistance.\n\n2. \"Die Notwendigkeit der Unterstützungsleistung wurde im Gespräch mit Ihrer Integrationsfachkraft festgestellt.\" - The necessity was determined in a conversation with an integration specialist. The ontology has an individual called IntegrationAssistance (ff:IntegrationAssistance). Maybe this means the person must have participated in some program related to that? Wait, the exact wording is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps there's an event or a property indicating that this conversation happened. But the ontology doesn't have a direct property for that. Since the ontology might not explicitly model this interaction, maybe this condition is too ambiguous or discretionary and can't be modeled. The user's strict rule says not to model ambiguous or third-party assessed conditions. Hmm. Since it's determined in a conversation with a specialist, that might be an administrative decision not captured in the ontology. So perhaps this condition can't be translated into SHACL as per the rules, so we skip it.\n\n3. \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" - Participation was approved by the Job Center before the measure starts. The Job Center is likely the Federal Employment Agency (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). Looking at the ontology, the Participation is via the ff:participates property. But how to express approval? Maybe the Training instance (since Teilnahme refers to a measure, which is a Training subclass) has a property that it was commissioned by the employment agency. The ontology has a DataProperty ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training. So the Training must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true.\n\nWait, the third condition says the participation was approved by the Jobcenter. The Training must be commissioned by them, so the Training's ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency should be true. Also, the user must participate in that training. So the person must have a participates link to a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape should check:\n\n- The person must be linked to SocialAssistance via receivesBenefit.\n- The person's participates object (Training) must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nNow, constructing the SHACL:\n\nThe target is ff:Person, but specifically the user (ff:User), but SHACL shapes can be more general. The shape will apply to the user. The SocialBenefit instance for the target benefit is B100019_LB_102730340, but since that's not in the ontology (the ontology lists B100019_LB_102716305 etc.), maybe it's a new individual? But the user says not to invent terms outside the ontology. Wait, the given benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102730340, which isn't listed. The ontology includes B100019_LB_102716305 (the transitional allowance). Hmm, this might be an issue. But the user might have a typo? Alternatively, perhaps the benefit is a new one not in the ontology. Since we can't invent terms, maybe the benefit is not listed, but perhaps the conditions can still be modeled without referencing the benefit's individual. Alternatively, maybe the benefit's shape is about the user's eligibility conditions, not needing to reference the benefit itself. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe SHACL is to validate user data to determine eligibility. The shape should be for the user (ff:User) to satisfy the conditions. The benefit's ID might not be needed in the constraints unless we link it, but the main thing is the conditions. So proceed.\n\nFirst condition: ff:receivesBenefit [ ff:SocialAssistance ]\n\nSecond condition: Not modeled because it's discretionary (determined in a conversation, which is administrative approval not modeled in ontology).\n\nThird condition: The participates (Training) must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have:\n\n- A shape for the person (user) with:\n\n  - A constraint that they must have a ff:receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance.\n\n  - A constraint that their ff:participates (if they have one) must have ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nWait, but the third condition says that the participation was approved by Jobcenter before the measure starts. The measure is the training, so the training must have been commissioned (commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true). So the person must participate in a training that has that property set.\n\nIn SHACL, that would be a property path: ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency should be true.\n\nSo the shape would look like:\n\nShape for the user (maybe targetClass ff:Person):\n\n- Receives SocialAssistance via receivesBenefit:\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n  ]\n\n- And the participates must have the commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true:\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n  ]\n\nBut wait, the second condition uses a property path. However, SHACL allows such paths. Also, the user must have at least one participates that meets this.\n\nAlternatively, the participates must exist and the training must have that property.\n\nSo, combining these constraints into a shape that the user must meet both conditions.\n\nAlso, check if the user has the participates property. Maybe the third condition implies that the user is participating in such a training, so the participates must exist (minCount 1) and the training must have the commissioned flag.\n\nAlternatively, the existence of participates is part of the condition, so:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nand then the other constraint on the training.\n\nAlternatively, the second constraint can be a nested shape.\n\nBut for simplicity, using the path should work.\n\nPutting this all together in Turtle:\n\nThe shapes graph will have a shape for the user (maybe called something like EligibilityForBenefitB100019_LB_102730340) that has these constraints.\n\nNow, the SHACL syntax:\n\nPrefixes needed: sh, rdf, rdfs, xsd, ff.\n\nThe shape will be a sh:NodeShape with targetClass ff:Person (assuming the user is an instance of Person, which they are as per ontology's ff:User is a Person).\n\nBut maybe the target is specifically the user, but SHACL can target a class.\n\nWait, the user's data would have instances of ff:Person (like ff:User). The shape should apply to all persons who are candidates, so targetClass ff:Person.\n\nBut perhaps the shape is for the specific benefit's eligibility, so the shape's target is the person, and the constraints are as above.\n\nSo:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:EligibilityForBenefit rdf:type sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:participates/(ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, the path for the second property is ff:participates followed by the commissionedByEmploymentAgency data property. In SHACL, property paths can be written using /, so ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency.\n\nAlternatively, in Turtle, you can write:\n\nsh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency; sh:propertyPath ff:participates ] ?\n\nNo, better to use the path notation correctly. The correct path is ff:participates followed by the data property.\n\nSo the path is written as \"ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency\".\n\nThus, in Turtle:\n\n[\n    sh:path ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\nThis ensures that for at least one participates target (the training), the commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nAdditionally, we should ensure that the participates property exists. However, the third condition states that the participation was approved, so the person must be participating in such a training, hence the participates must exist. The sh:minCount 1 on the path ensures that there is at least one such training where the property is true. So that's covered.\n\nNow, check if there are any other constraints. The second condition about the integration specialist's approval is not modeled because it's an administrative decision not present in the ontology. The user's rules say not to model ambiguous or third-party assessed requirements.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should have these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:EligibilityForB100019_LB_102730340 rdf:type sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must receive Social Assistance (Grundsicherung)\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Participation in training must be approved by Jobcenter (commissionedByEmploymentAgency=true)\n        sh:path ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' benefit. First, I need to parse the given conditions and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nThe benefit ID is B100019_LB_582429, which isn't listed in the ontology's individuals. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or not included. But since the user mentioned the text refers to this ID, I'll proceed with the name \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\" and check the ontology for related classes. \n\nThe conditions are:\n1. You get the benefit if you're work-unable due to an insurance case (Versicherungsfall).\n2. Insurance cases include work accidents, commutes accidents, and occupational diseases.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant classes are:\n- WorkAccident (Arbeitsunfall)\n- CommutingAccident (Wegeunfall)\n- OccupationalDisease (Berufskrankheit)\n- UnfitForWork (as an EarningCapacity type)\n\nThe benefit is part of the Statutory Accident Insurance, so the SocialBenefit instance might be related to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance, but the exact individual isn't listed. Maybe create a new one? Wait, the user's ontology includes ff:B100019_LB_102716305 labeled as \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld\". The target benefit is Verletztengeld, which might be a different one. Since it's not present, perhaps use a blank node or assume it's part of existing ones. Alternatively, maybe the user expects using the closest available, but better to check. Since the user's task is to generate SHACL for the given text, perhaps the benefit is the one mentioned, even if not in the ontology. But since the ontology's Individuals don't list it, maybe I can use a URI based on the given ID. Wait, the user's task says to use only terms from the ontology. Since the benefit isn't listed, maybe it's an oversight, but the user might expect using the existing ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance somehow. Alternatively, perhaps the benefit is linked via the trigger event. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the benefit is represented by the ID given, even if not in the ontology. Since the user requires using only the ontology's terms, perhaps the benefit isn't explicitly there, but the conditions can still be modeled via the properties.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape should validate that a person (ff:Person) is eligible for this benefit. The main conditions are:\n\n- The person must have an earning capacity of UnfitForWork (ff:UnfitForWork)\n- The cause of this UnfitForWork must be due to an event that is either WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would check:\n\n1. The person has an earning capacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity) that is exactly UnfitForWork.\n2. The earning capacity's triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent) must be an instance of one of the three event types.\n\nAdditionally, the triggering event must be linked to the earning capacity. Let's structure this.\n\nFirst, create a shape for the person (ff:Person) that must have an earning capacity that is UnfitForWork. Then, that earning capacity must have a triggering event which is one of the allowed event types.\n\nSo, the SHACL shape would look like this:\n\nShape for the Person:\n\n- The person must have exactly one hasEarningCapacity that is a UnfitForWork.\n- That UnfitForWork must have a triggering event which is either WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nWait, but the triggering event is on the EarningCapacity. So:\n\nThe EarningCapacity (which must be UnfitForWork) must have a ff:triggeringEvent that is a member of (WorkAccident OR CommutingAccident OR OccupationalDisease).\n\nAdditionally, since the benefit is 'Verletztengeld', perhaps the person must be linked to this benefit via ff:isEligibleFor, but the ontology doesn't have this benefit as an individual. The user's task says to model only what's in the ontology. Maybe the benefit is not part of the ontology, so perhaps the SHACL is just validating the conditions without explicitly linking to the benefit. Alternatively, maybe the benefit is part of the existing ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance, but that's an Insurance class. Hmm, maybe the SHACL is just ensuring that the person meets the conditions, regardless of the benefit's existence in the ontology.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL might need to link to the benefit via ff:isEligibleFor, but since the benefit isn't in the ontology, perhaps it's better to model the conditions without that. The user's instruction says to model based on the text's requirements, so perhaps the shape is for the person to have those conditions, which would mean they are eligible for the benefit.\n\nSo, the shape would be:\n\nStart with a shape for the person:\n\nsh:targetClass ff:Person\n\nThen, the constraints:\n\n- hasEarningCapacity must be exactly one instance of ff:UnfitForWork.\n\nThen, for that EarningCapacity (ff:UnfitForWork), it must have a triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent) which is one of the allowed event types.\n\nSo, the EarningCapacity's triggering event must be a member of (WorkAccident OR CommutingAccident OR OccupationalDisease).\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with a property path:\n\nff:hasEarningCapacity / a [ sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]\n\nWait, no, the triggering event is on the EarningCapacity. So:\n\nThe person's earning capacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity) must be an instance of ff:UnfitForWork, and that instance must have a triggering event that is one of the three event types.\n\nTherefore, two constraints:\n\n1. The earning capacity must be exactly ff:UnfitForWork.\n\n2. The triggering event of that earning capacity must be a member of the allowed events.\n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nFirst, the person must have an earning capacity that is exactly UnfitForWork.\n\nThen, for that earning capacity, the triggering event must be an instance of one of the event types.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\nShape for Person:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:UnfitForWork ; \n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but SHACL's nesting might require using sh:node in the first property to go further.\n\nAlternatively, using property paths:\n\nThe path for the triggering event is ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent.\n\nSo the constraints would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:UnfitForWork ;\n]\n\nAND\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]\n]\n\nBut also, the triggering event must exist. So:\n\nWait, the first part ensures the earning capacity is UnfitForWork, and the second ensures that its triggering event is of the correct type.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the person must have such an earning capacity. So combining these.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape would be:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:VerletztengeldShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:UnfitForWork ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:class [\n                sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nAlternatively, using nested properties. Or perhaps the second property should be a separate constraint:\n\nAlternatively, using a separate constraint on the path ff:hasEarningCapacity/ff:triggeringEvent with the class restriction.\n\nWait, in SHACL, if you have a path that is a property path (like ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent), then you can apply constraints on that path. So perhaps:\n\nThe first property ensures that the earning capacity is exactly UnfitForWork.\n\nThe second property checks that the triggering event is one of the allowed types.\n\nThus:\n\nff:VerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:UnfitForWork ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n    ] .\n\nThis might be better, as it separates the two constraints.\n\nNow, ensuring that the person has exactly one hasEarningCapacity that is UnfitForWork, and that its triggering event is one of the three.\n\nAdditionally, the triggering event must exist. The sh:minCount 1 on the triggering path ensures that.\n\nAnother consideration: The UnfitForWork instance must have a triggering event. The first constraint ensures the earning capacity is UnfitForWork, and the second ensures that the triggering event is of the right type.\n\nThis should cover the conditions given in the text.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for any missing links. The ff:triggeringEvent is defined for EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. Since the UnfitForWork is a subclass of EarningCapacity, it's okay.\n\nAlso, the WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, and OccupationalDisease are all subclasses of Event, which matches the domain of triggeringEvent.\n\nThus, the SHACL should be valid.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:VerletztengeldShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;\n    sh:property [\n        # The person must have exactly one EarningCapacity that is UnfitForWork\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:UnfitForWork ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n        # The triggering event of that UnfitForWork must be a WorkAccident/CommutingAccident/OccupationalDisease\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ \n            sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) \n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"
