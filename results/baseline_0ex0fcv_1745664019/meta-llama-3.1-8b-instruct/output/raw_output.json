The conditions are:\n\n* You have suffered an occupational injury, commuting accident, or recognized occupational disease.\n* You participate in a qualified measure for participation in working life (vocational rehabilitation).\n\nNote that this SHACL graph only addresses the conditions mentioned in the text.

It has several properties that define the conditions for eligibility for the `Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld` benefit.\n\n1. `ff:hasEvent` property: This property targets the `Event` class and has an invalid report expression that checks if the event is a work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease. If it is, the benefit is not applicable.\n2. `ff:hasEarningCapacity` property: This property targets the `EarningCapacity` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the person is unfit for work or has full earning capacity. If the person is unfit for work, they are eligible for the benefit.\n3. `ff:hasEmploymentStatus` property: This property targets the `EmploymentStatus` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the person is unemployed. If they are, they are eligible for the benefit.\n4. `ff:hasIncome` property: This property targets the `Income` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the income is not not applicable. If it is not not applicable, the person is eligible for the benefit.\n5. `ff:hasInsurance` property: This property targets the `Insurance` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the person has statutory accident insurance. If they do, they are eligible for the benefit.\n6. `ff:hasDisability` property: This property targets the `Disability` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the person has a hearing impairment, visual impairment, or severe disability. If they do, they are eligible for the benefit.\n7. `ff:hasResidencePermit` property: This property targets the `ResidencePermit` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the person has a tolerated residence permit. If they do, they are eligible for the benefit.\n8. `ff:countryOfEmployment` property: This property targets the `Country` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the country of employment is Germany. If it is, the person is eligible for the benefit.\n9. `ff:countryOfResidence` property: This property targets the `Country` class and has a valid report expression that checks if the country of residence is Germany. If it is, the person is eligible for the benefit.\n\nNote that this is a simplified example and may not cover all the conditions for eligibility for the `Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld` benefit."

Lebensjahr vollendet haben und dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI sind oder\n  * das 18. Lebensjahr vollendet haben und\n  * in einer Werkstatt für behinderte Menschen oder anderer Leistungsträger das Eingangsverfahren und den Berufsbildungsbereich durchlaufen oder in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\n\nSozialhilfe ist eine nachrangige Leistung, die Personen erhalten, die sich\nnicht selbst helfen können. Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere\nUnterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen. Werden sie\nnicht rechtzeitig erfüllt und muss deswegen die Sozialhilfe eintreten, gehen\ndie Ansprüche unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen auf die zuständige Stelle über,\nwelche sie dann ihrerseits geltend machen kann.\n\nSHACL:\n",

SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF

It checks for the following conditions:\n\n* The applicant and the person they are accompanying have a statutory health insurance policy.\n* The person being accompanied is receiving inpatient treatment in a hospital.\n* The accompanying person needs to be present for at least 8 hours, including travel time.\n* The accompanying person has a loss of earnings.\n* The accompanying person is a close relative or part of the immediate circle.\n* The person being accompanied is receiving services under the Integration Assistance Act.\n* The applicant is not receiving a benefit from the health insurance company for accompanying the person with a disability.\n\nNote that this is a simplified example and the actual SHACL graph may need to be more complex and nuanced to accurately reflect the eligibility criteria."
