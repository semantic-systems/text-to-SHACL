The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the provided social benefit description. The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I must ensure the SHACL is syntactically valid, using only core components.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the main conditions from the text. The user is eligible for the 'Waisenrente' if they meet specific criteria related to the deceased person and their relationship.\n\n1. **Death Due to Insurance Event**: The deceased must have died because of an insurance event like a work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease. In the ontology, these are subclasses of 'ff:Event'. So, I'll use 'sh:property' with 'ff:triggeringEvent' and 'sh:in' to include these events.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Deceased**: The user must be a biological child, stepchild, foster child, grandchild, or sibling of the deceased. The ontology has properties like 'ff:hasChild', 'ff:stepChildTo', etc. I'll create a property path using these to ensure the user is connected to the deceased through these relations.\n\n3. **Household and Support**: For stepchildren, foster children, grandchildren, or siblings, they must have lived in the same household as the deceased and been supported by them. The 'ff:sameHouseholdAs' property can check if they lived together. Additionally, 'ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker' can verify that the deceased was their primary caregiver.\n\n4. **Financial Dependence**: Alternatively, the user might be eligible if the deceased was primarily responsible for their living expenses. This can be checked using 'ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker'.\n\n5. **Age and Situation**: If the user is between 18 and 27, they must be in education, have a disability preventing self-support, or be in a transitional period. The ontology has properties like 'ff:isInTransitionalPeriod', 'ff:hasDisability', and 'ff:participates' (for education/training). Each of these will be added as separate constraints.\n\nI'll structure each condition as a separate shape, using logical ORs where necessary. Each shape will target 'ff:User' and use appropriate SHACL constraints to validate the conditions.\n\nI must ensure all terms used are from the provided ontology and avoid any ambiguity. For example, using 'ff:hasDisability' instead of inventing a new term.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize everything in Turtle syntax, ensuring proper formatting and enclosing it within triple backticks as required.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [sh:inverse ff:hasChild, ff:deceasedSpouse, ff:deceasedCivilPartner] ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n              sh:in (ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease) ]\n            [ sh:path [sh:inverse ff:parentalAdress] ;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n                            sh:hasValue ff:User ] ;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ;\n                            sh:hasValue ff:User ] ]\n            [ sh:path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ;\n              sh:hasValue ff:User ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:lessThanOrEquals 27 ;\n        sh:gte 18 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:participates ;\n              sh:in ff:Training ]\n            [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n              sh:equals true ]\n            [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ;\n              sh:equals true ]\n        )\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL validation graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Einstiegsgeld'. The target is always the node \"ff:User\". Let me break down the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must receive Bürgergeld before starting their new activity. In the ontology, Bürgergeld is an individual of type ff:SocialBenefit with the ID ff:B100019_LB_576986. So, I'll need a constraint that checks if the user is receiving this benefit. That translates to a sh:property shape for ff:receivesBenefit with the value ff:B100019_LB_576986.\n\nNext, the user must apply before starting their new employment. This means the application date (ff:hasDate) of the event (which is the application) must be before the start date of the employment. However, the ontology doesn't have a specific property for the application event's date. Wait, maybe I should use ff:hasEvent for the employment and check its date. But I'm not sure if the application event is modeled. Maybe I need to assume that the employment's start date is after the application. Alternatively, perhaps the application is an event linked to the user, so I can use ff:hasEvent with a date before the employment starts. Hmm, this might be tricky. I'll need to model it as a constraint where the event's date is before the employment's start.\n\nThen, the new self-employment or employment must be suitable to overcome the user's need for assistance. This is a bit vague, but perhaps it relates to the user's earning capacity. So, I can check if the user's earning capacity is not reduced. Using ff:hasEarningCapacity with a value of ff:FullEarningCapacity makes sense here.\n\nThe user's employment must be at least 15 hours per week. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek as a data property. So, I'll set a constraint that this value is at least 15.\n\nFor self-employment or business start-ups, there are additional requirements. The Jobcenter must positively assess the user's personal suitability and the economic viability. However, the ontology doesn't have properties for these assessments. Since I can't model unclear requirements, I might have to skip these unless there's an existing property. But looking back, I don't see any, so I can't include them.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create a shape with these constraints. Each condition will be a separate sh:property. I'll make sure to target the correct nodes and use the appropriate values. I'll also ensure that the SHACL syntax is correct and that I'm using only core components without inventing new terms.\n\nI think that's all I can do based on the given ontology and requirements. Now, I'll structure this into the SHACL Turtle syntax.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path [ sh:inverse ff:triggeringEvent ] ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:dateTime ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:FullEarningCapacity ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n      sh:min 15 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility criteria for the Kinderzuschlag benefit. The target is the ff:User node, so all constraints should start from there.\n\nFirst, the child must be under 25, not married or in a civil union, and live in the same household. So I'll use ff:receivesChildBenefitFor to point to the child. Then, I'll add constraints: ff:hasAge < 25, not ff:hasMaritalStatus of Married or CivilUnion, and same household with ff:sameHouseholdAs.\n\nNext, the user must receive Kindergeld. I'll use ff:receivesBenefit to ff:B100019_LB_576986, which is Kindergeld.\n\nFor income, there are two cases: couples and single parents. I'll split this into two shapes. For couples, the combined income (ff:familyGrossIncome) should be at least 900 EUR. For singles, ff:personalGrossIncome should be at least 600 EUR. I'll use sh:Or to combine these two conditions.\n\nThe income used for calculation shouldn't reduce the benefit to zero. I'll use ff:reducesChildSupplementTo > 0.\n\nNo considerable assets: ff:hasConsiderableAssets should be false.\n\nThe user must be able to cover family needs with their income and benefits. I'll use ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit set to true.\n\nLastly, the benefit is secondary to other income sources. So, the user shouldn't be eligible for higher priority benefits, using ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver.\n\nI'll structure each condition as separate shapes and combine them with sh:And. I'll make sure to use only SHACL Core components and stick to the given ontology without inventing new terms.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path [sh:inverse ff:receivesBenefit] ;\n      sh:or (\n        [sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986]\n      ) ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNode ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxCount 1 ;\n          sh:min 0 ;\n          sh:max 24 ;\n        ] ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n          sh:in (ff:Single ff:Divorced ff:Widowed) ;\n        ] ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n          sh:hasValue sh:subject ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n      sh:or (\n        [sh:datatype xsd:decimal ; sh:min 900]\n        [sh:path ff:personalGrossIncome ; sh:datatype xsd:int ; sh:min 600]\n      )\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:decimal ;\n      sh:min 0 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n      sh:equals true ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n      sh:node ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph to validate eligibility for the 'Bürgergeld' benefit. Let's break down the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be 'erwerbsfähig' (capable of working). That means they can work at least 3 hours a day and are at least 15 years old. Also, they shouldn't have reached the pension age, which is 67 for those born after 1963. I'll need to check the data properties for these conditions: ff:employableHoursPerDay, ff:hasAge, and ff:isPensionable.\n\nNext, the user needs to be 'hilfebedürftig' (in need of assistance). They can't support themselves or their dependents through their income, assets, or other prior benefits. So, I'll look for ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit, which should be false.\n\nThen, there should be no prior claims with other providers. The property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver should point to the 'Bürgergeld' benefit. Also, they must live in Germany, so ff:countryOfResidence should be ff:Germany.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL shape with these constraints, ensuring each condition is properly linked and the shape targets ff:User.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:BuergergeldEligibilityShape\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n      sh:min 3 ;\n  ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n      sh:min 15 ;\n  ] , [\n      sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n  ] , [\n      sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n  ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n  ] , [\n      sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n  ] .\n```"

Arbeitskleidung\n    * Kinderbetreuungskosten\n\nFörderungsfähige Berufsausbildung:\n\n  * Es ist Ihre erste Berufsausbildung oder\n  * wenn es nicht Ihre erste Berufsausbildung ist: Sie können nicht auf eine andere Weise dauerhaft beruflich eingegliedert werden.\n  * Sie machen eine Berufsausbildung. \n    * die nach dem Berufsbildungsgesetz, der Handwerksordnung oder dem Seearbeitsgesetz anerkannt ist\n    * oder eine Berufsausbildung nach Teil 2 des Pflegeberufegesetzes.\n  * Sie schließen einen Berufsausbildungsvertrag ab.\n\nWenn Sie eine Behinderung haben, können Sie Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe auch\nbekommen, wenn\n\n  * Sie eine Berufsausbildung machen, die abweichend von den Ausbildungsordnungen für staatlich anerkannte Ausbildungsberufe oder in Sonderformen für behinderte Menschen durchgeführt wird,\n  * Sie Ihre Ausbildung verlängern müssen,\n  * Sie die Ausbildung aufgrund Ihrer Behinderung ganz oder teilweise wiederholen und eine dauerhafte Teilhabe am

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' benefit based on the provided text. Let me start by understanding the eligibility criteria step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be an instance of ff:User, which is a subclass of ff:Person. So, the shape will target ff:User.\n\nLooking at the text, the main criteria are divided into two parts: the person must be eligible, and the training must be eligible.\n\nFor the person's eligibility:\n\n1. They must be at least 18 years old. So, I'll use ff:hasAge with a minimum of 18.\n2. They shouldn't live with their parents during training, or the training location is too far from their parents' home. I'll model this with ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany.\n3. If they're not German, they shouldn't have certain residence statuses like asylum seeker or tolerated for less than 15 months. I'll use ff:hasAsylumActPermit and ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months.\n4. They must not have sufficient means to cover their costs. So, ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds should be false.\n\nFor the training's eligibility:\n\n1. It must be their first vocational training, so ff:isFirstVocationalTraining.\n2. If it's not the first, they can't be integrated otherwise, but SHACL can't model that, so I'll skip it.\n3. The training must be recognized under specific laws, so I'll use ff:recognizedByLaw with the appropriate codes.\n4. They must have a training contract, so ff:subjectToContract with ff:VocationalTrainingContract.\n\nAdditionally, for people with disabilities, there are special conditions. I'll create a separate shape for that, checking ff:hasDisability and the specific conditions like extended training or living with parents.\n\nI need to make sure all these conditions are properly connected using sh:and and sh:or where necessary, and that each condition is a valid SHACL constraint using the given ontology terms.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, I'll structure these into SHACL shapes and link them appropriately.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n      sh:min 18 ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path [ sh:inverse ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ] ;\n      sh:min 1 ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ;\n      sh:max 0 ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ;\n      sh:max 0 ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:participates ;\n      sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n          sh:equals true ;\n        ] ,\n        [\n          sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n          sh:in ( ff:VocationalTrainingAct, ff:CraftsCode, ff:NursingProfessionsAct ) ;\n        ] ,\n        [\n          sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n          sh:class ff:VocationalTrainingContract ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nff:DisabilityException\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n      sh:equals true ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:participates ;\n      sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n          sh:equals true ;\n        ] ,\n        [\n          sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n          sh:in ( ff:VocationalTrainingAct, ff:CraftsCode, ff:NursingProfessionsAct ) ;\n        ] ,\n        [\n          sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n          sh:class ff:VocationalTrainingContract ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Kindergeld' (child allowance). The target is the node \"ff:User\", which represents the parent applying for this benefit. \n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements into sections: those that apply to the parent and those that apply to the child.\n\nStarting with the parent's eligibility:\n\n1. The parent must be fully taxable in Germany or be treated as such. This includes EU, EEA, or Swiss citizens. So, I'll look for properties related to tax liability. In the ontology, there's ff:incomeTaxLiability with a range of ff:TaxLiabilityScope. The individual ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability represents unlimited tax liability, so I'll set a shacl:equals constraint on this.\n\n2. For EU/EEA citizens who moved to Germany after August 2019, they must meet certain conditions under the Freedom of Movement Act after the 4th month. These include being employed, self-employed, job-seeking, having sufficient means, health insurance, or having a permanent residence permit. Since this is conditional based on the date of moving, it's a bit complex. However, the ontology has ff:permanentRightOfResidence, which fits the permanent residence part. So, I'll include a shacl:property constraint for this.\n\n3. The parent must either be a citizen of the EU, EEA, Switzerland, or have a valid residence permit allowing employment, or be a recognized refugee. The ontology has ff:isNationalOf pointing to ff:Country, and ff:recognizedRefugee as a boolean. Also, ff:hasResidencePermit can be used. So, I'll create a shacl:or constraint that checks if the parent is a national of an EEA country, has a residence permit, or is a recognized refugee.\n\nMoving on to the child's eligibility:\n\n1. The child must reside in Germany, another EU country, EEA country, or Switzerland. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence pointing to ff:Country, which includes these regions. So, I'll use a shacl:equals constraint on the country being part of ff:EEAplusCH.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL graph with these constraints. Each condition will be a separate shape connected with shacl:or where necessary. The target is ff:User, and each constraint is attached to this node.\n\nI need to ensure I'm using only SHACL Core components and not inventing any new terms. I'll also avoid any ambiguous requirements, focusing only on what can be clearly assessed from the ontology.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax, making sure it's syntactically valid and properly formatted.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix shacl: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  shacl:property [\n    shacl:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n    shacl:equals ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n  ] ,\n  [\n    shacl:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ;\n    shacl:equals \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] ,\n  [\n    shacl:or (\n      [\n        shacl:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        shacl:in (\n          ff:EEAplusCH\n        )\n      ] ,\n      [\n        shacl:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n        shacl:equals \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ,\n      [\n        shacl:path ff:recognizedRefugee ;\n        shacl:equals \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ]\n    )\n  ] .\n\nff:User\n  shacl:property [\n    shacl:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    shacl:in (\n      ff:EEAplusCH\n    )\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility criteria for the social benefit 'Ausbildungsgeld'. The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I have to make sure the SHACL constraints are correctly applied.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements. The user must have a disability, and their rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency. That translates to checking if the user has a disability and is linked to the correct provider.\n\nNext, the user must be participating in one of the specified training programs. The ontology has a property 'ff:participates' which links to 'ff:Training'. Since the text lists specific types of training, I'll need to ensure that the training instance is of one of those types. I'll create a shape for the training and use 'sh:or' to cover all the allowed types.\n\nLastly, the user shouldn't be eligible for transition allowance. I'll use the 'ff:isEligibleFor' property and set an inverse constraint to ensure they don't have this benefit.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll define the main shape for 'ff:User' and link it to the necessary properties and sub-shapes as required. I'll make sure to use only SHACL Core components and stick strictly to the provided ontology without inventing new terms.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:participates ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNodeOr ;\n      sh:shape [\n        a sh:PropertyShape ;\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:node [\n          a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingAct ;\n          ] , [\n            sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      ] ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n      sh:maxCount 0 ;\n      sh:inverse true ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph to validate eligibility for the social benefit \"Arbeitslosengeld\" based on the given text. The target is always the node \"ff:User\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the eligibility criteria from the text:\n\n1. The user must be unemployed, which means:\n   - They are not in an employment relationship, or\n   - They work less than 15 hours a week and are available for the employment agency's placement efforts.\n\n2. The user must have registered as unemployed either electronically or in person, and submitted an application form.\n\n3. Within the last 30 months before registration, the user must have been insured for at least 12 months. This includes periods where they received benefits like sick pay, or were caring for a family member or raising a child. It also includes times when they were self-insured or worked abroad under specific conditions.\n\nNow, I'll map these criteria to the ontology provided.\n\nFor the first criterion, I'll check if the user is either not employed (ff:inEmployment is false) or works less than 15 hours (ff:workHoursPerWeek < 15) and is available for placement (ff:availableForPlacement is true).\n\nNext, the registration requirement can be checked using ff:isEligibleFor pointing to the unemployment benefit, but since the text mentions registration, I'll need a property that indicates successful registration. However, the ontology doesn't have a direct property for this, so I might need to infer it through the application process, perhaps using ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor.\n\nFor the insurance period, I'll use ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30, which directly matches the 12 months requirement. Additionally, I'll include other relevant periods like receiving sick pay (ff:hasIncome), caring for a family member (ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker), or self-employment (ff:employer).\n\nI'll structure the SHACL graph with a main shape for ff:User, containing each condition as a separate constraint. Each constraint will use the appropriate SHACL components like shacl:property, shacl:minCount, and shacl:equals to enforce the criteria.\n\nI need to ensure that the SHACL is syntactically correct and uses only core components. I'll also avoid modeling ambiguous requirements, sticking strictly to the ontology terms provided.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UnemploymentEligibilityShape\n    a sh:Shape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:predicate ff:inEmployment ;\n        sh:defaultValue false ;\n        sh:equals false ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:predicate ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n        sh:max 14 ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:predicate ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:predicate ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:predicate ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:object ff:B100019_LB_576842 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph to validate eligibility for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' with the ID B100019_LB_102799525. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance.\n2. They must have remarried or entered into a new civil partnership after being widowed.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ontology to find relevant properties and classes. \n\nFor the first condition, the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits. In the ontology, I see ff:isEligibleFor links a person to a social benefit they're eligible for. So I'll create a shape for ff:User that requires ff:isEligibleFor pointing to B100019_LB_102799525.\n\nNext, the second condition is about remarriage or a new civil partnership. The ontology has ff:hasMaritalStatus, which links to ff:MaritalStatus. The individual ff:Married represents being married, which indicates remarriage. So another shape will check if the user's marital status is ff:Married.\n\nI need to ensure each condition is a separate shape and that they both target ff:User. I'll use sh:property to specify the properties and sh:hasValue for the specific individuals. Both shapes should be part of the same SHACL graph.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax in Turtle. Each shape will have a unique identifier, like :EligibilityShape and :MaritalStatusShape. I'll link them using sh:shapes to the target node ff:User.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize everything in Turtle format within triple backticks as required.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:User\n  sh:shapes (\n    [\n      sh:property ff:isEligibleFor ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102799525 ;\n      sh:message \"Must be eligible for survivors' benefits from statutory accident insurance\" ;\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:property ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:Married ;\n      sh:message \"Must have remarried or entered into a new civil partnership\" ;\n    ]\n  ) .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL validation graph based on the provided eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung' with IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints should apply to this node.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text into individual conditions:\n\n1. The user receives basic security benefits (Leistungen der Grundsicherung).\n2. The need for support was determined in a discussion with the integration specialist (Integrationsfachkraft).\n3. Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure began.\n\nNow, I'll map each condition to the ontology provided.\n\nFor the first condition, receiving basic security benefits can be represented using the property ff:receivesBenefit. The specific benefit is 'Bürgergeld', which is ff:B100019_LB_102716305. So, the user must have this benefit.\n\nThe second condition involves an assessment by the integration specialist. The ontology has a property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, which links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority. Since the need was determined, I'll use this property to ensure the user isn't eligible for higher-priority benefits.\n\nThe third condition is about approval from the Jobcenter. The ontology has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency, which is a boolean indicating if training was commissioned by the employment agency. So, the user's participation must be commissioned by the agency.\n\nPutting it all together, each condition becomes a SHACL triple with the user as the subject and the respective properties and values as objects.\n\nI'll structure the SHACL graph with each condition as a separate triple, ensuring the syntax is correct and only using SHACL Core components. I'll serialize it in Turtle syntax within triple backticks as specified.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n<https://foerderfunke.org/default#UserShape>\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102730340 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility criteria for the social benefit 'Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung'. Let me break down each condition and see how to translate them into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, the user must have a severe visual or hearing impairment or be at risk of developing one. Looking at the ontology, I see that 'ff:hasDisabilityType' links a person to a disability. The disabilities 'ff:VisualImpairment' and 'ff:HearingImpairment' are subclasses of 'ff:Disability'. Also, 'ff:severeDisability' is a data property that indicates if a disability is severe. So, I'll create a constraint that checks if the user has a severe visual or hearing impairment.\n\nNext, the responsible rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency, which is 'ff:FederalEmploymentAgency' in the ontology. The property 'ff:hasRehabilitationProvider' links a person to their provider. So, I'll add a constraint that ensures this property points to the Federal Employment Agency.\n\nThe third condition states that the person's prospects of participating in working life are significantly reduced due to the severity of their disability, and they need help with workforce integration. The property 'ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently' indicates if a disability permanently reduces work prospects. Since the condition mentions the reduction is not temporary, I'll set this property to true.\n\nLastly, the person must be willing to undergo vocational training or integration. The data property 'ff:isVocationalReturnee' indicates if someone is willing to reintegrate vocationally. I'll include a constraint that this property is true.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure these constraints under a shape targeting 'ff:User', ensuring each condition is properly linked and the SHACL syntax is correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:VisualImpairment, ff:HearingImpairment ;\n      sh:severity sh:Violation ;\n      sh:message \"High-degree visual or hearing impairment required.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n      sh:severity sh:Violation ;\n      sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      sh:severity sh:Violation ;\n      sh:message \"Permanent reduction of work prospects required.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      sh:severity sh:Violation ;\n      sh:message \"Willingness for vocational training or integration required.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' with IDLB B100019_LB_582422. The user data is in RDF format, and the SHACL graph will validate whether a user is eligible.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements. The first condition is that the user has had a work accident, commuting accident, or an occupational disease. In the ontology, these are represented as classes under ff:Event: ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident (which is a subclass of ff:Event), and ff:OccupationalDisease. So, I need to check if the user is connected via ff:hasEvent to any of these events.\n\nThe second condition is that the user is participating in a qualified measure for occupational rehabilitation, which is a type of training. The ontology has ff:OccupationalRehabilitation as a class, and it's related via the property ff:participates. So, the user must have an ff:participates relationship to an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nI'll structure the SHACL graph with two main constraints. The first constraint will ensure the existence of a relevant event. The second will ensure participation in the appropriate training. Both constraints must be satisfied for eligibility.\n\nI need to make sure the SHACL graph targets the node \"ff:User\". I'll use the property shapes to define the constraints. For the first condition, I'll use sh:property to specify ff:hasEvent, and sh:in to list the allowed event types. For the second condition, another sh:property for ff:participates, referencing ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nI should also ensure that the SHACL syntax is correct, using the appropriate prefixes and structure. I'll write the constraints within a sh:ShapesGraph, defining each shape with a logical AND to combine them.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize everything in Turtle syntax, making sure to enclose it within triple backticks as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:ShapesGraph ;\n  sh:shape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:hasEvent ;\n      sh:in (\n        ff:WorkAccident\n        ff:CommutingAccident\n        ff:OccupationalDisease\n      )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:participates ;\n      sh:in ff:OccupationalRehabilitation\n    ] ;\n    sh:logicalAND (\n      _:b1\n      _:b2\n    )\n  ] .\n```"

This could be the opening of insolvency proceedings against the employer, a rejected insolvency application due to lack of assets, or the complete cessation of business operations due to obvious lack of assets.\n\n2. Before the insolvency event, the user didn't receive any salary for up to 3 months.\n\n3. The user must be an employee, either employed in Germany or temporarily sent abroad but still subject to German social insurance.\n\n4. The user needs to prove their employee status through a ruling from the German Pension Insurance's clearing office, especially if they are in specific roles like a managing partner, GmbH shareholder, or a relative of the employer.\n\nNow, I'll map these conditions to the ontology provided.\n\nFor condition 1, I'll need to check if the user has an event of type ff:InsolvencyProceeding, and whether it's open, rejected for lack of assets, or the business ceased operations. So, I'll create a property shape for ff:hasEvent, expecting exactly one instance, and then a shape for the event itself with the necessary conditions.\n\nCondition 2 involves the user not receiving salary for up to 3 months before the event. I'll check if the event has a data property ff:wageCutOffsetMonths with a value indicating this period.\n\nCondition 3 requires the user to be an employee in Germany or temporarily abroad. I'll use the employment status to check if they are an employee and their country of employment is Germany.\n\nCondition 4 is about proving employee status. I'll check if the user has a status from the clearing office, which in the ontology is handled by the property ff:isEligibleFor, expecting the specific social benefit.\n\nI'll structure these conditions using SHACL's constraint components, ensuring each part is logically connected and targets the ff:User node. I'll use property shapes, node shapes, and logical constraints like sh:and to combine them.\n\nI need to ensure that all terms used are from the provided ontology and that the SHACL syntax is correct. I'll avoid any ambiguous requirements and stick strictly to the given data properties and object properties.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax, making sure it's enclosed within triple backticks as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n      sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n      sh:maxCount 1 ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:isOpen ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:equals true ;\n      ] , [\n          sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:equals true ;\n      ] , [\n          sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:equals true ;\n      ] ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:inEmployment ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n      sh:equals true ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n      sh:class ff:Employee ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:countryOfEmployment ;\n      sh:class ff:Germany ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n      sh:class ff:B100019_LB_576848 ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (Statutory Accident Insurance Injury Benefit). The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I must use only SHACL Core components and terms from the provided ontology.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements. The user is eligible if they receive injury benefit due to an insurance event that caused work disability. The insurance events include work accidents, commuting accidents, and occupational diseases.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant properties and classes are:\n- ff:receivesBenefit to link the user to the benefit.\n- ff:hasEvent to link the benefit event.\n- ff:isA to specify the type of event, which can be ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, or ff:OccupationalDisease.\n- ff:unfitForWork to indicate the user's work disability.\n\nI'll structure the SHACL graph with a main shape for ff:User. It will have two constraints:\n1. The user must receive the specific benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842).\n2. There must be an event (ff:hasEvent) of a type that is one of the allowed insurance events.\n3. The user must be unfit for work (ff:unfitForWork = true).\n\nI need to ensure the SHACL syntax is correct, using properties like sh:property, sh:class, sh:hasValue, and sh:in. I'll also use sh:message for descriptions.\n\nI should avoid any ambiguous conditions and stick strictly to the ontology terms. Now, I'll assemble these into a Turtle syntax SHACL graph.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:property ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ;\n        sh:message \"Must receive Verletztengeld from statutory accident insurance.\"\n    ] , [\n        sh:property ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or (\n                ff:WorkAccident\n                ff:CommutingAccident\n                ff:OccupationalDisease\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Must have an insurance event causing work disability.\"\n    ] , [\n        sh:property ff:unfitForWork ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Must be unfit for work due to the insurance event.\"\n    ] .\n```"

Lebensjahr vollendet haben und\n  * in einer Werkstatt für behinderte Menschen oder anderer Leistungsträger das Eingangsverfahren und den Berufsbildungsbereich durchlaufen oder in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\n\nSozialhilfe ist eine nachrangige Leistung, die Personen erhalten, die sich\nnicht selbst helfen können. Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere\nUnterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen. Werden sie\nnicht rechtzeitig erfüllt und muss deswegen die Sozialhilfe eintreten, gehen\ndie Ansprüche unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen auf die zuständige Stelle über,\nwelche sie dann ihrerseits geltend machen kann.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' (ID: L100040_LB_8664880). The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I must use only SHACL Core components, adhering strictly to the provided ontology.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the eligibility criteria:\n\n1. **Age or Disability**:\n   - The user must either have reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII (ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit = true) or be permanently and fully disabled (ff:hasDisability with ff:severeDisability = true and ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true).\n\n2. **Participation in Specific Programs**:\n   - The user must be participating in either an EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or have a vocational training contract (ff:participates in ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or ff:VocationalTrainingContract).\n\n3. **Means Testing**:\n   - The user must not have sufficient means (ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence = false) and cannot cover their basic needs (ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds = false).\n\n4. **No Prior Claims**:\n   - The user must not have other benefits with priority (ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver = L100040_LB_8664880).\n\nI'll structure each condition as a separate SHACL shape, using conjunctions where necessary. Each shape will target ff:User and use the appropriate properties from the ontology. I'll ensure that the SHACL syntax is correct and that all terms are used as defined in the provided ontology.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:EligibilityGrundsicherung\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [sh:inverse ff:isEligibleFor] ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880 ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:hasValue [\n      a ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n      sh:hasValue [\n        a ff:VocationalTrainingContract ;\n      ] ;\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence ;\n    sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n    sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880 ;\n  ] .\n```"

Lebensjahr noch nicht vollendet hat,\n  * Sie vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung (zum Beispiel Krankengeld, Arbeitslosengeld) hatten und\n  * keine andere in Ihrem Haushalt lebende Person Ihr Kind betreuen kann.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld'. The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints will apply to instances of this class.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements one by one:\n\n1. **Household Member with School or Kindergarten Accident**: The user must have a child in their household who has had a school or kindergarten accident. In the ontology, this translates to the user having a child (using ff:hasChild) who has experienced a ff:SchoolAccident or ff:KindergartenAccident. So, I'll create a property pair for ff:hasChild and specify the required event using sh:hasValue.\n\n2. **Child Under 12**: The child must be under 12 years old. The ontology has ff:hasAge, so I'll set a maximum allowed value of 11 (since it's not yet completed 12). Using sh:max and sh:datatype with xsd:int should work.\n\n3. **Entitlement to Earnings or Benefits Before Care**: Before caring for the child, the user must have been entitled to earnings or benefits. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus, and possible statuses include ff:Employee or ff:JobSeeker. So, I'll check that the user's employment status is one of these. Using sh:in on the property will cover this.\n\n4. **No Other Household Member Can Care for the Child**: There should be no other person in the household who can care for the child. This is a bit tricky. I'll need to ensure that for all other household members (connected via ff:sameHouseholdAs), none of them can take care of the child. Using sh:property and sh:maxCount 0 should enforce that no such person exists.\n\nPutting it all together, each condition becomes a SHACL constraint. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes and structure each part properly. I also need to ensure that the SHACL syntax is correct and that I only use Core components without any extensions.\n\nI should also assign a unique shape name, maybe something descriptive like 'EligibilityShape_Kinderverletztengeld', and link it to the target class ff:User. Each constraint will be a part of this shape.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure each part into the SHACL Turtle syntax accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:EligibilityShape_Kinderverletztengeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SchoolAccident, ff:KindergartenAccident ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:max -1 ;\n        sh:condition [\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n            sh:max 11 ;\n            sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:in (ff:Employee ff:JobSeeker) ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:condition [\n            sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n            sh:equals true ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

Der\nLeistungsanspruch gilt für Kinder und junge Menschen bis zur Vollendung des\n25. Lebensjahres. Leistungen zur Teilhabe am sozialen und kulturellen Leben in\nder Gemeinschaft werden bis zur Vollendung des 18. Lebensjahres bezuschusst.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Bildung und Teilhabe' (Education and Participation). The target is the node \"ff:User\", which represents the user data to be validated.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text to understand the eligibility criteria. The benefit is for young people if they or their families receive certain benefits. The listed benefits are Bürgergeld (SGB II), Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe (SGB XII), Asylbewerberleistungen, or if they have low income.\n\nSo, the main conditions are:\n1. The user must be a young person, specifically a child or young adult up to 25 years old.\n2. The user or their family must be receiving one of the specified benefits, or they have a low income but can't cover the costs themselves.\n\nI need to model these conditions using SHACL. Since the user is the target, I'll start by creating a shape for ff:User.\n\nFor the age condition, I'll use ff:hasAge and set the maximum to 25. Using sh:lessThan ensures the age is below or equal to 25.\n\nNext, I need to check if the user receives any of the eligible benefits. The benefits listed are Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Sozialhilfe, and Asylbewerberleistungen. In the ontology, these correspond to specific individuals under ff:SocialBenefit. I'll use ff:receivesBenefit with sh:in to check if the user is receiving any of these benefits.\n\nAdditionally, there's a condition for families with low income who can't cover the costs. This is a bit trickier because it's a bit vague, but I can model it using ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds set to false. However, the text says they can't cover the costs themselves, so maybe I should check if their personal basic needs can't be covered.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape for ff:User will have two constraints: one for the age and one for receiving the correct benefits or having low income.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only using SHACL Core components and not inventing any terms outside the provided ontology. Also, I should avoid ambiguous requirements, but the ones listed are clear enough.\n\nNow, I'll structure the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax, ensuring it's syntactically valid. I'll define the shape and link it to the target class ff:User. Then, I'll add the age constraint and the benefit/low-income constraint.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the Turtle code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:Shape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:predicate ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:max 25 ;\n        sh:lessThan xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:predicate ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:in (\n            ff:B100019_LB_576842  # Unemployment benefit\n            ff:L100040_LB_8665924  # Housing benefit\n            ff:B100019_LB_581863   # Child supplement\n            ff:B100019_LB_106311931 # Citizen benefit\n        ) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' (IDLB B100019_LB_102716305). The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints must apply to this node.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Disability and Rehabilitation Provider**: The user must have a disability and require special support for vocational integration. The responsible rehabilitation provider should be the Federal Employment Agency.\n\n   - Use ff:hasDisability with a boolean value true.\n   - Use ff:hasRehabilitationProvider pointing to ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n2. **Participation in Specific Measures**: The user must be participating in one of the listed training programs.\n\n   - Create a sh:or constraint for ff:participates, where each option is a subclass of the allowed training types (ff:VocationalTraining, ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, etc.).\n\n3. **Employment History (Vorbeschäftigungszeit)**: The user must meet one of the conditions in the last 3 years.\n\n   - Use ff:eligibleWithinLast3Years with true for the relevant benefits.\n   - Create a sh:or constraint for the three scenarios: social insurance for 12 months, unemployment benefits, or entitlement to SVG benefits.\n\n4. **Exceptions**:\n\n   - If the user is a vocational returnee with a disability, the 3-year condition is waived. Use a sh:or with ff:isVocationalReturnee and ff:hasDisability.\n   - If the user obtained a relevant qualification in the last year, the condition is also waived. Use ff:participates with a suitable training type.\n\nI need to ensure all constraints are clearly defined and only use terms from the provided ontology. I'll structure each condition using SHACL's property and class constraints, making sure to use sh:or for multiple options and sh:nodeKind for class checks. Each condition is annotated with comments for clarity.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  \n  # Condition 1: Has disability and requires special support for vocational integration\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    sh:equals true ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:node ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 2: Participates in specific training measures\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:or (\n      :ff_VocationalTraining\n      :ff_EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n      :ff_Berufsvorbereitung\n      :ff_Unterstützte_Beschäftigung\n      :ff_BeruflicheWeiterbildung\n    )\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 3: Employment history (Vorbeschäftigungszeit) requirements\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:eligibleWithinLast3Years ;\n    sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    sh:equals true ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:or (\n      ff:Arbeitslosengeld\n      ff:Arbeitslosenbeihilfe_nach_dem_Soldatenversorgungsgesetz\n    )\n  ] ;\n\n  # Exception 1: Vocational returnee with disability\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ;\n    sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:or (\n      ff:isVocationalReturnee true\n      ff:hasDisability true\n    )\n  ] ;\n\n  # Exception 2: Recent qualification exception\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:or (\n      :ff_Berufsbildende_Schule\n      :ff_Berufsausbildung\n    )\n  ] .\n```"

Woche nach dem Versicherungsfall hinaus,\n    * um mindestens 20 Prozent.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' (Statutory Accident Insurance Pension). The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints must apply to instances of this class.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements. The user must be legally accident insured, which relates to having statutory accident insurance. Looking at the ontology, the property \"ff:hasInsurance\" with range \"ff:Insurance\" is relevant. The individual \"ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance\" is the specific insurance type, so I'll set an equality constraint here.\n\nNext, the user's earning capacity must be reduced. The ontology has \"ff:hasEarningCapacity\" leading to \"ff:EarningCapacity\". I'll use \"sh:property\" to constrain this property. The reduction must be at least 20%, so I'll check for \"ff:reductionInPercent\" with a minimum of 20. Also, it must be a permanent reduction, so \"ff:isPermanent\" should be true.\n\nThe reduction should be due to an insurance event, which is an instance of \"ff:Versicherungsfall\". However, I don't see this exact term in the ontology, but \"ff:WorkAccident\" is a subclass of \"ff:Event\" and seems relevant. So, I'll use \"ff:triggeringEvent\" to link the earning capacity to a \"ff:WorkAccident\".\n\nThe duration of the reduction should exceed 26 weeks. The property \"ff:reductionDurationInWeeks\" should be greater than 26.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create a shape for \"ff:User\" with these constraints. Each constraint is a separate shape, linked with \"sh:and\" to ensure all must be satisfied. I'll make sure the syntax is correct, using \"sh:property\", \"sh:minCount\", and \"sh:equals\" where appropriate. I'll also use \"sh:nodeKind\" and \"sh:class\" to specify the correct types and classes from the ontology.\n\nI should avoid any ambiguous terms and ensure all properties and classes used are present in the provided ontology. Since the user must be the target, I'll apply all constraints directly to \"ff:User\". I'll also ensure the SHACL graph is serialized in Turtle syntax and enclosed correctly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:equals ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNode ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n      sh:minValue 20 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNode ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:WorkAccident ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n    sh:minValue 27 ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the provided social benefit description. The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I must ensure all constraints are syntactically valid SHACL Core.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the eligibility criteria:\n\n1. The user and the person with a disability must be legally insured.\n2. The person with a disability is being treated in a hospital.\n3. The medical accompaniment is necessary and meets the 8-hour condition.\n4. The user must have a loss of earnings.\n5. The user must be a close relative or in the immediate circle of the person with a disability.\n6. The person with a disability receives participation assistance, and the user isn't receiving sick pay for assisting.\n\nI'll map these to the ontology:\n\n- For legal insurance, I'll use ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance.\n- The hospital stay can be represented with ff:MedicalAccompaniment and its properties.\n- The 8-hour condition is covered by ff:fullDayAccompaniment.\n- Loss of earnings is handled by ff:causesLossOfEarnings.\n- The relationship can be checked using ff:immediateCircleMember.\n- For participation assistance, I'll link to ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nI'll structure each condition as a separate shape and combine them using sh:And. Each shape will target the appropriate property and set the necessary constraints. I'll ensure all constraints are mandatory using sh:minCount and sh:zeroOrMorePath.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize everything in Turtle syntax within triple backticks.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n      sh:datatype ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n      sh:datatype ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:zeroOrMorePath ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n      sh:datatype ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n      sh:datatype ff:Event ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:immediateCircleMember ;\n      sh:datatype ff:Person ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n      sh:datatype ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:logicalAnd (\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:datatype ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n        sh:datatype ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:zeroOrMorePath ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n      ]\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:datatype ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:datatype ff:Event ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:immediateCircleMember ;\n        sh:datatype ff:Person ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:datatype ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n  ) ;\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the provided eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' with IDLB B100019_LB_582441. The goal is to validate RDF user data to determine eligibility. The SHACL graph must target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the eligibility conditions:\n\n1. The user must be the spouse or civil partner of someone who died due to an insured event (work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease).\n2. The user must have been in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership before the insured event occurred.\n3. The marriage or partnership must not have been entered into after the insured event.\n4. The death must not have occurred within the first year of the marriage or partnership.\n\nI'll use SHACL Core components to model these constraints.\n\nStarting with the target:\n- The shape applies to ff:User, so I'll use sh:targetNode ff:User.\n\nNext, the main conditions:\n1. The user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner due to an insured event. I'll use sh:property to check ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. The event must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. So, I'll create a shape for the event and use sh:or to combine the possible event types.\n\n2. The user must have been in a legal union (marriage or civil partnership) before the event. I'll check ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent and ensure it's a valid marital status.\n\n3. The marriage or partnership must have been before the insured event. I'll use a SPARQL condition to ensure the event's date is after the union's start.\n\n4. The death shouldn't be within the first year. I'll calculate the time difference between the event's date and the union's start date, ensuring it's more than one year.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the shapes with appropriate properties and constraints, ensuring all conditions are met. I'll also use sh:or to handle different event types and sh:property to link the user to the event and union.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize everything in Turtle syntax, making sure the syntax is correct and all terms are from the provided ontology.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:property ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n        sh:or (\n            [\n                sh:property ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:WorkAccident\n            ]\n            [\n                sh:property ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:CommutingAccident\n            ]\n            [\n                sh:property ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:OccupalDisease\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:property ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:ivilUnion\n    ] ;\n    sh:sparql [\n        sh:prefixes ff: ;\n        sh:returnType xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:query \"\"\"\n            BIND( ?this as ?user )\n            ?user ff:deceasedSpouse/ff:causeOfDeath/ff:hasDate ?eventDate .\n            ?user ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ?maritalStatus .\n            FILTER( ?eventDate > ?maritalStatusStart )\n        \"\"\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:property ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ;\n        sh:hasValue ?event\n    ] ;\n    sh:sparql [\n        sh:prefixes ff: ;\n        sh:returnType xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:query \"\"\"\n            BIND( ?this as ?user )\n            ?user ff:deceasedSpouse/ff:causeOfDeath/ff:hasDate ?eventDate .\n            ?user ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ?maritalStatus .\n            FILTER( (YEAR(?eventDate) - YEAR(?maritalStatusStart)) > 1 )\n        \"\"\"\n    ] .\n```"
