The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

However, these are necessary to fully capture the requirements described. For the sake of compliance with the instruction, these properties should be added to the ontology or the requirements should be adjusted to fit the existing ontology. Below is an alternative approach using existing properties:\n\nff:Preconditions a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:and (\n        [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]\n        [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:SelfEmployed ; sh:minCount 0 ; sh:maxCount 1 ]\n        [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Employee ; sh:minCount 0 ; sh:maxCount 1 ]\n        [ sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ; sh:minInclusive 15 ]\n        [ sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ; sh:datatype xsd:boolean ; sh:hasValue true ]\n    ) .\n\n# Additional conditions for self-employment can be modeled using existing properties such as `ff:availableForPlacement` and `ff:hasConsiderableAssets`, but these may not perfectly match the requirement. If more specific properties are needed, they should be defined in the ontology.\n```\n\nHowever, I've noted that some of the properties required to fully capture the described eligibility conditions do not exist in the provided ontology. Specifically:\n\n- `ff:hasNewActivitySuitableToOvercomeHelpNeed`\n- `ff:requiresTrainingForGeneralLaborMarketIntegration`\n- `ff:personalSuitabilityEvaluatedPositively`\n- `ff:economicViabilityOfSelfEmploymentEvaluatedPositively`\n\nThese properties would need to be added to the ontology to accurately represent the conditions. Alternatively, if the ontology cannot be modified, the conditions could be approximated using existing properties, but this might not perfectly align with the described requirements. For example, `ff:availableForPlacement` could be used to approximate the suitability of the new activity to overcome help need, and `ff:hasConsiderableAssets` could be used to infer economic viability, though neither is a perfect match."

It ensures that the user has children meeting the specified criteria, receives child allowance or a similar benefit, has sufficient income, does not have considerable assets, can cover the basic needs of their benefit unit, has no priority claims over the child supplement, and is either single, widowed, or divorced. The income conditions are structured to differentiate between single parents and those in a partnership."

It targets the `ff:User` class and checks the user's tax liability, nationality, residence permit, refugee status, and asylum entitlement. Additionally, it ensures that the user has a child who meets the residency requirements either in Germany or in another EU/EWR/Switzerland state, or in a household in these regions while the parent is tax liable in Germany."

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

It ensures that the user is either unemployed or has a part-time job of less than 15 hours per week and is available for placement by the employment agency. Additionally, it checks that the user has been subject to compulsory insurance for at least 12 out of the last 30 months before registering as unemployed, which can include various scenarios such as receiving sickness benefits, caregiving, or self-employment. The graph does not model requirements that are ambiguous or discretionary, such as specific details about electronic identity verification or the exact process of applying through the portal, as these are not clearly assessable through RDF data alone."

Instead, I've modeled the requirement using the existing `ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood` data property, but since this property is defined for `ff:MaritalStatus`, and not directly for `ff:Person`, the SHACL shape is adjusted to check for the presence of a `ff:MaritalStatus` that indicates a new union after widowhood. However, the ontology should ideally include a class or a more direct way to represent this condition for a `ff:Person`. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102799525 ;\n    sh:condition [\n      sh:and (\n        [ sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]\n        [ sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ; sh:hasValue true ]\n      )\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n```\n\nThis SHACL graph checks that the user (`ff:User`) has received the benefit `B100019_LB_102716305` (transitional allowance from statutory accident insurance) and has a marital status indicating they have remarried or entered a new civil union after being widowed."

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

For users under 18 years old, the eligibility for participation in social and cultural life is specifically checked.\n3. The user may receive one of the specified benefits (`Bürgergeld`, `Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag`, `Sozialhilfe`, `Asylbewerberleistungen`).\n4. If the user does not receive any of the specified benefits, they must not be able to cover the basic needs of their benefit unit.\n5. Alternatively, if the user does not receive any of the specified benefits and can cover the basic needs of their benefit unit, they must have a personal gross income less than 1500 EUR.\n6.

It checks if the user (`ff:User`) has a deceased spouse or civil partner due to a work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease and if they were in a legal marriage or civil union before the insurance event. Additionally, it ensures that the user does not have a claim to a new union formed after the insurance event and within the first year of the new union."
