The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the Bürgergeld (Citizen benefit) with the ID B100019_LB_106311931 based on the given conditions. Let me start by breaking down the requirements from the text.\n\nFirst, the eligibility criteria are:\n\n1. **Erwerbsfähig (Employable)**:\n   - At least 3 working hours per day.\n   - Minimum age of 15 years.\n   - Not yet reached the retirement age (which depends on birth year). For those born after 1963, it's 67. Others need to check §7a SGB II. But since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for birth year or retirement age calculation, maybe we can use ff:hasAge and check it's below the age limit? The problem is the retirement age varies, but the text says \"habe die Altersgrenze der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung noch nicht erreicht\" – but since SHACL can't handle dynamic age calculation, perhaps we can set a static check for age < 67, but the user might need to input the correct age. Alternatively, maybe there's a property like ff:isPensionable? Wait, looking at the ontology: there's ff:isPensionable which is true if the person has reached legal retirement age. So the condition would be that isPensionable is false. That seems better because it abstracts the age check. So the condition would be that the person's isPensionable is false.\n\n2. **Hilfsbedürftig (Needy)**:\n   - Cannot cover their own basic needs and those of non-employable dependents in their benefit unit using their own means (income, assets), own work, or priority benefits (like unemployment benefit, housing benefit, child supplement). The ontology has a data property ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit which is a boolean. So this should be false.\n\n3. **No priority claims against others**:\n   - The person must not have priority claims over other benefits or persons. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links a person to a social benefit if they don't have priority claims over it. But since the benefit here is Bürgergeld itself, maybe the condition is that for all other relevant benefits, the person has no priority claims. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the person does not have any priority claims over other benefits. Since the exact modeling is tricky, maybe the presence of ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver for the required benefits is needed. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be receiving or eligible for priority benefits. The text says \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern oder Personen\". So perhaps the user must not be eligible for any higher-priority benefits. Since SHACL can't check for absence of certain properties (unless using sh:property with sh:hasValue false?), maybe it's better to model that the user has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the Bürgergeld benefit. Wait, the property's definition says \"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So if the user has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to Bürgergeld, that would satisfy the condition. So the user must have a triple like User ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ff:B100019_LB_106311931.\n\n4. **Living in Germany**: The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence which points to a Country. So the user's countryOfResidence must be Germany (ff:Germany).\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shapes.\n\nThe target is always ff:User, so the shape will have a targetClass ff:User.\n\nEach condition corresponds to a SHACL constraint.\n\nFor Employable:\n\n- Must have ff:employableHoursPerDay >= 3.0. Since it's a data property of Person, we can use sh:minInclusive.\n\n- Must be at least 15 years old. Use ff:hasAge with sh:minInclusive 15.\n\n- Must not be pensionable. Use ff:isPensionable with sh:hasValue false.\n\nFor Needy:\n\n- ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be false. sh:hasValue false.\n\nFor No priority claims:\n\n- Must have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link to the Bürgergeld benefit (ff:B100019_LB_106311931). So a sh:property constraint on ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with sh:minCount 1 and sh:hasValue pointing to the benefit.\n\nWait, actually, the user must have at least one such triple. The property's range is SocialBenefit, so the value must be the specific benefit. So the shape would require that the user has at least one ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver where the object is Bürgergeld. Alternatively, the user must have exactly that relation to the benefit. So the path is ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, and the value should be equal to the benefit individual. So using sh:hasValue with the benefit's URI.\n\nFor Living in Germany:\n\n- ff:countryOfResidence must be equal to ff:Germany. So sh:property with path ff:countryOfResidence and sh:hasValue ff:Germany.\n\nNow, putting all into SHACL:\n\nStart with the shape for ff:User. Each condition is a separate SHACL constraint component.\n\nFirst, the shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:BuergerGeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Employable hours per day >=3\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3.0\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Age >=15\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Not pensionable (isPensionable is false)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Can't cover basic needs of benefit unit (false)\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Must have no priority claims over Bürgergeld\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Country of residence is Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but for the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, the sh:hasValue must be the exact resource. So the path is ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver and the value is the benefit individual.\n\nAdditionally, check if all required properties are present. For example, the user must have ff:hasAge, ff:employableHoursPerDay, etc. But since the conditions are about their values, maybe the shape also needs to require that these properties exist. However, SHACL's sh:minCount 1 would ensure that the property exists. Wait, in the case of ff:hasAge, if the user doesn't have that property, the shape would fail. So adding sh:minCount 1 for each of those paths might be necessary.\n\nWait, in SHACL, if a property is required to have a value, you need to have sh:minCount 1. Otherwise, the absence is allowed. So for example, for ff:hasAge, if the user doesn't have that property, the condition on minInclusive won't trigger. So to enforce that the property exists, each of these constraints should have sh:minCount 1.\n\nSo for each property in the shape, I need to include sh:minCount 1.\n\nLet me adjust that:\n\nff:BuergerGeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3.0\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ; # Not sure if this is needed. Since it's a data property, maybe it's always present? But better to include to ensure existence.\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] .\n\nBut wait, the ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver needs to have a value exactly equal to the benefit. The sh:hasValue is applied to the object of the triple. So the user must have at least one triple where the predicate is ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver and the object is the benefit.\n\nAnother point: The \"no priority claims\" condition might require that the user does not have any other priority benefits. However, the ontology's ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver links to a SocialBenefit, so having it pointing to Bürgergeld indicates that there are no priority claims over it, which matches the requirement.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for any missing terms. The ff:isPensionable is present, so that's okay.\n\nThe age part: The retirement age for those born before 1964 is variable. Since the ontology doesn't have a way to capture birth year, and SHACL can't compute it, using isPensionable is the right approach here.\n\nThe other points seem covered. The country is straightforward.\n\nI think that covers all the conditions. Now, serialize this in Turtle.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:BuergerGeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Mindestens 3 Stunden täglich arbeiten können\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3.0\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Mindestalter 15 Jahre\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Noch nicht rentenberechtigt\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Kann die Basisbedürfnisse nicht decken\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber Bürgergeld\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Wohnsitz in Deutschland\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] .\n```"

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user wants me to generate a SHACL validation graph for a specific social benefit, given an ontology and a description of the eligibility criteria. The SHACL graph must target the \"ff:User\" node and use SHACL Core components only. \n\nThe social benefit in question is 'Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung' with the IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The conditions provided are:\n\n1. The user receives benefits from the basic security (Grundsicherung).\n2. The necessity of the support was determined in a discussion with their integration specialist (Integrationsfachkraft).\n3. The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the start of the measure.\n\nFirst, I need to translate each of these conditions into SHACL constraints using the provided ontology. Let me go through each condition one by one.\n\nStarting with the first condition: \"Sie erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" The term \"Grundsicherung\" refers to a specific social benefit. Looking at the ontology, there's an individual called ff:SocialAssistance (Bürgergeld), which is part of the SocialBenefit class. But wait, the exact name in the ontology for \"Grundsicherung\" might be different. Let me check the ontology again. \n\nLooking at the individuals under SocialBenefit:\n- ff:B100019_LB_106311931 is labeled as \"Bürgergeld\" which is the German term for \"Citizen benefit\" (probably the basic security). The English label is \"Citizen benefit\". Since \"Grundsicherung\" is commonly referred to as Bürgergeld, I can assume that this is the correct individual. \n\nSo the first condition requires that the user is receiving this benefit. The ontology has the property ff:receivesBenefit which links a person to a social benefit they are currently receiving. Therefore, the SHACL constraint should check that the user has a ff:receivesBenefit relationship to ff:B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nNext, the second condition: \"Die Notwendigkeit der Unterstützungsleistung wurde im Gespräch mit Ihrer Integrationsfachkraft festgestellt.\" This translates to needing some form of confirmation from the integration specialist. However, looking at the ontology, I don't see a direct property that would capture this. The ontology includes properties like ff:hasEmploymentStatus or ff:hasEmployment, but nothing about discussions with specialists. Since the SHACL must not model ambiguous requirements, perhaps this condition can't be directly represented. Wait, maybe the integration specialist's approval is part of a process, but since there's no explicit property in the ontology indicating this, I might have to exclude it as it's not clearly assessable via the provided ontology terms. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Integrationsfachkraft\" is part of some other property. Let me check again. The ontology includes ff:caregiverInHousehold, ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker, but nothing about integration specialists. Since the user must use only terms from the ontology, and if there's no property for this, then this condition can't be modeled. The user's instruction says to not model requirements that can't be assessed due to ambiguity or third-party discretion. Since this condition depends on a third-party's assessment (the integration specialist's determination), which isn't captured in the ontology, perhaps this can't be included. But maybe there's another way. Wait, maybe the \"participates\" property? Or maybe the Jobcenter's approval is part of the third point. Hmm, perhaps this condition is not directly modelable here. I need to note that and see if there's any possible property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Integration Assistance\" benefit (ff:IntegrationAssistance) is related, but that's a social benefit. But the condition is about the necessity being determined in a discussion. Since the ontology doesn't have a property indicating this, I might have to exclude this condition. The user's instruction says to not model ambiguous or third-party requirements, so this might be excluded. So the second condition might not be included in the SHACL graph.\n\nThird condition: \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure started. The ontology has ff:FederalEmploymentAgency as an instance of RehabilitationProvider, and maybe there's a property indicating approval. The ff:subjectToContract or ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency? Let me see. The ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a data property of Training, which indicates if a training was commissioned by the employment agency (Jobcenter). The participation here might relate to a training program. \n\nAssuming the user is participating in a training, perhaps the condition requires that their training (ff:Training) has the ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true. However, the user's RDF data might have a training linked via ff:participates. So the SHACL needs to ensure that the user's current training (linked via ff:participates) has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true. \n\nWait, the condition says \"Teilnahme\" (participation) was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure started. So maybe the training they are participating in must have been commissioned by the Jobcenter. Therefore, the SHACL would check that the user has a participates link to a Training which has commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- The first condition: user has ff:receivesBenefit to ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n- The third condition: user has a participates link to a Training, which has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nThe second condition might not be modelable due to missing ontology terms, so it's excluded.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes:\n\nWe need a shape targeting ff:User. The shape will have two constraints:\n\n1. For the first condition:\n   - A path of ff:receivesBenefit must have exactly one value of ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (since they must receive this benefit).\n   - Or, perhaps, the value should be a SHACL constraint with sh:hasValue. But since it's an object property, we need to ensure that the user has at least one ff:receivesBenefit to that specific individual.\n\n   So using sh:property with sh:path ff:receivesBenefit and sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931, and sh:minCount 1.\n\n2. For the third condition:\n   - The user must have a participates link to a Training that has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true.\n\n   This requires a nested constraint. The participates property must link to a Training node which has commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true. \n\n   In SHACL, this can be done with a sh:property for ff:participates, then within that, a sh:node that has a constraint on the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency.\n\n   So:\n\n   - sh:property [ sh:path ff:participates;\n                   sh:minCount 1;\n                   sh:node [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n                                          sh:hasValue true;\n                                          ] \n                          ]\n                 ]\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle syntax.\n\nNow, checking the ontology again for exact terms. \n\nThe \"Grundsicherung\" is indeed ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld). \n\nThe commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a data property of ff:Training, with range xsd:boolean. \n\nSo the SHACL shape would look like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n  ],\n  [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n\nWait, but the second condition's node must be a Training. However, in SHACL, the node shape can be applied without explicitly checking the type unless necessary. Since participates is defined to have range ff:Training, perhaps it's redundant. But to be safe, maybe the node shape should have sh:class ff:Training, but since the ontology says ff:participates has range ff:Training, the system might already enforce that. However, in SHACL, perhaps it's better to include it to be explicit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's RDF data might have participates pointing to a Training, so the node shape on the target would require that the Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nSo the above structure should work.\n\nNow, the second condition was about the integration specialist's confirmation. Since there's no property in the ontology, it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL graph includes the first and third conditions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  # Condition 1: Receives Grundsicherung (Bürgergeld)\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;  # Bürgergeld (Grundsicherung)\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Condition 3: Participation approved by Jobcenter (commissioned training)\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n```"

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' benefit with ID B100019_LB_582429. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe user must be eligible if they are work-incapacitated due to an insurance event. The insurance events are work accidents, commuting accidents, or occupational diseases. \n\nFirst, the target node is ff:User, so the SHACL shape should start with a node targeting that. The shape's target is ff:User, and it should be a SHACL NodeShape.\n\nNext, the main condition is that the user must have an earning capacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity) that is UnfitForWork (ff:UnfitForWork). So I'll use a property shape for ff:hasEarningCapacity. The value should be exactly UnfitForWork, so sh:hasValue.\n\nThen, the insurance event must be one of the specified types: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. The user must have an event (maybe via some property) that is an instance of one of these classes. Looking at the ontology, the user's earning capacity's trigger event (ff:triggeringEvent) should be the insurance event. So the triggering event must be a member of one of those classes. So, the property path would be ff:hasEarningCapacity -> ff:triggeringEvent. The value of this path should be a node that is a member of one of the allowed classes. Therefore, using sh:class and sh:in to list the three classes.\n\nWait, but how is the event related to the user? The ff:triggeringEvent is a domain of ff:EarningCapacity. So the earning capacity's triggering event must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nSo the shape would have a property path ff:hasEarningCapacity/ff:triggeringEvent. The sh:node property would require that this node is a member of one of those classes. \n\nPutting that into SHACL: For the property shape, the path is ff:hasEarningCapacity/owl:inverseOf(ff:triggeringEvent)? Wait, no. Wait, the user has an earning capacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity), and that earning capacity has a triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent). So the path is ff:hasEarningCapacity ; ff:triggeringEvent. \n\nIn SHACL, the path is written as a sequence. So the path would be [ff:hasEarningCapacity; ff:triggeringEvent]. The value of that path must be an instance of one of the three classes. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL property shape would have:\n\nsh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasEarningCapacity; ff:triggeringEvent ]? Wait, maybe I need to structure the path correctly. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the user (ff:User) has a hasEarningCapacity to some EarningCapacity instance. That EarningCapacity instance has a triggeringEvent to an event. So the path from User to the event is ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent. \n\nSo in SHACL syntax, the path is:\n\nsh:path [\n    sh:inversePath ff:hasEarningCapacity ; \n    sh:path ff:triggeringEvent\n]\n\nWait no, maybe not. Let me recall SHACL path syntax. The path is a sequence of properties. The path from the user to the event would be:\n\nff:hasEarningCapacity followed by ff:triggeringEvent. So the path is:\n\nsh:path [ \n  sh:first ff:hasEarningCapacity ; \n  sh:second ff:triggeringEvent \n]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a list:\n\nsh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent )\n\nWait, SHACL allows path expressions as a list. So the path can be written as a list of properties. So the path is the sequence of properties from the starting node (User) to the target node (the event). \n\nSo the path is ff:hasEarningCapacity followed by ff:triggeringEvent. Therefore, the path is (ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent).\n\nThen, the value of that path (the event) must be a member of one of the allowed classes (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease). \n\nTherefore, the SHACL constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n    sh:class [ \n        sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but sh:class is a constraint where the nodes in that path must be instances of the specified class. So using sh:class and sh:in with those classes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using sh:node with a shape that requires the node to be a member of one of those classes. But using sh:class is more straightforward here.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have at least one such earning capacity. So the presence of the hasEarningCapacity is required. So another property shape for ff:hasEarningCapacity with sh:minCount 1. Wait, but the first property shape already requires that the earning capacity's triggering event is of the right type. So perhaps the first property shape's sh:hasValue and the path already covers that. Wait, no: the hasEarningCapacity must be present, but also that it is UnfitForWork. Wait, the first condition is that the user has an earning capacity that is exactly UnfitForWork. \n\nWait, the first part says: \"Sie erhalten Verletztengeld aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung, wenn Sie aufgrund eines Versicherungsfalls arbeitsunfähig sind.\" So the user must be arbeitsunfähig (unfit for work) because of an insurance event. \n\nThe earning capacity must be UnfitForWork (ff:UnfitForWork). So the user must have an earning capacity that is exactly UnfitForWork. \n\nSo the first property shape is:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n    sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nThen, the triggering event for that earning capacity must be one of the allowed types. \n\nSo the second property shape is the path (ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent) must be an instance of one of the allowed classes. \n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nThe NodeShape for ff:User includes two property shapes:\n\n1. Ensures that the user has an earning capacity of UnfitForWork.\n\n2. Ensures that the triggering event of that earning capacity is one of the allowed events.\n\nAdditionally, we need to make sure that the triggering event exists, but perhaps the second property shape's sh:class constraint implies that the path exists (since it requires the node to be of a certain class, which requires the path to have a node). Or maybe we should have a sh:minCount 1 on the path as well. \n\nAlternatively, the first property ensures that the earning capacity exists, and the triggering event must exist because the second path requires it. But perhaps it's better to explicitly have sh:minCount 1 on the path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) to ensure that the triggering event is present. \n\nWait, but the requirement is that the earning capacity is due to an insurance event. So the earning capacity must have a triggering event. \n\nSo the second property shape's path requires that the triggering event exists (since it's checking its class). If there's no triggering event, then the path would return nothing, which would violate the constraint. So perhaps we can rely on that. \n\nPutting this into code:\n\nThe SHACL Turtle would look like:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n        sh:class [ \n            sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, sh:class expects a single class, not a list. Oh right, so sh:in is for enumerations, but sh:class can take a list via sh:in. Wait, no, sh:class takes a single class. To allow multiple classes, you can use sh:or or sh:in. Alternatively, maybe using sh:node with a sh:or.\n\nWait, the correct way is to use sh:node with a sh:or that includes each of the allowed classes as sh:class constraints. \n\nWait, according to SHACL, the sh:class constraint can only specify a single class. To allow multiple, you can use sh:node with sh:or, each with a sh:class. \n\nAlternatively, since the path (ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent) must point to a node that is an instance of any of the three classes, the correct syntax would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n    sh:node [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] \n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ] \n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nSo this way, the node must be an instance of at least one of the three classes.\n\nTherefore, correcting that part.\n\nAlso, the first property's sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ensures that the earning capacity is exactly that individual.\n\nPutting it all together, the Turtle code should look like:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] \n                [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ] \n                [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n    ] .\n\nThis should satisfy the conditions:\n\n1.

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' benefit. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe benefit (B100019_LB_582441) is for widows/widowers if their partner died due to a work-related accident, commute accident, or occupational disease. They must have been in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership before the incident. They aren't eligible if they married or formed the partnership after the incident and the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nFirst, the SHACL graph must target the ff:User node. I'll use SHACL Core components.\n\nLet me check the ontology for relevant properties and classes. The death of the partner should be linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. The cause of death must be one of the specified events (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease). The event should be the causeOfDeath.\n\nThe user must have been in a valid marriage/partnership before the event. The event's legal union before the event (ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent) should link to the user. Also, the user's marital status must have been married or in a civil union prior.\n\nFor exclusion: If the user entered the relationship after the event and the death was within the first year, they are ineligible. So, check if the event's date plus one year is after the death date. But how to model this? Since SHACL can't compute dates directly, maybe need a data property like ff:lessThanFourMonthsAgo or similar. Wait, looking at the ontology, there's ff:lessThanFourMonthsAgo for events. But the requirement is within the first year. Hmm, maybe the ontology doesn't have a property for that. Since I can't invent terms, maybe the exclusion is tricky. The user must not have a situation where the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent is after the event's date and the death occurred within a year. Since SHACL can't do temporal calculations, perhaps the exclusion is modeled by ensuring that the user does not have a deceased partner where the legal union was formed after the event's date. But how to express that?\n\nAlternatively, the exclusion criteria might not be modelable because it requires checking the timing between the event and the union. Since the ontology doesn't have properties to express that, maybe this can't be handled and should be omitted per the rules. The user must have been in the union before the event. The exclusion is about forming the union after, so maybe the main condition already ensures that. Wait, the main condition says they must have been in a valid union before the event. So the exclusion is a subset of cases where they formed the union after, and death within first year. Since the main condition requires the union to be before, perhaps the exclusion is redundant? Or maybe the main condition includes that the legalUnionBeforeEvent is before the event's date, so the exclusion is not needed because if the union was after, then the main condition isn't met. Wait no. The main condition says \"already before\" the event, so the exclusion is an additional case where even if they were in a union after the event, but death within first year. Hmm, perhaps the SHACL can't capture the timing between the union and the event, so maybe the exclusion can't be modeled and must be excluded from the SHACL. The user must comply with the main conditions, and the exclusion is an extra condition that can't be expressed here. So I should only model the main requirements.\n\nSo, the main conditions are:\n\n1. User has a deceased spouse/civil partner (ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner).\n2. The causeOfDeath is one of the allowed events (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease).\n3. The user was in a valid union before the event (legalUnionBeforeEvent links the event to the user).\n\nWait, the ontology's ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent is a property of the event, pointing to the person (user) who was in the union before. So the event (causeOfDeath) must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nAlternatively, the user must be linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner to the partner who died, and that partner's death's cause is one of the events, and the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user.\n\nHmm, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- The user must have a deceased partner (via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner).\n- The cause of that partner's death (via ff:causeOfDeath) must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n- The event (causeOfDeath) must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user, indicating they were in a valid union before the event.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the user's marital status before the event was valid (maybe via ff:hasMaritalStatus, but not sure). Wait, the ontology's ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent's range is Person, so the event (causeOfDeath) must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user, meaning the user was in a legal union with the deceased before the event.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nShape for ff:User must have:\n\n- A shape that requires:\n\n  - At least one of ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner.\n\n  For each such deceased partner:\n\n  - The partner's ff:causeOfDeath (but wait, causeOfDeath is a property of Person, so the deceased partner would have a causeOfDeath. So the user's deceasedSpouse has a causeOfDeath which is an event of the correct type.\n\nWait, the deceased partner is a Person (since the ontology's ff:deceasedSpouse has range Person). So the user's ff:deceasedSpouse is the partner, and that partner has a ff:causeOfDeath which must be one of the allowed events.\n\nAdditionally, the event (causeOfDeath) must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user, indicating that before the event, they were in a union.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one of the deceased spouse or civil partner:\n\nA shape for ff:User:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\";\n].\n\nThen, for each such deceased partner (let's say ?partner):\n\nThe partner must have a causeOfDeath which is an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse;  // or ff:deceasedCivilPartner, but maybe using a path that covers both?\n  sh:hasValue [ a sh:NodeShape;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causeOfDeath;\n      sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n      sh:minCount 1;\n    ];\n  ];\n].\n\nWait, perhaps better to model this as:\n\nThe user's deceased partner (via either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner) must have a causeOfDeath that is one of those events.\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL path with alternative paths for the deceased partner:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:causeOfDeath ] ;  // Wait no. The path from user to partner to causeOfDeath.\n\nWait, the user's deceasedSpouse is a Person (partner), who has a causeOfDeath (event). So the path from user to causeOfDeath via deceasedSpouse would be:\n\nff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath\n\nSimilarly for deceasedCivilPartner. So combining both paths:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [\n    sh:alternativePath (\n      ( ff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath )\n      ( ff:deceasedCivilPartner / ff:causeOfDeath )\n    )\n  ];\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nThat would require that at least one of those paths leads to an instance of the allowed events.\n\nNext, the event (the causeOfDeath) must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nSo for that event (the causeOfDeath), it must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent that is the user.\n\nSo, again using path:\n\nThe user's deceased partner's causeOfDeath must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent equal to the user.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [\n    sh:alternativePath (\n      ( ff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath / ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent )\n      ( ff:deceasedCivilPartner / ff:causeOfDeath / ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent )\n    )\n  ];\n  sh:equals [ sh:iri ff:User ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nWait, but the user's node is the target, so the user's IRI is the subject. So the path would go from user through deceasedSpouse to partner, then partner's causeOfDeath is the event, then the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent must be the user.\n\nThus, the path from user to legalUnionBeforeEvent via the partner's causeOfDeath must equal the user's IRI. So the user must be the legalUnionBeforeEvent of the causeOfDeath.\n\nHmm, but SHACL shapes are applied to the target node (ff:User). So for each path:\n\nFor each ?partner (deceasedSpouse or civilPartner):\n\n- ?partner has a causeOfDeath ?event.\n\n- ?event has legalUnionBeforeEvent ?user (which is the target, so ?user is the current node).\n\nThus, the constraint would require that for each such path, the ?event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user.\n\nThus, in SHACL:\n\nAnother property shape:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [\n    sh:alternativePath (\n      ( ff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath / ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent )\n      ( ff:deceasedCivilPartner / ff:causeOfDeath / ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent )\n    )\n  ];\n  sh:hasValue [ sh:iri ff:User ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nWait, but SHACL's sh:hasValue requires that the path must have exactly that value. Since the user is the node being validated, the path must end with the user's IRI.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape for ff:User would have these constraints.\n\nNow, the exclusion part: no eligibility if the user entered the union after the event and death within first year. Since we can't model time intervals with SHACL (no temporal functions), perhaps this exclusion can't be modeled. The user must have been in the union before the event, which is already covered by the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to them. The exclusion requires checking if the union was after the event and death within a year, but without properties to express dates or durations, we can't do that.
