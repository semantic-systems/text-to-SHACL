The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL graph based on the eligibility criteria for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente' (Statutory Accident Insurance Widow's Pension) with the ID B100019_LB_582435. The SHACL graph must validate whether a user's data meets the criteria, targeting the \"ff:User\" node.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given social benefit description in German and translate it into SHACL constraints. Let me start by understanding the requirements:\n\nThe widow's pension is granted if the deceased person died due to an insured event (work accident, commuting accident, occupational disease). The applicants can be:\n\n1. Biological child, stepchild, or foster child living in the deceased's household and cared for there.\n2. Grandchild or sibling living in the deceased's household and cared for there.\n3. The deceased mainly covered the applicant's living expenses.\n\nAdditionally, if the applicant is between 18 and 27 years old, they qualify if they are:\n- In school or vocational training,\n- Unable to support themselves due to disability, or\n- In a transition period (up to 4 calendar months) between education periods, after military/civil service, or after voluntary service.\n\nNow, I'll map these requirements to the provided ontology terms. Let's go through each condition.\n\n**1. Deceased Person's Cause of Death**\n- The deceased must have died due to a work accident (ff:WorkAccident), commuting accident (ff:CommutingAccident), or occupational disease (ff:OccupationalDisease).\n- The user must be linked to the deceased via one of the specified relationships (e.g., ff:hasChild, ff:naturalChildTo, etc.).\n- The deceased's death must be caused by one of these events.\n\nIn SHACL, this would involve checking that the user's deceased parent (via ff:deceasedSpouse or similar) has a causeOfDeath (ff:causeOfDeath) that is an instance of one of these classes.\n\nWait, but the user is the beneficiary, so perhaps the user's deceased parent's death must be due to such an event. Let me check the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology, the ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner link a person to their deceased spouse or civil partner. The causeOfDeath is an object property from Person to Event, so the deceased person (e.g., the parent) must have a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nBut in the requirements, the deceased person (the one who died) must have died due to an insured event. So the user must have a deceased parent (or other relative) whose causeOfDeath is one of these events.\n\nHowever, the user is the applicant, so they need to be related to the deceased person. For example, if the user is the biological child of the deceased, then the user has a ff:hasChild relationship pointing to themselves? Wait, no. The ontology says ff:hasChild is from Person to Person. So the deceased parent would have a hasChild pointing to the user. But since the user is the one submitting, perhaps the user has a deceased parent via ff:deceasedSpouse? Wait, the user could be the child of the deceased, so the deceased parent would have the user as their child. But how does the user reference the deceased parent?\n\nAlternatively, the user might be linked via relationships like ff:naturalChildTo (the user is the natural child of the deceased parent). So the user has a ff:naturalChildTo link to the deceased parent.\n\nWait, looking at the ontology:\n\nObjectProperty: ff:naturalChildTo\n    Domain: ff:Person\n    Range: ff:Person \n    Annotations: Links a person to their natural parent.\n\nSo, for example, if the user is a natural child of the deceased parent, then the user has a ff:naturalChildTo relationship pointing to the deceased parent. The deceased parent would be the one who died due to the accident, etc.\n\nTherefore, in SHACL, the user must have a naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, or fosterChildTo pointing to the deceased parent (or the deceased spouse if applicable, but the description mentions the deceased person in general).\n\nWait, the requirements mention \"die Person\" (the person who died due to the insured event). The user's relationship to that person must be as specified.\n\nSo first, there must exist a deceased person (e.g., parent or spouse?), but according to the text, the deceased is the person who had the insured event. The user's relation is as a child, stepchild, etc., of that deceased person.\n\nWait the first bullet points say:\n\n- leibliches Kind (biological child),\n- Stiefkind (stepchild) or Pflegekind (foster child) living in the same household and cared for,\n- Enkel (grandchild) or Geschwisterkind (sibling) living in the household and cared for,\n- or the deceased provided the main living expenses.\n\nSo the deceased person is the one who had the accident, etc. The user must be one of these relatives.\n\nThus, for the user to be eligible, they must have a relationship (ff:naturalChildTo, ff:stepChildTo, ff:fosterChildTo, etc.) to the deceased person (the one who died due to the event). Additionally, the deceased's causeOfDeath must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nTherefore, in SHACL:\n\n- The user must have a parent (via one of those relationships) who is deceased and whose causeOfDeath is one of the specified events.\n\nBut how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:deceasedSpouse? Wait no, the user is the child or other relative of the deceased, so the deceased is their parent, not their spouse.\n\nWait the description says \"die Person\" (the person who died due to the event). The user is the child, stepchild, etc., of that person. Therefore, the user's parent (or other relative) died due to the event.\n\nSo, the user must have a parent (via naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo) who has a causeOfDeath that is one of the events.\n\nAdditionally, for grandchildren or siblings:\n\n- The user is a grandchild: so the user's parent is a child of the deceased. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:hasChild or other relation pointing to them? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of inverse properties. Since in SHACL we can use inverse paths, but need to check if the ontology allows it.\n\nAlternatively, the user must be connected via one of these parent relations (naturalChildTo, etc.) to someone (the deceased) who has a causeOfDeath of the required type.\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL? Maybe using a path like:\n\nThe user's parent (via naturalChildTo) must have a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident, etc.\n\nWait, in SHACL, to express that the user has a natural parent (via naturalChildTo) who has a causeOfDeath that is an instance of one of the required event types.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path (ff:naturalChildTo ff:causeOfDeath);\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ];\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ];\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n    )\n  ]\n]\n\nBut we need to cover all possible relationships: naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo, and also grandchildren or siblings living in the household.\n\nWait, the second option is grandchildren or siblings who lived in the household and were cared for. So for siblings:\n\nThe user is a sibling of the deceased's child? Or the user is the sibling of the deceased?\n\nWait the description says: \"Enkel oder Geschwisterkind\" (grandchild or sibling's child?) or maybe \"Geschwisterkind\" is a typo for \"Geschwister\" (sibling)? The translation might be:\n\n- Grandchild or sibling (Geschwisterkind might mean sibling's child, but perhaps it's a sibling).\n\nAssuming it's grandchild or sibling:\n\nThe user must be a grandchild (child of the deceased's child) or a sibling (child of the same parent as the deceased). But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, the user must be a sibling of the deceased, and lived in the same household and was cared for. But the deceased is the one who died due to the event, so perhaps the user is a sibling of the deceased, and they lived in the deceased's household?\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Maybe the SHACL constraints need to be structured as follows:\n\nFirst, the deceased person (the one who died from the accident, etc.) must be related to the user in one of the specified ways:\n\nEither:\n\n- The user is a child (natural, step, foster) of the deceased, living in the household and cared for,\n\nOR\n\n- The user is a grandchild or sibling (of the deceased?) living in the household and cared for,\n\nOR\n\n- The deceased was the main provider for the user's living expenses.\n\nThis requires multiple conditions, which in SHACL can be expressed using sh:or and sh:and.\n\nLet me try to break down each condition.\n\n**First condition: User is a child (biological, step, foster) of the deceased, and lived in the household and was cared for.**\n\nThe user must have a relationship (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo) to the deceased (parent). Additionally, the user must have lived in the same household as the deceased and been cared for there. The ontology has ff:sameHouseholdAs, but perhaps the care is implied by the relationship? Not sure. The description says \"im Haushalt gelebt haben und dort versorgt und betreut wurden\".\n\nWait the ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold which links a CareNeed to a caregiver in the household. Maybe this isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the user's residence status or other properties indicate living in the same household.\n\nAlternatively, the ff:sameHouseholdAs property can be used between the user and the deceased's household member. But this might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the ontology doesn't have a direct property indicating living in the same household, perhaps we can ignore that part as ambiguous and focus on the relationship. The problem says to not model requirements that are ambiguous. The user must be a child (of the deceased) via one of the specified relationships. The \"living in the same household and cared for\" might be part of the relationship's definition, so perhaps we can assume that if they have the child relationship, those conditions are met. Or maybe the user must have the ff:sameHouseholdAs to the deceased? But the deceased is already dead, so maybe the user lived there before death?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but according to the problem statement, we shouldn't model ambiguous requirements. Since the ontology has ff:sameHouseholdAs between two Persons, perhaps the user must have ff:sameHouseholdAs with the deceased. But the deceased is no longer alive, so perhaps the user lived there before the death. But how to track that in the data?\n\nAlternatively, the description might just require the relationship (child) and not explicitly the household, but the problem says to model only clear requirements. Since the ontology doesn't have a clear property for that, maybe we can proceed with the relationship and ignore the household condition as ambiguous? The problem says not to model requirements that are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. So perhaps the household part is too vague without specific ontology terms, so we'll focus on the direct relationships.\n\nAlternatively, the \"im Haushalt gelebt haben\" might be inferred via the ff:sameHouseholdAs property between the user and the deceased. So the user must have a ff:sameHouseholdAs to the deceased.\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL?\n\nThe user has a deceased parent (natural, step, foster) and also is in the same household as them.\n\nWait but the deceased is dead, so the household relationship might be at the time of death. Since we can't track temporal data easily, perhaps the user's data includes that they lived in the same household as the deceased, represented via ff:sameHouseholdAs.\n\nThus, the first condition could be:\n\n- User has a ff:naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, or fosterChildTo to someone (the deceased parent),\n\nAND\n\n- User has ff:sameHouseholdAs to that parent (the deceased),\n\nAND\n\n- The deceased's causeOfDeath is one of the required events.\n\nBut how to structure this in SHACL? Since SHACL doesn't have loops, perhaps using a shape with multiple properties.\n\nAlternatively, using a path that goes through the parent to their causeOfDeath.\n\nWait, the user must have a parent (via the child relations) who has a causeOfDeath that's an accident, etc. So:\n\nFor the child relationship:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path (ff:naturalChildTo | ff:stepChildTo | ff:fosterChildTo) ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:node [\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ; sh:minCount 1 ] ; // Ensure there is a causeOfDeath\n    // Also, the deceased must be the person's parent\n  ]\n]\n\nBut also, the user must be in the same household as this parent (the deceased).\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Maybe breaking into multiple properties.\n\nAlternatively, for the first part (child of deceased with cause of death):\n\nThe user must have a parent (via one of the child relationships) who has a causeOfDeath that is one of the event types.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path (ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n  )\n]\n\nBut the path must be (ff:naturalChildTo | ff:stepChildTo | ff:fosterChildTo) / ff:causeOfDeath.\n\nSo combining the OR in the path:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( (ff:naturalChildTo | ff:stepChildTo | ff:fosterChildTo) / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n  )\n]\n\nThat would check if any of the user's natural/step/foster parents have a causeOfDeath of the required types.\n\nSimilarly for the grandchild or sibling case.\n\n**Second condition: Grandchild or sibling living in the same household and cared for.**\n\nFor grandchildren:\n\nThe user is a grandchild of the deceased (so their parent is the child of the deceased), and they lived in the deceased's household and were cared for.\n\nBut modeling this would require the user to have a parent who is a child (natural, step, foster) of the deceased, and the user lived in the deceased's household.\n\nAlternatively, the user must be a grandchild of the deceased (so the user has a grandparent who is the deceased), and the deceased's causeOfDeath is valid, and the user lived in the deceased's household.\n\nThis is getting too nested. Maybe the ontology doesn't have a direct property for grandchild, so this might be ambiguous. The problem states to not model ambiguous requirements. Since the ontology doesn't have a grandchild property (it has ff:naturalChildTo, but not grandchild), perhaps this condition can't be modeled directly, so we might have to exclude it? Or perhaps the user is a sibling of the deceased, which can be modeled via ff:closeRelative or another property.\n\nAlternatively, the user is a sibling of the deceased, which would be modeled via ff:closeRelative or another relationship. The ontology has ff:closeRelative as an object property from Person to Person, so maybe the user has a closeRelative (the deceased) and that deceased has the causeOfDeath.\n\nBut the user's sibling relationship to the deceased would require that the user and deceased share a parent. But without a direct sibling property, maybe using ff:closeRelative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is a child of the deceased's sibling, but this is getting too vague.\n\nSince the ontology may not have a direct way to express sibling or grandchild, and the problem says not to model ambiguous requirements, perhaps this part has to be omitted. Alternatively, maybe the user is a grandchild through a parent who is a child of the deceased, so:\n\nThe user has a parent who is a natural/step/foster child of the deceased, and the deceased's causeOfDeath is valid, and the user lived in the deceased's household.\n\nBut without a clear way to express this in SHACL due to ontology limitations, maybe this part is too ambiguous and thus excluded. The problem says to not model ambiguous requirements, so perhaps we proceed with only the child relationships and the main provider condition.\n\nAlternatively, the sibling case could be modeled via ff:hasChild from the deceased to the user's sibling, but it's unclear. Given the time constraints, perhaps I'll focus on the first part and the main provider condition.\n\n**Third condition: The deceased mainly covered the applicant's living expenses.**\n\nThe ontology has ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker, which links a person to their primary caregiver. If the deceased was the primary caregiver, then the user has ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker pointing to the deceased. But the deceased is dead, so maybe the user's primary caregiver before death was the deceased.\n\nAlternatively, the deceased was the main provider (ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker), and the user has that relationship.\n\nWait, the description says \"die verstorbene Person überwiegend für Ihren Lebensunterhalt aufgekommen ist.\" So the deceased mainly covered the user's living expenses.\n\nThe ontology has ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker which \"Links a person to a person who has the main responsibility for their living expenses.\" So if the deceased was the primary care taker, then the user's ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker is the deceased.\n\nThus, the user must have a ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker that is the deceased person, who also has a causeOfDeath of the required type.\n\nSo combining:\n\nThe user's hasPrimaryCareTaker must have a causeOfDeath that is one of the events.\n\nThus, in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n  )\n]\n\nBut also, the deceased must be the primary care taker.\n\nSo the user's primary care taker must have the required cause of death.\n\nNow, for the age condition: between 18 and 27, and meeting one of the three sub-conditions.\n\nThe age is handled via ff:hasAge, which is an integer. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n  sh:minInclusive 18 ;\n  sh:maxExclusive 27 ; // under 27, so less than 27\n]\n\nThen, one of the three sub-conditions must be true:\n\nEither:\n\n- In school or vocational training: user has ff:participates in a Training or School.\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:participates is from Person to Training, so:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:participates / ( a ff:School || a ff:VocationalTraining )) ;\n  sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nWait, the user must be participating in a School or VocationalTraining (since School is a subclass of Training).\n\nAlternatively, check if the user's participates is an instance of Training, but with the correct subclass.\n\nAlternatively, since School and VocationalTraining are both subclasses of Training, perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:School ] ;\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ]\n    )\n  ]\n]\n\nSecond sub-condition: can't support themselves due to disability.\n\nUser has a disability (ff:hasDisability is true) and the disability reduces work prospects permanently.\n\nThe ontology has ff:hasDisability (data property, boolean), and for the disability itself (if the user has a ff:hasDisabilityType, which is a disability class, then perhaps the disability's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true.\n\nWait, the description says \"wegen einer körperlichen, geistigen oder seelischen Behinderung nicht selbst für Ihren Unterhalt aufkommen\".\n\nThe ontology has ff:hasDisability (boolean), and also ff:hasDisabilityType (object property to Disability). The Disability class has a ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently (boolean). So the user must have a Disability that has that property true.\n\nThus, the user must have a hasDisabilityType that is a Disability (which it is by definition) and that Disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nBut also, the user must have ff:hasDisability = true.\n\nAlternatively, the ff:hasDisability is a data property that's true if the person has any disability. So combining:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n  sh:hasValue true\n],\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nThird sub-condition: in a transition period of up to 4 calendar months between education periods, after military service, or after voluntary service.\n\nThe ontology has ff:isInTransitionalPeriod (boolean), which is true if the person is in a transitional period of 4 months or less between educations or after military/community/voluntary service.\n\nThus, the user must have ff:isInTransitionalPeriod = true.\n\nSo, the age condition requires that the user's age is between 18 and 27, and one of the three sub-conditions (participates in education, disability with reduced prospects, or in transition).\n\nIn SHACL, this would be:\n\nsh:and (\n  [ sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:minInclusive 18 ;\n    sh:maxExclusive 27\n  ] ],\n  [ sh:or (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ( ff:participates / ( a ff:School || a ff:VocationalTraining )) ; sh:minCount 1 ] ],\n    [ sh:and (\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ] ],\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    ) ],\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n  ) ]\n)\n\nPutting all together, the SHACL shape would have multiple constraints:\n\n1. The user must be related to the deceased via child, primary caregiver, etc., with the deceased's causeOfDeath being an accident, etc.\n\n2. The age condition and one of the sub-conditions.\n\nNow, considering all these, I'll structure the SHACL shape.\n\nThe main shape will target ff:User and have a sh:or of the three main eligibility pathways (child, sibling/grandchild, or primary care).\n\nWait, the main pathways are:\n\nEither:\n\nA) User is a child (natural, step, foster) of the deceased and lived in the same household (but maybe that's ambiguous),\n\nB) User is a grandchild/sibling who lived in the household (but ambiguous),\n\nC) The deceased was the primary caregiver,\n\nOR any of these.\n\nAlternatively, the three main categories (child, grand/sibling, primary caregiver) are all part of the same condition.\n\nAlternatively, the first three bullet points are alternatives. The user must satisfy any one of the first three conditions (child, grand/sibling, or primary caregiver), plus the age condition (if applicable).\n\nWait the text says:\n\n\"Sie erhalten die Waisenrente als:\n\n* leibliches Kind, Stiefkind oder Pflegekind, wenn ... \n\n* Enkel oder Geschwisterkind, wenn ...\n\n* Sie können zudem die Waisenrente erhalten, wenn die ... Person ... (primary caregiver).\n\nUnter diesen Voraussetzungen erhalten Sie die Waisenrente auch dann, wenn Sie 18 bis 27 ...\"\n\nSo the first three conditions are alternatives for eligibility, and the age condition is an additional case where under the same conditions (the first three), they can also get it if between 18-27 and in school, disabled, etc.\n\nWait no, the age condition is part of the same eligibility. The user must meet one of the first three conditions, and if they are between 18-27, then they must also meet one of the three sub-conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the age condition is an additional requirement when applicable.\n\nSo overall, the user must:\n\nEither:\n\n1. Be a child (natural, step, foster) of the deceased who lived in the household and was cared for,\n\nOR\n\n2. Be a grandchild/sibling living in the household and cared for,\n\nOR\n\n3. The deceased was the primary caregiver,\n\nAND\n\nIf the user is between 18 and 27, they must also meet one of the three sub-conditions (school, disability, transition).\n\nWait the age condition is an add-on for those within that age range, but the main conditions (1-3) are separate. So the main conditions are necessary regardless of age. The age-based conditions are additional for that age group.\n\nTherefore, the overall SHACL shape should:\n\n- Enforce that the user is eligible via one of the main conditions (1-3).\n\n- Additionally, if the user is in 18-27, then the sub-conditions must be met.\n\nAlternatively, the age-based conditions are part of the same eligibility when applicable.\n\nLet me structure this as:\n\nThe user must satisfy at least one of the main conditions (child, grand/sibling, primary caregiver), and if they are between 18-27, they must also meet one of the sub-conditions.\n\nThus, in SHACL:\n\nsh:and (\n  [ sh:or (\n    [ // Child condition: natural, step, foster child with causeOfDeath\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ( (ff:naturalChildTo | ff:stepChildTo | ff:fosterChildTo) / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ]\n    ] ;\n    [ // Grandchild/sibling condition: assuming it's too ambiguous, perhaps excluded\n      // ... but perhaps modeled as sibling via closeRelative?\n      // If not possible, omit for now\n    ] ;\n    [ // Primary caregiver condition\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ]\n    ]\n  ) ],\n  [ // Age condition with sub-conditions if applicable\n    sh:xone (\n      [ // Under 18: no age condition needed, just main conditions\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n          sh:maxExclusive 18\n        ]\n      ] ;\n      [ // Between 18-27: must meet sub-conditions\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n          sh:minInclusive 18 ;\n          sh:maxExclusive 27\n        ] ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ // In education\n            sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:participates ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:node [\n                sh:or (\n                  [ sh:instanceOf ff:School ] ;\n                  [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ]\n                )\n              ]\n            ]\n          ] ;\n          [ // Disability\n            sh:and (\n              [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ] ],\n              [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ;\n                sh:hasValue true\n              ] ]\n            )\n          ] ;\n          [ // Transition period\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ]\n          ]\n        )\n      ] ;\n      [ // 27 or older: no age condition (but main conditions still must hold)\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n          sh:minInclusive 27\n        ]\n      ]\n    )\n  ]\n)\n\nWait, but the xone ensures exactly one of the age ranges is true. This way, the user is either under 18, between 18-27 (with sub-conditions), or 27+.\n\nAlternatively, the age can be unrestricted but for those in 18-27, the sub-conditions are required.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nPutting this all together into SHACL:\n\nThe target node is ff:User.\n\nStart with the main shape:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:WaisenrenteShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:or (\n      # Condition 1: Child of deceased with valid cause\n      [ sh:path ( (ff:naturalChildTo | ff:stepChildTo | ff:fosterChildTo) / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ] ;\n      # Condition 3: Primary caregiver (deceased) had valid cause\n      [ sh:path ( ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  sh:xone (\n    # Age under 18: no further conditions needed\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ] ] ;\n    # Age 18-27: must meet one of the sub-conditions\n    [ sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 18 ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 27\n      ] ;\n      sh:or (\n        # In education (School or VocationalTraining)\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:participates ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:node [\n              sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:School ] ;\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ]\n              )\n            ]\n          ]\n        ] ;\n        # Disability reducing work prospects permanently\n        [ sh:and (\n          [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ;\n          [ sh:property [\n              sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ;\n              sh:hasValue true\n            ]\n          ]\n        ) ] ;\n        # In transition period\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      )\n    ] ;\n    # 27 or older: no extra conditions\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 27 ] ]\n  )\n.\n\nWait but this excludes the grandchild/sibling condition. Since the ontology might not have a direct way to express that, and the problem says to omit ambiguous requirements, it's better to exclude it unless I can find a way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grandchild/sibling can be modeled via ff:hasChild or another property.\n\nThe user being a grandchild means the user's parent is a child of the deceased. So the user has a parent (ff:naturalChildTo, etc., of the deceased's child), but this requires knowing that the deceased has a child who is the user's parent.\n\nThis is too nested for SHACL without a clear path. Hence, omitting it as ambiguous.\n\nSo the main conditions are the first and third (child and primary caregiver).\n\nThus, the above SHACL should work.\n\nNow, verifying all data properties:\n\n- For the disability part, the user must have ff:hasDisability true, and their disability (via hasDisabilityType) must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n\n- For the primary caregiver's causeOfDeath, the path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker/ff:causeOfDeath must be one of the events.\n\n- The age conditions are handled with hasAge.\n\nThis should cover the requirements without using terms outside the ontology.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:WaisenrenteShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:or (\n      # Condition 1: Child of deceased with valid cause of death\n      [ sh:path ( (ff:naturalChildTo | ff:stepChildTo | ff:fosterChildTo) / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ] ;\n      # Condition 3: Deceased primary caregiver with valid cause of death\n      [ sh:path ( ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n          [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  sh:xone (\n    # Under 18: No additional requirements\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ] ] ;\n    # 18–27: Must meet one of the sub-conditions\n    [ sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 18 ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 27\n      ] ;\n      sh:or (\n        # In school or vocational training\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:participates ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:node [\n              sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:School ] ;\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ]\n              )\n            ]\n          ]\n        ] ;\n        # Permanently reduced work prospects due to disability\n        [ sh:and (\n          [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ;\n          [ sh:property [\n              sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ;\n              sh:hasValue true\n            ]\n          ]\n        ) ] ;\n        # In transitional period ≤4 months\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      )\n    ] ;\n    # 27 or older: No additional requirements\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 27 ] ]\n  )\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Einstiegsgeld' benefit. First, I need to understand the requirements given in the text and map them to the provided ontology. \n\nThe benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102713860, but looking at the ontology, there's an individual B100019_LB_102716305 labeled as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\", which might be a typo, but maybe the user just wants the shape for the given description regardless. Wait, the user's text mentions 'Einstiegsgeld' with IDLB B100019_LB_102713860, but that exact ID isn't in the ontology. Hmm, maybe the exact ID isn't crucial as long as the shape targets the User node. The important part is the conditions.\n\nThe main conditions are:\n\n1. Received Bürgergeld before starting the new activity. Arbeitslosigkeit isn't required. So, the user must have received Bürgergeld (which is B100019_LB_106311931 in the ontology) before starting. Need to check if the user has a receivedBenefit link to that benefit.\n\n2. Application must be submitted before starting the activity. But how to represent that in SHACL? Since SHACL validates existing data, maybe the user's RDF data should have an application node with a date before the start date. But the ontology doesn't have an application property. Maybe this condition can't be modeled directly as it's about the application timing, not the user's data. The user might not have a property for application date, so perhaps exclude this as per the rules.\n\n3. The new self-employment or job must be suitable to overcome help dependency. So, the user's new activity (Employment?) must have some property indicating this. The ontology has ff:participates for training, but maybe for employment, there's no direct property. Alternatively, maybe the evaluation by the Jobcenter is needed. Since the additional condition mentions Jobcenter's positive assessment, perhaps the user must have a property like hasEarningCapacity with some status? Not sure. The ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause, but that's for needing support. Maybe this is too vague and can't be modeled, so skip.\n\n4. The benefit is necessary for integration into the labor market. Again, this might be a subjective assessment, so can't be directly checked via SHACL constraints unless there's a flag. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for this, maybe it's excluded.\n\n5. The employment must be at least 15 hours/week. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on ff:Employment. So the user's employment (via ff:hasEmployment) must have workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAdditional conditions for self-employment:\n\n- Positive evaluation by Jobcenter on personal suitability and economic viability. Again, unless there's a property like ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency (which is for training), maybe this can't be directly modeled. The ontology has ff:participates in a Training commissioned by EmploymentAgency, but for self-employment, perhaps there's no such property. Since the user can't model this unless there's a data property indicating approval, maybe this is not possible. So exclude as per the rules about not modeling ambiguous requirements.\n\nNow, focusing on what can be modeled:\n\n- The user must have received Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931) via ff:receivedBenefit.\n\n- Their current employment (ff:hasEmployment) must have workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAdditionally, check if the user is not already receiving the benefit (to avoid duplicates?), but the requirement doesn't mention that. \n\nAlso, the requirement says \"Arbeitslosigkeit is no prerequisite\", so maybe they can have employment but still qualify. Wait, the first condition says they received Bürgergeld before starting the new activity. So the user might have been on Bürgergeld and now starting a job that meets the hours.\n\nThe SHACL shape should target ff:User, so the shape's target is ff:User.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- must have a receivedBenefit link to Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931).\n\n- must have an employment (via ff:hasEmployment) where the employment's workHoursPerWeek is >=15.\n\nWait, the new activity is either self-employment or employment. The ontology has ff:EmploymentStatus including SelfEmployed and others. But the ff:hasEmployment property's range is ff:Employment, which might not include self-employment. Wait, the ontology's ff:EmploymentStatus includes SelfEmployed as an individual. So perhaps the user's EmploymentStatus must be SelfEmployed or another employment, but the hours are still required.\n\nAlternatively, the new activity could be self-employment, but the ontology might not have a specific property for that. The ff:EmploymentStatus has SelfEmployed as a type, so perhaps the user's hasEmploymentStatus must be SelfEmployed or RegisteredUnemployed? Not sure. But the main thing is the hours.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\nFor the main conditions:\n\n1. receivedBenefit includes B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n\n2. hasEmployment's workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAdditional constraints for self-employment might not be modelable, so focus on the main ones.\n\nNow, writing the SHACL:\n\nThe shape should be for the User node, so starting with a shape that targets ff:User.\n\nFirst, the Bürgergeld condition:\n\nA user must have at least one receivedBenefit that is B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nIn SHACL, that would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivedBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ff:B100019_LB_106311931;  // Wait, but receivedBenefit is an object property, so the value must be an individual of SocialBenefit. So the value should be exactly the individual B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:hasValue:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivedBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n]\n\nWait no, because the user might have multiple received benefits, but at least one must be Bürgergeld. So the path ff:receivedBenefit should have at least one value that is exactly that individual.\n\nSo using sh:hasValue with sh:in? Or sh:property with sh:hasValue?\n\nWait, sh:hasValue requires that all values match, but we need at least one. So better to use sh:property with sh:hasValue and sh:minCount 1.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivedBenefit;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nBut that would mean all receivedBenefit must be that, which isn't right. Instead, we need that at least one of the receivedBenefit is that. So perhaps using sh:or with a sh:property that includes that. Alternatively, using a SPARQL constraint. But since the user requires SHACL Core only.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:qualifiedMinCount with sh:qualifiedValuesConstraint:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivedBenefit;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValues [\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n    ];\n]\n\nYes, that's the right way. So that at least one of the receivedBenefit must be exactly that individual.\n\nThen the employment hours:\n\nThe user must have an employment (via ff:hasEmployment) where the employment's workHoursPerWeek is >=15.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n    sh:minInclusive 15;\n]\n\nWait, but the path is ff:hasEmployment (which is an object property to Employment), then within Employment, the data property ff:workHoursPerWeek.\n\nSo the path would be ff:hasEmployment/(ff:workHoursPerWeek).\n\nIn SHACL path syntax: ff:hasEmployment/(ff:workHoursPerWeek)\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasEmployment ; sh:followedBy ff:workHoursPerWeek ];\n    sh:minInclusive 15;\n    sh:minCount 1;  // must have at least one employment with that\n]\n\nWait, maybe better:\n\nThe user must have at least one Employment via hasEmployment, and that Employment must have workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nSo the property path is ff:hasEmployment/(ff:workHoursPerWeek), and the value must be >=15, and there must be at least one such.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n    sh:minInclusive 15;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with path ff:hasEmployment and then a nested property for workHoursPerWeek. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the shape could have two properties:\n\nFirst, the receivedBenefit check.\n\nSecond, for the employment hours:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n        sh:minInclusive 15;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n    ];\n]\n\nBut I think the path composition is better.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EinstiegsgeldShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Received Bürgergeld before\n        sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Employment hours >=15\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n.\n\nWait, but the path for the workHoursPerWeek is ff:hasEmployment followed by ff:workHoursPerWeek. The path expression in SHACL would be written as ff:hasEmployment/(ff:workHoursPerWeek), so in Turtle:\n\nsh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasEmployment ; sh:followedBy ff:workHoursPerWeek ] ?\n\nWait, no. The path is from the user to Employment via hasEmployment, then within Employment, to workHoursPerWeek. So the path is ff:hasEmployment followed by ff:workHoursPerWeek. In SHACL, the path is written as a sequence. The correct way is using the path expression:\n\n(ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek)\n\nIn Turtle, that's represented using a list. So:\n\nsh:path ( ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek )\n\nBut in Turtle syntax, it would be:\n\nsh:path [ \n    sh:inversePath ff:hasEmployment ; \n    sh:followedBy ff:workHoursPerWeek \n]\n\nWait, no. The correct way is using SHACL's path expressions. Let me recall the SHACL spec:\n\nThe path can be a sequence using the '/' operator. So the path is ff:hasEmployment followed by ff:workHoursPerWeek. So in Turtle, using the path expression as a list:\n\nsh:path ( ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek )\n\nThus the property becomes:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek );\n    sh:minInclusive 15;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nWait, but sh:minCount 1 here would require that the user has at least one Employment with workHoursPerWeek existing and >=15. That's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe shape is named, targets User, has two properties. The first checks receivedBenefit includes Bürgergeld, the second checks employment hours.\n\nNow, also need to ensure that the shape is properly defined.\n\nAnother thing: the user must have an Employment. So maybe also require that hasEmployment has at least one value?\n\nThe second property's path is hasEmployment/workHoursPerWeek. So if the user has no Employment, that path would have no values. The sh:minCount 1 would require that at least one exists. But if they have Employment but workHoursPerWeek <15, it would fail. So that's okay.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EinstiegsgeldShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Received Bürgergeld before starting the new activity\n        sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;  # Bürgergeld\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Employment must be at least 15 hours/week\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek ) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the 'Kinderzuschlag' (Child Supplement) based on the provided conditions. Let me start by understanding each requirement and mapping them to the ontology.\n\nFirst, the target is the node \"ff:User\". The SHACL graph must validate if the user meets all the criteria.\n\nThe first condition: The children must be under 25, not married/partnered, and living in the same household. \n\n- For the age under 25: The ontology has ff:hasAge (xsd:int). So, for each child (related via ff:receivesChildBenefitFor), their age should be < 25.\n- Not married or in a civil union: The marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) of the child should not be Married or CivilUnion. The ontology has ff:MaritalStatus instances like Married and CivilUnion.\n- Living in the same household: The child must be connected via ff:sameHouseholdAs to the user.\n\nSecond condition: Receiving child benefit (Kindergeld) or equivalent. The user must have ff:receivesChildBenefitFor each child, which implies they receive Kindergeld. Alternatively, an equivalent from abroad might need checking, but the ontology doesn't have a direct property for that. Maybe ff:hasIncome with a different benefit? Since it's ambiguous, maybe just check for Kindergeld as per the ontology's ff:B100019_LB_576986 (Child allowance) which is Kindergeld. So the user must have ff:receivesBenefit linked to ff:B100019_LB_576986 for each child.\n\nThird condition: Income thresholds. \n\n- As a couple: Family gross income ≥ 900 EUR/month. The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome in ff:Income. So, the user's income (ff:hasIncome) must have familyGrossIncome ≥ 900 if they're part of a couple.\n- Single parent: Personal gross income ≥ 600 EUR. The user's income's personalGrossIncome should be ≥600 if they're a single parent (ff:isSingleParent is a data property).\n\nFourth: Income不算太高导致补贴为零。需要计算后是否符合条件。可能需要比较收入和其他因素，但SHACL可能无法直接计算，所以可能需要检查是否满足某个条件，比如是否有某个数据属性标记是否符合。但根据给定的数据属性，可能没有直接对应项。这里可能需要忽略，或者假设用户的数据有对应的属性，比如是否超过某个阈值。或者可能这个条件需要通过其他属性间接满足，比如canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit为true？\n\nFifth: No considerable assets (ff:hasConsiderableAssets must be false).\n\nSixth: The combined income with others can cover family needs. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit as a data property. This should be true.\n\nSeventh: Kinderzuschlag is subordinate to other income of the child. Need to ensure the user doesn't have priority claims over this benefit. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to the benefit (B100019_LB_581863). So the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to the child supplement.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User. Each condition becomes a constraint.\n\nFirst condition for children:\n\n- For each child (ff:receivesChildBenefitFor), check their age, marital status, and household.\n\nBut in SHACL, this might require a nested shape for the children. However, since SHACL Core doesn't support nested shapes easily, maybe using sh:property with sh:node and sh:shape.\n\nAlternatively, for each child, we can have constraints:\n\nBut perhaps it's better to structure it as:\n\nThe user must have at least one child (ff:receivesChildBenefitFor), and each such child must satisfy the age, marital status, and household conditions.\n\nSo:\n\n- sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor; sh:minCount 1 ].\n\nThen, for each child (path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor), their age must be <25 (using sh:property with path ff:hasAge, sh:maxInclusive 24).\n\nBut how to express that all children meet this? Using sh:each with a shape.\n\nWait, SHACL's sh:each can apply a shape to each member of a list. So:\n\nFor the children (ff:receivesChildBenefitFor), each must have:\n\n- hasAge < 25 (so sh:maxInclusive 24)\n- marital status not Married or CivilUnion (sh:hasMaritalStatus is not in (Married, CivilUnion))\n- sameHouseholdAs user (so the child has a relationship with the user via sameHouseholdAs)\n\nBut how to express sameHouseholdAs? The child must have a relationship where they are in the same household as the user. Since the user is the current node, maybe:\n\nThe child must be connected via ff:sameHouseholdAs to the user. So in the shape for the child, the path ff:sameHouseholdAs should have the user as the value.\n\nBut in SHACL, to express that for each child, there exists a sameHouseholdAs link to the user:\n\nMaybe using sh:property with sh:hasValue ? But since the user is the current node, perhaps using sh:property with sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs and sh:someValuesFrom [ sh:include sh:currentNode ].\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property and sh:node with a shape that requires sameHouseholdAs to include the user.\n\nThis might get complex. Alternatively, maybe the ontology's ff:sameHouseholdAs is sufficient as a direct property between child and user.\n\nSo for each child, the shape would include:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:User;  // Not sure if this is possible since ff:User is the current node.\n]\n\nWait, but the current node is the user. So the child must have a sameHouseholdAs link to the user. So the path for the child's ff:sameHouseholdAs should have the user as a value. But in SHACL, how to reference the current node?\n\nHmm, perhaps this is tricky. Maybe instead, the user must have a sameHouseholdAs relationship with the child. Since the user is the subject, but the property is on the child. So maybe this requires a more complex path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is that the child is in the same household as the user, which is captured by the child having a sameHouseholdAs link to the user. So in the shape for the child, the ff:sameHouseholdAs should be the user.\n\nBut since the user is the current node (ff:User), perhaps using a path like:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:sameHouseholdAs ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nWait, using inverse path. The user should have at least one sameHouseholdAs link to the child, but the property is on the child. So the child's ff:sameHouseholdAs must include the user.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a reverse link via sameHouseholdAs to each child. But I'm not sure how to express that in SHACL.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is that the child is linked via sameHouseholdAs to the user. Since the child is the object of the sameHouseholdAs property, the user must be the subject. So for each child (which is the object), the user must have sameHouseholdAs pointing to them? Or the child has sameHouseholdAs pointing to the user.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Perhaps the ontology's ff:sameHouseholdAs is from the person to another person, so the child has ff:sameHouseholdAs to the user.\n\nTherefore, in the child's shape, the path ff:sameHouseholdAs must have the user as one of the values.\n\nBut in SHACL, how do we reference the current user node in the shape applied to the child? Maybe using sh:currentNode.\n\nSo for the child's shape:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs;\n  sh:hasValue sh:currentNode;  // The user is the current node, so this would check if the child's sameHouseholdAs includes the current user.\n]\n\nYes, that could work. So the child's shape would require that their sameHouseholdAs includes the current node (the user).\n\nSimilarly, the marital status must not be Married or CivilUnion. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus;\n  sh:not [\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ]\n      [ sh:hasValue ff:CivilUnion ]\n    )\n  ]\n]\n\nOr maybe using sh:disjoint (not sure). Alternatively, sh:hasValue must not be in those instances.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus;\n  sh:nodeKind sh:IRI;\n  sh:hasValue [ sh:disjoint ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ]\n]\n\nNot sure. Maybe better to use sh:hasValue for each prohibited value and combine with sh:not.\n\nPutting it all together for the children's shape:\n\nEach child (via ff:receivesChildBenefitFor) must have:\n\n- hasAge <25\n- sameHouseholdAs includes user (current node)\n- marital status is not Married or CivilUnion\n\nThen, the user must have at least one child meeting these.\n\nNext, the second condition: receiving Kindergeld or equivalent. The user must have a receivesBenefit link to the Kindergeld benefit (B100019_LB_576986) for each child? Or for at least one? The text says \"für Ihr Kind/Ihre Kinder\" so probably each child must have it. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986;  // Kindergeld\n]\n\nWait, but the user must be receiving Kindergeld for each child, so maybe the path is ff:receivesChildBenefitFor (the children) and each child has a parent receiving Kindergeld? Not sure. Alternatively, the user has a ff:receivesBenefit for the Kindergeld, but that might not link to the child. The ontology's ff:receivesChildBenefitFor links the user to the child for which they receive child benefit. Maybe the Kindergeld is received via that?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a receivesBenefit linked to the Kindergeld individual (B100019_LB_576986). So:\n\nThe user must have ff:receivesBenefit with the value B100019_LB_576986.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986\n]\n\nThird condition: income thresholds.\n\nThe user's income must meet either:\n\n- As a couple: familyGrossIncome >= 900\n- As single parent: personalGrossIncome >=600\n\nSo first, determine if the user is part of a couple or a single parent.\n\nThe ontology has a data property ff:isSingleParent (xsd:boolean). So:\n\nIf isSingleParent is true, then personalGrossIncome must be >=600.\n\nElse, familyGrossIncome must be >=900.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with sh:or and sh:property with sh:qualifiedMinInclusive.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or between two cases.\n\nThe shape could have:\n\nsh:or (\n  [ \n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isSingleParent;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:personalGrossIncome ];\n      sh:minInclusive 600\n    ]\n  ]\n  [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:isSingleParent;\n      sh:hasValue false;\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:familyGrossIncome ];\n      sh:minInclusive 900\n    ]\n  ]\n)\n\nWait, but the path for the income might be more complex. The user has ff:hasIncome which is an Income instance. Then, familyGrossIncome is a data property of that Income.\n\nSo, the path would be ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome. Similarly for personalGrossIncome.\n\nTherefore, the paths would be:\n\nFor familyGrossIncome: [ sh:inversePath [ sh:propertyPath ( ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome ) ] ]\n\nWait, perhaps using a path like:\n\nsh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:familyGrossIncome ]\n\nSo the entire constraint for the income would be an sh:or between the two cases.\n\nFourth condition: Income不算太高导致补贴为零. The user's income shouldn't be so high that the child supplement is reduced to zero. The ontology has a data property ff:reducesChildSupplementTo on the Income, which gives the remaining amount. So, the value should be >0.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ];\n  sh:minInclusive 0.0001  // assuming it can't be exactly zero\n]\n\nBut the exact property might be that reducesChildSupplementTo is greater than zero. So:\n\nsh:minInclusive 0.0001 (or 0.01?), but perhaps the ontology expects that if it's zero, then the supplement is null, so the user must have that value >0.\n\nFifth condition: no considerable assets. So ff:hasConsiderableAssets must be false.\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets;\n  sh:hasValue false\n]\n\nSixth condition: can cover family needs with the combined income etc. So ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is true.\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit;\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nSeventh condition: no priority claims. The user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to the child supplement (B100019_LB_581863).\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863\n]\n\nPutting all these together into the SHACL shape.\n\nNow, structuring the Turtle code.\n\nStart with the shape for the user:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n\n:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path rdf:type ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Person ;\n  ] ;\n  # Child conditions\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:each [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive 24 ;  # under 25\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue sh:currentNode ;  # current node is the user\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n          sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ]\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:CivilUnion ]\n          )\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  # Receives Kindergeld\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986 ;\n  ] ;\n  # Income conditions\n  sh:or (\n    # Case 1: Single parent\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:personalGrossIncome ] ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n    # Case 2: Paar\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:familyGrossIncome ] ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n  ) ;\n  # Income not so high that supplement is zero\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ ff:hasIncome / ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ] ;\n    sh:minInclusive 0.0001 ;  # assuming it can't be exactly zero\n  ] ;\n  # No considerable assets\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n    sh:hasValue false ;\n  ] ;\n  # Can cover basic needs\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n  # No priority claims\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n  ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the path for ff:hasIncome/ff:personalGrossIncome would be expressed as a path. The path for the personalGrossIncome would be:\n\nsh:path [ sh:propertyPath ( ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome ) ]\n\nSimilarly for familyGrossIncome.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that the user has an income instance. But maybe the hasIncome is already required.\n\nAlso, the ff:receivesChildBenefitFor must link to the children, which are the same as in the other conditions.\n\nAlso, the marital status of the child must not be Married or CivilUnion. The current code checks the child's hasMaritalStatus, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the condition says the child is not verheiratet oder verpartnert, which corresponds to Married or CivilUnion. So the not condition is correct.\n\nFor the income thresholds, the user must have either case. The sh:or is correct.\n\nThe 'reducesChildSupplementTo' must be greater than 0. Using sh:minInclusive 0.0001 might be okay.\n\nNow, check if all required ontology terms are used, and no extra terms.\n\nYes, seems okay. Now, converting this into proper Turtle syntax with proper prefixes and escaping.\n\nWait, the SHACL shape uses sh:currentNode for the sameHouseholdAs condition. That should work as it refers to the current node being validated (the user).\n\nAlso, the sh:or includes two NodeShapes for the different cases.\n\nI think this should cover all the conditions specified.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n\n:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path rdf:type ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Person ;\n  ] ;\n  # Children eligibility criteria\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:each [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive 24 ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue sh:currentNode ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n          sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ]\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:CivilUnion ]\n          )\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  # Child benefit (Kindergeld) requirement\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986 ;\n  ] ;\n  # Income thresholds (as couple vs. single parent)\n  sh:or (\n    # Single parent case\n    [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:propertyPath ( ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome ) ] ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n    # Couple case\n    [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:propertyPath ( ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome ) ] ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n      ]\n    ]\n  ) ;\n  # Income not reducing child supplement to zero\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:propertyPath ( ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ) ] ;\n    sh:minInclusive \"0.0001\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n  ] ;\n  # No considerable assets\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n    sh:hasValue false ;\n  ] ;\n  # Family needs covered by income/resources\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n  # No priority claims over this benefit\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the Bürgergeld (Citizen Benefit) based on the given conditions. Let me start by parsing the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the target is the \"User\" node, so all shapes should target that. Let me look at each condition:\n\n1. **Erwerbsfähig (Employable):**\n   - At least 3 hours of work per day. The ontology has ff:employableHoursPerDay as a data property. So I need a constraint that this value must be >= 3.0.\n   - At least 15 years old: Use ff:hasAge ≥ 15.\n   - Not reached the legal retirement age (isPensionable is false). The ontology has ff:isPensionable, so the value must be false.\n   - The retirement age depends on birth year, but since the user's age is checked, maybe we can just use the isPensionable flag here. The exact age calculation might not be in the ontology, so better stick to the flag.\n\n2. **Hilfebedürftig (Needy):**\n   - Cannot cover basic needs for themselves and non-erwerbsfähige family. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit which must be false. This property is on the Person, so that's straightforward.\n\n3. **No prior claims (no priority benefits):**\n   - The user must not have priority claims over other benefits. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, but it's a object property linking to the SocialBenefit. Since the requirement is about not having any such claims, maybe the shape needs to ensure that for the current benefit (Bürgergeld), the user doesn't have other priority benefits. Alternatively, maybe the user must not have any of the priority benefits listed (like Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag). Wait, the requirement says \"no priority claims over other beneficiaries or persons\". The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which points to a SocialBenefit. So perhaps the user must not have any such links. Hmm, maybe better to check that for each of the priority benefits (like Arbeitslosengeld etc.), the user isn't receiving them. Alternatively, maybe the user must have ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit as false, which already implies that. Not sure. The text says \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern\", so maybe the user must not be receiving any of those benefits. So perhaps, for each of those benefits (Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag), the user should not be receiving them. So for example, ff:receivesBenefit should not include those. But how to model that in SHACL? Maybe using a shape that excludes those via a property path with a negation. Alternatively, use a SPARQL-based constraint, but since we have to use SHACL Core, maybe it's better to check that the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false, which might already encapsulate that. Alternatively, the condition might be covered by the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. Let me check the ontology: ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is a boolean indicating if they can cover needs with their income/assets and priority benefits. So if that's false, it means they can't, so they must not have those benefits, or the benefits are insufficient. Maybe the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false is sufficient here. So perhaps the \"no priority claims\" is redundant because if they can't cover it with those, then they must not have them or they are insufficient. Hmm, maybe the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false is the right property to check here. So the second condition's main check is canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false.\n\n4. **Living in Germany:**\n   - The countryOfResidence must be Germany (ff:Germany). So ff:countryOfResidence should be exactly <https://foerderfunke.org/default#Germany>.\n\nNow, putting all these into SHACL shapes:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User, so the targetClass is ff:User. Each condition is a constraint.\n\nLet me structure the SHACL:\n\nStart with the base shape for the User:\n\n:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3.0\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] ;\n.\n\nWait, but for the retirement age, the user must not have reached it. The isPensionable is a boolean; so if it's false, that's correct. So that's handled.\n\nWait, but the age part: the user must be at least 15 years old (hasAge >=15) and not have reached the pensionable age (so isPensionable is false). So those two are separate checks.\n\nAre there any other constraints?\n\nThe problem mentions \"mindestens 15 Jahre alt sind und die Altersgrenze der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung noch nicht erreicht haben\". So the two conditions are age >=15 and not yet at pensionable age. The ontology's isPensionable is whether they have reached the legal retirement age, so yes.\n\nSo all the above constraints are covered.\n\nNow, check for other possible requirements. The user must also not have any priority claims. The ontology has the property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links to a SocialBenefit. The requirement says they must have no such claims. So perhaps, the user should not have any ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver properties. Wait, actually the wording says \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern\", which might mean they shouldn't have any other benefits with higher priority. The ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver would point to a benefit for which they have no claims. Hmm, maybe I need to check that they don't have any other benefits that are considered priority. Alternatively, the user must not be receiving any of the priority benefits (Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag). Since the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is already false, that implies that even with those benefits, they can't cover their needs, but maybe the requirement also explicitly excludes having those benefits. Wait the text says \"können ... nicht bestreiten können aus ... vorrangigen Leistungen (zum Beispiel Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag)\". So the user can't cover the needs even with those benefits. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false would imply that. So perhaps that's sufficient. Therefore, maybe the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is not needed here. The main check is canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false. So I think we don't need to add anything else for that part.\n\nAnother point: the user must not have any priority claims over other beneficiaries or persons like ex-partners or parents. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they must not have any of those relationships. The exact requirement is a bit ambiguous, but since the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is already considered, perhaps that's sufficient. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for that, maybe it's better to leave it out unless it's explicitly covered. Since the user must not have any priority claims, maybe they must not have ff:receivesBenefit linked to any of the priority benefits. But how to express that in SHACL without SPARQL? Since SHACL Core doesn't have negation, perhaps it's better to rely on the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false, which already captures that they can't cover needs even with those benefits. So maybe that's sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the main constraints are:\n\n- hasAge >=15\n- employableHoursPerDay >=3.0\n- isPensionable = false\n- canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit = false\n- countryOfResidence is Germany\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL accordingly. Also, ensure that all properties are from the given ontology.\n\nChecking the ontology:\n\n- ff:hasAge is a data property of Person, correct.\n- ff:employableHoursPerDay is a data property, correct.\n- ff:isPensionable is a data property, correct.\n- ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is a data property, correct.\n- ff:countryOfResidence is an object property with range Country, and ff:Germany is an individual of Country.\n\nThus, the SHACL should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3.0\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' benefit (IDLB B100019_LB_574724) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be a person (ff:User), so the SHACL shapes will target that node.\n\nThe conditions are divided into sections: eligible person, eligible training, and additional for preparatory measures and abroad training.\n\nStarting with the eligible person:\n\n1. Wohnen nicht bei Eltern und Ausbildungsbetrieb ist zu weit weg, oder Alter mindestens 18, verheiratet, oder hat Kind bei sich.\n   - Need to check if they live with parents and the address is too far. Or if they are 18+, married, or have a child living with them.\n   - Use ff:parentalAdress and ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany. If they have a parental address and it's too far, that's okay. Alternatively, if they are over 18, or have a marital status of Married, or have a child (ff:hasChild).\n\n2. Nicht Deutscher: Anspruch besteht, außer Asylgesetz Aufenthaltsgestattung oder geduldet mit <15 Monaten Aufenthalt.\n   - Check if they are not German (ff:isNationalOf not Germany). But must not have ff:hasAsylumActPermit (Asylgesetz) or (if residence status is Tolerated (ff:Tolerated) AND ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months is true).\n\n3. Keine Mittel für Lebensunterhalt, Fahrtkosten, etc. So they can't cover these costs. The property ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit should be false, but need to ensure it's about their own needs and the required costs. Alternatively, maybe ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false? Wait, the text says \"können nicht die erforderlichen Mittel aufbringen, um folgende Kosten zu decken: Lebensunterhalt, Fahrtkosten, Familienheimfahrten, Arbeitskleidung, Kinderbetreuungskosten\". This seems to be about their inability to cover these specific costs. But in the ontology, the relevant properties might be ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit or similar. Let me check the ontology again. The DataProperty ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is \"True if a person can cover the basic needs of themselves and the unemployed individuals in their benefit unit with their income, assets, and priority benefits, false otherwise.\" Hmm, maybe that's not exactly the same. Alternatively, maybe the user must have ff:hasIncome with certain properties, but perhaps it's better to model it as the inverse: they cannot cover those costs, so the condition would be that ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false? Wait, another DataProperty is ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds, which is \"True if a person can cover their personal basic needs with their income, assets, and priority benefits, false otherwise.\" So if they cannot cover those, then this should be false. However, the exact requirements might need to include all those specific costs, but since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for each, maybe we have to use the available ones. The problem is that the user must not have the means to cover those costs. Since the ontology includes ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds (which might include some of these), but the exact mapping is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the condition is that their income and assets are insufficient. Since there's a property ff:hasConsiderableAssets (if true, they have considerable assets), so if that is false, they don't. But the text says they cannot cover the costs, so perhaps the condition is that they do not have considerable assets (i.e., ff:hasConsiderableAssets is false). Alternatively, maybe there's another property. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be able to cover their basic needs, so ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false. Let's go with that for now, but note that this might need adjustment if the ontology properties don't exactly match.\n\nNext, the training must be eligible:\n\n- First vocational training or, if not first, they can't be integrated otherwise.\n  - Check if the training is their first (ff:isFirstVocationalTraining is true). OR if not, then they must have a disability that permanently reduces work prospects (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a Disability with ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true).\n\n- The training must be recognized under the VocationalTrainingAct, CraftsCode, MaritimeLabourAct, or NursingProfessionsAct (part 2). So the training must have ff:recognizedByLaw linked to one of these laws.\n\n- They must have a vocational training contract (ff:subjectToContract linked to VocationalTrainingContract).\n\nFor people with disabilities:\n\n- The training can be an exception (ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to Disability) OR they need to repeat due to disability, or live with parents (even if under 18?).\n\nWait, the text says: \"wenn Sie eine Berufsausbildung machen, die abweichend von den Ausbildungsordnungen für staatlich anerkannte Ausbildungsberufe oder in Sonderformen für behinderte Menschen durchgeführt wird, Sie Ihre Ausbildung verlängern müssen, Sie die Ausbildung aufgrund Ihrer Behinderung ganz oder teilweise wiederholen und eine dauerhafte Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben sonst nicht möglich wäre oder Sie im Haushalt der Eltern oder eines Elternteils wohnen.\"\n\nSo for disabled persons, the training can be done in a different way (so ruleExemptionBecause exists?), or they must extend/repeat the training, and without this, they can't participate in work. Or they live with parents (even if under 18?).\n\nHmm, this is a bit complex. Maybe:\n\n- The training has ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to a Disability, OR (they have a Disability and need to repeat/extend the training because of it, leading to permanent work prospects reduction) OR they live with parents (even if under 18, but then the first condition about living with parents and distance might be overridden?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe for disabled persons, the training must have a rule exemption or they must live with parents (regardless of age), but this needs to be modeled as an OR condition.\n\nAdditionally, for preparatory measures: must be commissioned by the agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true).\n\nTraining abroad:\n\n- Partial abroad: duration ≤1 year (ff:monthsAbroad ≤12), and the part abroad is appropriate relative to total duration (maybe ff:percentAbroad <=50%? Or another way to model 'angemessen'? Since the ontology has percentAbroad, maybe ≤50%?)\n\n- Full abroad: must be equivalent to German training (ff:recognizedByLaw with some condition?), and beneficial for their career goal.\n\nWait, the text says for full abroad training: \"amtlich bestätigt wird, dass die Ausbildung im Ausland einer betrieblichen Ausbildung in Deutschland gleichgestellt ist\". So maybe the training has ff:recognizedByLaw linked to some official confirmation, but the ontology might not have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the ff:recognizedByLaw being one of the laws, but that's unclear. Maybe this part is ambiguous and we can't model it, so skip it as per the rules (only model clear requirements).\n\nAnother point for abroad training: for preparatory measures, the abroad part must not exceed half the duration (ff:percentAbroad ≤50%).\n\nNow, putting this into SHACL:\n\nWe need to create shapes with constraints.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the benefit (targeting ff:User), with a set of AND conditions.\n\nLet's structure the SHACL step by step.\n\nThe target class is ff:User, so the shape's target is ff:User.\n\nFirst, the person conditions:\n\n1. Wohnen nicht bei Eltern und der Betrieb ist zu weit weg, oder Alter ≥18, verheiratet, oder hat Kind:\n\nThis is an OR between:\n\n- (has parental address AND address tooFarFromTrainingCompany is true) OR\n\n- age ≥18 OR marital status is Married OR has at least one child (ff:hasChild exists)\n\nSo in SHACL, we can model this with a property path for the OR conditions.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or.\n\nLet me think: the first condition is either:\n\nA) (parentalAdress exists AND address has tooFarFromTrainingCompany true) OR\n\nB) age ≥18 OR marital status is Married OR hasChild exists.\n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nWe can structure this as a sh:or between the two possibilities.\n\nFirst, for part A:\n\nA) The user has at least one parental address (ff:parentalAdress some ?addr), and ?addr has ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany true.\n\nIn SHACL, that would be:\n\nsh:path ff:parentalAdress ;\n\nsh:someValuesFrom [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n]\n\nBut in SHACL, for an OR between A and B, you can have sh:or with two shapes.\n\nAlternatively, the user must either satisfy (parentalAdress with tooFar) OR (age ≥18 OR married OR has child).\n\nSo the shape for this condition would be:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n[ sh:and ( \n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:parentalAdress ; sh:minCount 1 ] ;\n\nsh:property [ sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ] ; sh:hasValue true ] \n\n) ]\n\n[ sh:or ( \n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ]\n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Married ] ]\n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasChild ; sh:minCount 1 ] ]\n\n) ]\n\n)\n\nWait, but how to model the inverse path for the address's tooFar? Maybe better to use a nested shape.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested shape for the first part:\n\nFor the first condition (parental address exists and that address has tooFar true):\n\nThe path would be ff:parentalAdress, and then in the node shape for that, the address must have ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany as true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [ \n\nsh:path ff:parentalAdress ;\n\nsh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n\nsh:qualifiedValues [ \n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\n]\n\n]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:someValuesFrom with a node shape.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe it's better to structure the SHACL with the or condition between the two main options (either the address condition OR the age/marital/child conditions).\n\nSo, the first part of the shape is an sh:or with two options.\n\nSecond condition on nationality and residence:\n\nThey are either German or not, but if not German, then they must not have AsylAct permit or (Tolerated status and <15 months).\n\nWait, the text says \"Auch wenn Sie nicht Deutscher sind, haben Sie grundsätzlich einen Anspruch auf Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe, es sei denn [excluded cases]\".\n\nSo the exclusion is only when they are non-German and in those cases.\n\nSo the condition is that the user is either:\n\n- German (ff:isNationalOf ff:Germany) OR\n\n- (not German AND NOT (hasAsylumActPermit OR (residenceStatus is Tolerated AND uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months is true)))\n\nSo in SHACL terms, that requires a NOT on the exclusion conditions.\n\nThis can be modeled with a sh:or between:\n\nGerman OR (non-German AND NOT (asyl permit OR (tolerated AND stay <15))).\n\nBut in SHACL, it's tricky to model NOT conditions. Maybe using sh:not.\n\nAlternatively, structure it as:\n\nsh:and ( \n\nsh:or ( \n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf ; sh:hasValue ff:Germany ] ]\n\n[ sh:and ( \n\n[ sh:not [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ]\n\n[ sh:not [ sh:and ( \n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:hasResidenceStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Tolerated ] ; \n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\n) ] ]\n\n) ]\n\n)\n\nHmm, this might be getting too nested, but necessary.\n\nThird condition: they cannot cover the costs. So ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds must be false.\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ; sh:hasValue false ]\n\nNow the training conditions:\n\nThe user must have an employment (ff:hasEmployment) which is a VocationalTraining (subclass of ff:VocationalTraining? Wait, the training is a VocationalTraining instance.\n\nWait, the user has ff:participates in the training, so the user's training (ff:participates) must be a VocationalTraining or similar?\n\nWait the user is a person, so they participate in a Training (ff:participates has range ff:Training). So the training instance must be of certain types.\n\nFirst, the training must be their first OR if not, they cannot be integrated otherwise.\n\nSo:\n\nThe training must be their first (ff:isFirstVocationalTraining true) OR (they have a disability that reduces work prospects permanently).\n\nWait, the text says: \"wenn es nicht Ihre erste Berufsausbildung ist: Sie können nicht auf eine andere Weise dauerhaft beruflich eingegliedert werden.\" So if not first, then they must not be able to be integrated otherwise, which implies that the disability causes this. So:\n\nThe user has a Disability (ff:hasDisabilityType linked to a Disability instance) which has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n\nAlternatively, the user has a Disability (ff:hasDisability is true) and that disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nEither (ff:participates's training has ff:isFirstVocationalTraining true) OR (user has a Disability with reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true).\n\nThis can be modeled with:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValues [ a sh:NodeShape ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ] ]\n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ] ; \n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ; sh:someValuesFrom [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ; sh:hasValue true ] ] ]\n\n]\n\nWait, perhaps better to use a path:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\nBut this requires that the user has a DisabilityType where that property is true. Alternatively, the user must have a hasDisabilityType which has that property.\n\nSo the shape for the second condition (not first) would require that the user has such a disability.\n\nNext, the training must be recognized by one of the laws:\n\nThe training (ff:participates) must have ff:recognizedByLaw linked to ff:VocationalTrainingAct, CraftsCode, MaritimeLabourAct, or NursingProfessionsAct (part 2? The NursingProfessionsAct's part 2 is mentioned, but the ontology lists NursingProfessionsAct as an individual. So assuming that's acceptable).\n\nSo the training must have ff:recognizedByLaw one of these four.\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValues [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ; sh:in ( ff:VocationalTrainingAct ff:CraftsCode ff:MaritimeLabourAct ff:NursingProfessionsAct ) ] ] ]\n\nAdditionally, they must have a contract (subjectToContract with VocationalTrainingContract):\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ( ff:participates / ff:subjectToContract ) ; sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingContract ]\n\nWait, the user's training must have subjectToContract linked to VocationalTrainingContract. So:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ( ff:participates / ff:subjectToContract ) ; sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingContract ]\n\nNow for disabled persons' conditions:\n\nIf the user has a disability, then:\n\nEither:\n\n- The training has a ruleExemptionBecause linked to a Disability (i.e., it's an exception), OR\n\n- They must live with parents (even if under 18).\n\nThe text also mentions needing to repeat or extend due to disability, but maybe that's covered by the previous conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have either:\n\nThe training has a ruleExemptionBecause linked to a Disability, or they live with parents (ff:parentalAdress exists? Or their residence is with parents? Wait, the condition says \"Sie im Haushalt der Eltern oder eines Elternteils wohnen.\" So the user's residence is at their parent's household. To model this, perhaps they have a parental address (ff:parentalAdress), but that's already part of the first condition. But in the disabled case, even if under 18, they can live with parents. The first condition's first option required that they are not living with parents (since they need to not live there or have another condition). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe the disabled condition allows them to live with parents regardless of age, so the first condition's requirements are overridden. Since this is part of the disability section, perhaps it's an OR with the main conditions.\n\nAlternatively, for disabled users, even if they are under 18 and live with parents, they can still qualify because of the disability clause. So the main first condition (about living with parents and distance) can be bypassed if the disability clause is met. But modeling this requires that the user either satisfies the main conditions OR the disability conditions.\n\nThis complicates things because it's an OR between multiple conditions. Maybe the disability conditions are part of the same overall OR as the main conditions. Alternatively, the disability conditions provide alternative paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the disability conditions are separate and must be met in addition, but the text says \"können Sie Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe auch bekommen\" which implies it's an alternative path.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Perhaps the best approach is to model the main conditions as a set of AND constraints, then include OR paths where necessary.\n\nFor the abroad part:\n\nFor abroad training:\n\n- If partial abroad (monthsAbroad ≤12 and percentAbroad ≤50%?)\n\nWait the text says \"teilweiser Auslandsaufenthalt darf nicht länger als 1 Jahr dauern (<=12 Monate) und im Hinblick auf die Gesamtdauer angemessen. For \"angemessen\" maybe the percentage is <=50% (since \"die Hälfte der vorgesehenen Förderdauer nicht übersteigen\" for preparatory measures). So for partial abroad vocational training:\n\nff:monthsAbroad <=12 and ff:percentAbroad <=50%.\n\nWait, the 'teilweise' condition applies to both vocational training and preparatory measures:\n\n- For vocational training abroad (teilweise):\n\n   - monthsAbroad <=12\n\n   - percentAbroad <=50% ?\n\nWait the exact text:\n\n\"bei teilweiser Ausbildung im Ausland, wenn der Teil der Ausbildung im Ausland nicht länger als 1 Jahr dauert und der Teil der Ausbildung im Ausland im Hinblick auf die Gesamtdauer der Ausbildung als angemessen erscheint\"\n\nSo monthsAbroad <=12 (since 1 Jahr = 12 Monate). The \"angemessen\" part might be captured by the percentAbroad <=50% (assuming that the part is not more than half the total duration). So:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:monthsAbroad ; sh:maxInclusive 12 ]\n\nAND sh:property [ sh:path ff:percentAbroad ; sh:maxInclusive 50 ]\n\nFor full abroad (vollständig im Ausland):\n\n- beneficial for career goal (maybe a comment, not modeled)\n\n- amtlich bestätigt (maybe via ff:recognizedByLaw? Not sure, so maybe skip as ambiguous.\n\nFor preparatory measures abroad:\n\n- part not exceeding half the duration (percentAbroad <=50%?)\n\nThus, for the abroad training conditions, the user's training must have these properties if it's abroad.\n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? Since the conditions depend on whether the training is abroad, perhaps using sh:or with a condition that if the training has monthsAbroad >0, then it must meet the criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the training can be in Germany or abroad with the criteria met.\n\nThis requires a more complex shape.\n\nPutting all together, the SHACL will have multiple conditions connected via AND and OR, with nested shapes.\n\nNow, considering the SHACL Core components (no extensions), I'll proceed to structure the Turtle code.\n\nThe main shape is for ff:User, with all the required conditions.\n\nStart with the main shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:ValidationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Person\n    ] ;

The text allows disabled to have certain cases like living with parents even if under 18, or other exceptions.\n            # Maybe it's part of the existing conditions, so perhaps this OR is not needed but included in the main structure.\n            # For now, perhaps this path is redundant and the main criteria already include it via the hasDisability part.\n        ) ]\n    ] .\n\nWait, this is getting very complex and might not capture everything correctly. Perhaps it's better to separate the conditions into multiple properties with sh:and and sh:or appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, the abroad conditions should be applied only if the training is abroad (monthsAbroad >0). So the condition for abroad is:\n\nIf (ff:monthsAbroad >0) then (monthsAbroad <=12 and percentAbroad <=50).\n\nBut in SHACL, we can't directly model \"if X then Y\" conditions, so we can require that either monthsAbroad is 0 (not abroad), or the conditions are met when it's abroad.\n\nHence the sh:or between monthsAbroad 0 or the two constraints.\n\nAlso, for preparatory measures (berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahmen), the user must have been commissioned by the agency. So if the training is a preparatory measure (instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea?), but the ontology has ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea as a subclass of Training. So:\n\nIf the training is a ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, then it must have ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nThus adding:\n\n# For preparatory measures (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea), must be commissioned\n[ sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValues [\n        a sh:NodeShape ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:not [ sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ) ] ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n        )\n    ]\n] ]\n\nThis ensures that if the training is an EntryProcedure..., then it must have commissioned.\n\nPutting all together, the SHACL will have many nested conditions. Due to the complexity and time constraints, I'll proceed to write the final code based on this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:ValidationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Person\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_574724 ;\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe.\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [\n                sh:and (\n                    # Wohnort condition\n                    [\n                        sh:or (\n                            [\n                                sh:and (\n                                    sh:property [\n                                        sh:path ff:parentalAdress ;\n                                        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:qualifiedValues [\n                                            a sh:NodeShape ;\n                                            sh:property [\n                                                sh:path ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ;\n                                                sh:hasValue true\n                                            ]\n                                        ]\n                                    ]\n                                )\n                            ] [\n                                sh:or (\n                                    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ;

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the eligibility requirements of the 'Kindergeld' (child benefit) with the IDLB B100019_LB_576986. The user provided an ontology and the German text describing the conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements and mapping them to the ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the user is the parent, so all conditions must be linked to the \"ff:User\" node. The SHACL shapes should enforce these conditions.\n\nLooking at the parent requirements:\n\n1. **Tax Liability**: The parent must be subject to unlimited income tax in Germany or treated as such. This applies to EU/EWR/Swiss nationals too. The ontology has ff:incomeTaxLiability which links to TaxLiabilityScope. The individual for unlimited is ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability. So, the parent's incomeTaxLiability must be ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\n   But there's an exception for non-EU/EWR/Swiss parents: they need a residence permit allowing work or be a recognized refugee/asylee. So need to handle those cases too. But first, for the main case, a shape for the user's incomeTaxLiability must be set.\n\n2. **EU/EWR/Swiss Nationals moving after August 2019**: If they are from EU/EWR/Switzerland and moved after August 2019, they must meet Freizügigkeitsgesetz (Freedom of Movement Act) conditions after 4 months. The conditions include being employed, job-seeking, deriving rights from a family member, sufficient means and health insurance, or permanent residence.\n\n   The ontology has ff:permanentRightOfResidence (boolean) for permanent residence. For employment status, ff:hasEmploymentStatus links to EmploymentStatus. Possible values include ff:Employee (employed), ff:JobSeeker (arbeitsuchend), ff:Unemployed (unfreiwillig arbeitslos). \n\n   Also, they might derive rights from a family member via ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom. Sufficient means is ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence (boolean) and health insurance is ff:adequateHealthInsurance (boolean).\n\n   The timing part (after 4 months) is tricky. The ontology has ff:MoveToGermany as an event with ff:hasDate. The condition requires that if the move was after August 2019 and the event's date plus 4 months has passed, then those conditions must be met. But SHACL can't compute dates, so maybe this part can't be modeled? The user instruction says not to model ambiguous requirements. Since we can't check the 4-month period in SHACL, perhaps we need to omit that part unless there's a property indicating it's past the 4-month mark. Looking at the ontology, there's ff:lessThanFourMonthsAgo (for events), but that's for events happening less than 4 months ago. Maybe the user data includes a flag for this? The problem is without that, we can't model it. Since it's unclear, maybe we can't include this condition and note it's ambiguous.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the person has to have been in Germany for more than 4 months, so if they moved, their move's date plus 4 months has passed. But without a property indicating that, maybe we can't model this. So perhaps exclude this part as ambiguous.\n\n3. **Non-EU/EWR/Swiss parents**: They must have a residence permit allowing work (ff:entitlesToEmployment on the permit) or be a recognized refugee/asylee (ff:recognizedRefugee or ff:entitledToAsylum).\n\n   The residence permit is linked via ff:hasResidencePermit. The permit must be of a type where ff:entitlesToEmployment is true. Or they must have ff:recognizedRefugee = true or ff:entitledToAsylum = true.\n\nNow, the child's conditions:\n\n1. **Child's residence**: The child must reside in Germany, EU/EWR, or Switzerland. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence (which is a Country). The allowed countries are Germany (ff:Germany), or any in EU/EWR/Switzerland (ff:EEAplusCH). So the child's countryOfResidence must be a subclass of EEAplusCH or Germany.\n\n   Alternatively, the ontology might not have a direct way to represent EEAplusCH as a class, but since it's a subclass of Country, maybe we can check if the country is in that class. In SHACL, we can use sh:class to require that the country is a subclass of EEAplusCH or Germany. Wait, but EEAplusCH is a class, so the country must be an instance of EEAplusCH or Germany. So:\n\n   For the child's countryOfResidence, the value must be an instance of (ff:EEAplusCH || ff:Germany).\n\n   Alternatively, since the child can be in another EU/EWR/Swiss country, the country must be a subclass of EEAplusCH. So, the range should be EEAplusCH or Germany. So the shape would have:\n\n   sh:path ff:countryOfResidence\n   sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n     sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:EEAplusCH ff:Germany ) ] ;\n   ] .\n\n2. **Alternative condition for child's residence**: Even if the child is in the EU/EWR/Switzerland, the parent must have unlimited tax liability in Germany. This seems like an alternative path. So either the child's residence is in allowed countries, OR the parent has unlimited tax liability. Wait, the description says \"Even if the child lives in another EU country, you might still be eligible if the parent is in Germany with unlimited tax liability.\" So the main condition is the child's residence, but there's an exception where if the parent has unlimited tax liability, it's okay even if the child is elsewhere in EU/Switzerland.\n\n   This complicates things. The SHACL needs to express an OR condition between two scenarios. But SHACL's core components don't support OR in shapes directly. Maybe we can structure it as two separate shapes with sh:or?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main requirement is that either:\n\n- The child is in Germany/EEAplusCH, OR\n\n- The parent has unlimited tax liability (and the child is in EU/Switzerland?)\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"Even if your child is in the EU/EWR/Switzerland household, you may qualify if you or the other parent has unlimited tax liability in Germany.\"\n\nSo if the child is in EU/Switzerland, then the parent must have the tax condition. So the child's residence can be in EU/Switzerland as long as the parent's tax is okay. But how to model this in SHACL?\n\nThis might require a more complex shape with OR between two conditions. But perhaps for simplicity, since SHACL's core components don't handle OR easily, maybe split into two shapes, but not sure. Alternatively, the main condition is that the child is in Germany/EEAplusCH, and the parent's tax condition is separate.\n\nAlternatively, the child's residence must be in Germany or another EU/EWR/Switzerland country. The second part is an alternative where even if the child is in another EU country, the parent's tax liability in Germany covers it. So the overall condition is that either the child is in Germany/EEAplusCH, or (child in EU/Switzerland AND parent has unlimited tax liability).\n\nBut modeling this in SHACL is challenging because it requires a conjunction in an OR. Maybe we can model the child's country as required to be in EEAplusCH or Germany, and the parent's tax condition is separate, but that might not capture the exception. Since the user instructions say not to model ambiguous parts, perhaps we can only model the primary conditions, not the exceptions unless clear.\n\nLooking back, the main points are:\n\nParent conditions:\n\n- Either:\n\n   a) They are EU/EWR/Swiss and meet tax/residence conditions, OR\n\n   b) Non-EU and have valid residence permit allowing work or are refugee/asylee.\n\nChild conditions:\n\n- Child resides in Germany or EU/EWR/Switzerland.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the SocialBenefit is B100019_LB_576986 (ff:B100019_LB_576986). The SHACL shape must target ff:User.\n\nStart with the main shape for the user:\n\nA shape with a targetClass ff:User, or targetNode ff:User?\n\nThe user is an individual (ff:User is an instance of Person). So the target should be the node ff:User.\n\nThus:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nThe main shape:\n\n:ChildBenefitShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be eligible for Kindergeld.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    ... other properties ...\n\nWait, but SHACL's validation is to check if the data satisfies the constraints. So the shape should enforce that the user meets all the required conditions. So instead of checking that they are eligible (since that's what we're validating), the shape should enforce that the necessary properties are present.\n\nAlternatively, the shape's properties will ensure that the user has the required properties, thus making them eligible. So the shape should have multiple sh:property constraints.\n\nNow, breaking down the parent conditions:\n\n1. Tax Liability:\n\nEither:\n\na) They are a EU/EWR/Swiss national (ff:isNationalOf linked to EEAplusCH or Germany) and have unlimited tax liability, OR\n\nb) They are not EU/EWR/Swiss but have a residence permit that allows employment or are refugee/asylee.\n\nWait, the first part says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatsangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz.\"\n\nSo the tax condition is that the parent has unlimited tax liability (ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability). Additionally, for non-EU/EWR/Swiss, they need other conditions.\n\nWait, the first bullet is for all parents (including EU), stating that they must be subject to unlimited tax in Germany or treated as such. The second bullet adds specific conditions for EU movers after 2019, but perhaps those are additional conditions on top?\n\nAlternatively, the first bullet is the main condition, and the second bullet adds extra requirements for EU citizens moving after 2019.\n\nBut since modeling the timing part (after 4 months) is ambiguous, perhaps we can focus on the tax condition and the other requirements.\n\nSo the first requirement is that the user (parent) has ff:incomeTaxLiability as ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nSecond, for non-EU/EWR/Swiss citizens, they need either a residence permit allowing work (ff:hasResidencePermit linked to a permit where ff:entitlesToEmployment is true) OR be a recognized refugee or asylee (ff:recognizedRefugee or ff:entitledToAsylum = true).\n\nSo the parent must either be:\n\n- A citizen of EU/EWR/Switzerland (so ff:isNationalOf is one of those countries) AND meet the tax condition, OR\n\n- Non-EU/EWR/Switzerland and meet the residence permit/refugee conditions.\n\nWait, the first bullet says that EU/EWR/Swiss are included in the tax condition. The second bullet adds that for EU/EWR/Swiss moving after 2019, after 4 months they need to meet the freedom of movement conditions. But perhaps the main tax condition is sufficient for the first part.\n\nAlternatively, the first bullet's tax condition applies to all, but for EU/EWR/Swiss moving after 2019, they must also meet the freedom conditions after 4 months. But since we can't model the time, perhaps ignore that part as ambiguous.\n\nThus, the main parent conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\n1. The user has ff:incomeTaxLiability as ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability, OR\n\n2. The user is not from EU/EWR/Switzerland and has a residence permit that allows work or is a refugee/asylee.\n\nWait, but the first part says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatsangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz.\"\n\nSo the tax condition is required for all parents, including EU citizens. The second bullet adds additional conditions for EU movers after 2019 (but we can't model that). The third bullet is for non-EU/EWR/Swiss: they need a permit allowing work or refugee/asylee status.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe parent requirements are:\n\n- First bullet: tax condition applies to all, including EU.\n\n- Second bullet: for EU/EWR/Swiss moving after Aug 2019, after 4 months they need to meet freedom of movement conditions. But since we can't model the 4-month period, perhaps this is an extra condition that can't be enforced here.\n\n- Third bullet: if not EU/EWR/Swiss, then must have a residence permit allowing work or be refugee/asylee.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL must enforce:\n\nThe user must have ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nAND (if they are not from EU/EWR/Switzerland, then they must have a residence permit that entitles to employment OR be a refugee/asylee).\n\nWait, but the tax condition is required regardless of citizenship. So the tax condition is mandatory for all.\n\nAdditionally, for non-EU citizens, they have to satisfy the residence permit/refugee condition.\n\nSo the shape would need:\n\n- A property for incomeTaxLiability must be ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\n- AND (for users not in EU/EWR/Switzerland, check their residence permit/refugee status).\n\nBut how to model the \"if not EU/EWR/Swiss\" condition? SHACL can do that via sh:qualifiedMinCount.\n\nAlternatively, the user's nationality is checked. If their nationality is not EU/EWR/Switzerland, then they must have the permit or refugee status.\n\nThe nationality is via ff:isNationalOf. So the country must be in EEAplusCH or Germany for EU/EWR/Swiss.\n\nWait, Germany is part of EEAplusCH? No, the EEAplusCH includes EU countries, EEA (like Norway), and Switzerland. Germany is an EU country, so part of EEAplusCH.\n\nWait the ontology says EEAplusCH is a subclass of Country. So ff:Germany is an instance of Country but not necessarily of EEAplusCH? Or perhaps Germany is an instance of EEAplusCH? The ontology's class hierarchy says EEAplusCH is a subclass of Country, so instances of EEAplusCH are countries in that group, but Germany is an individual of Country. Wait, looking at the ontology:\n\nThe ontology defines Individual: Germany as a Country. But the EEAplusCH class is a subclass of Country. So Germany would be an instance of EEAplusCH? The ontology does not explicitly state that. Since Germany is part of the EU, it's in EEAplusCH. So perhaps in the ontology, Germany is an instance of EEAplusCH. But the ontology's Individuals section only shows ff:Germany as a Country, not EEAplusCH. So maybe in the ontology, ff:Germany is a member of EEAplusCH. Since the ontology doesn't have that, perhaps we can't assume that. This is a problem. The ontology may not have the exact hierarchy, so we have to work with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, the user's nationality must be a country that is an instance of EEAplusCH or Germany. But since Germany is a Country instance, perhaps the EEAplusCH includes all EU/EWR/Switzerland countries. Therefore, the nationality country must be a subclass of EEAplusCH or Germany. But Germany is a Country, not a class. This is confusing. Maybe the user's nationality country must be an instance of EEAplusCH (e.g., Germany is part of EEAplusCH's instances). Since the ontology doesn't specify, this is an ambiguity. But the user instruction says to not model ambiguous parts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's nationality is a Country that is in the EEAplusCH class. So the ff:isNationalOf must point to a Country that is an instance of EEAplusCH or Germany. Since Germany is part of the EU, it's included in EEAplusCH. So the nationality country must be an EEAplusCH instance.\n\nThus, the condition for being EU/EWR/Swiss is that their nationality country is an instance of EEAplusCH.\n\nTherefore, the parent's nationality is either in EEAplusCH or not.\n\nSo the SHACL for the residence permit condition (for non-EU):\n\nWe can have a property that says if the user's nationality country is not an instance of EEAplusCH, then they must have a residence permit that allows employment or be a refugee/asylee.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with a sh:or condition that is only required if the nationality is not in EEAplusCH.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount:\n\nFor the non-EU/EWR/Switzerland case, the user must have either a residence permit with entitlesToEmployment true or recognizedRefugee or entitledToAsylum true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMaxCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ; # if it is an EEAplusCH country, then the next condition is not needed\n    ];\n    sh:or [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n            sh:not [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ; # nationality is not in EEAplusCH\n            sh:and [\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                    sh:exists true ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                        sh:hasValue true ;\n                    ]\n                ] ;\n                sh:or [\n                    sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n                    sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; sh:hasValue true ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, this might be too complex. Alternatively, separate the conditions with sh:or:\n\nThe overall shape must have:\n\nEither:\n\n1. The user's nationality is in EEAplusCH (so they are EU/EWR/Swiss), and they have the tax condition.\n\nOR\n\n2. The user is not in EEAplusCH and meets the permit/refugee condition.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe better to split into two shapes with sh:or, but since SHACL doesn't support that, perhaps use sh:and and sh:not.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure the parent's conditions as follows:\n\n- Must have ff:incomeTaxLiability as ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nAND\n\n- (Either the user is from EEAplusCH or Germany (so their nationality country is in EEAplusCH), OR they have a valid residence permit or refugee status).\n\nWait, no. The third bullet says for non-EU/EWR/Swiss, they need the permit or refugee status. So the permit/refugee condition is only required if they are not EU.\n\nThus:\n\nThe parent must have:\n\n1. ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nAND\n\n2. Either:\n\n   a) Their nationality country is an instance of EEAplusCH (or Germany, but since Germany is in EEAplusCH?), so ff:isNationalOf points to a country of class EEAplusCH,\n\n   OR\n\n   b) They have a residence permit that allows employment OR are a refugee/asylee.\n\nThus, the SHACL can express this with:\n\nFor the second condition, a sh:or between:\n\n- The nationality is in EEAplusCH,\n\nOR\n\n- They have the permit/refugee conditions.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n            sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ; # or including Germany?\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                sh:hasValue [ ff:entitlesToEmployment true ] ; # this is not correct syntax; need to use a nested shape\n            ] ]\n            [ sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            ) ]\n        ) ]\n    )\n]\n\nWait, actually, the permit must exist and its entitlesToEmployment is true. So:\n\nFor the residence permit part:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nAnd the refugee/asylee part is either recognizedRefugee or entitledToAsylum being true.\n\nThus, combining all:\n\nThe user must have:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability\n\nAND (either:\n\n- nationality in EEAplusCH, or\n\n- (has residence permit with entitlesToEmployment=true AND (recognizedRefugee or entitledToAsylum))\n\nWait, no, the permit OR the refugee status. So the permit and refugee/asylee are ORed.\n\nWait the non-EU/EWR/Swiss must have either a residence permit allowing employment OR be a refugee/asylee. So it's an OR between the permit and refugee/asylee.\n\nTherefore, the second condition is:\n\nEither:\n\nNationality in EEAplusCH,\n\nOR\n\n( (has a permit with entitlesToEmployment=true) OR (recognizedRefugee=true) OR (entitledToAsylum=true) )\n\nThus, in SHACL:\n\nThe shape for the second part is:\n\nsh:or (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf ; sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n    [ sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ]\n            ]\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    ) ]\n)\n\nPutting it all together, the parent's conditions are:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n],\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf ; sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n        [ sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                        sh:hasValue true ;\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n        ) ]\n    )\n]\n\nNext, the child's conditions.\n\nThe child must reside in Germany or another EU/EWR/Switzerland country. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence on the child.\n\nAssuming that the user has a child linked via ff:hasChild, and each child must satisfy the residence condition.\n\nThe user must have at least one child (since the benefit is for having a child), but the SHACL needs to check for each child's residence.\n\nBut how to express that all children linked via ff:hasChild have their countryOfResidence in EEAplusCH or Germany?\n\nWait, the user must have at least one child (but the existence of a child is not part of the eligibility conditions given here; the problem states \"Voraussetzungen, die für Ihr Kind gelten\", so the child must exist and meet the condition).\n\nThus, the user must have a child (ff:hasChild), and for each such child, their countryOfResidence must be in EEAplusCH or Germany.\n\nIn SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ; # must have at least one child\n    sh:each [\n        a sh:NodeShape ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                sh:or (\n                    [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ]\n                    [ sh:equals ff:Germany ]\n                )\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but the countryOfResidence is an object property to a Country instance. So the value must be an instance of EEAplusCH or Germany.\n\nWait, ff:Germany is an individual of Country, not a class. So to check if the country is Germany, we need to compare with the individual.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ]\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ]\n    )\n]\n\nBut sh:hasValue requires the exact individual. So the country must be either an instance of EEAplusCH or exactly Germany.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ]\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ]\n    )\n]\n\nTherefore, the child's countryOfResidence must be an instance of EEAplusCH or exactly Germany.\n\nPutting this into the shape:\n\nThe user must have at least one child, and each child's countryOfResidence must meet that condition.\n\nSo the shape for the user includes:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:each [\n        a sh:NodeShape ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                sh:or (\n                    [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ;\n                    [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ] ;\n                )\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nAdditionally, the second part of the child's condition: even if the child is in another EU country, the parent's tax condition covers it. But since the main condition already requires the child's country to be in EU/Switzerland or Germany, this is covered. The exception mentioned is if the child is in another EU country, but the parent's tax is okay. Since the parent's tax is already required to be unlimited, that's already covered. So maybe that exception is redundant and doesn't need modeling.\n\nNow putting all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape for the user (ff:User) will have:\n\n1. Must be eligible for Kindergeld (maybe not needed, since the shape is for eligibility).\n\n2. Income tax liability must be UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\n3. Either nationality in EEAplusCH or have the permit/refugee conditions.\n\n4. Must have at least one child with countryOfResidence in EEAplusCH/Germany.\n\nAdditionally, for the parent's EU/EWR/Swiss moving after 2019 part, but we can't model the timing, so omit.\n\nNow, the SHACL:\n\nThe full shape would be:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:ChildBenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n                sh:class ff:EEAplusCH\n            ] ]\n            [ sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                            sh:hasValue true ;\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ] ]\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            ) ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    \n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:each [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:or (\n                        [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ;\n                        [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ] ;\n                    )\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the second sh:property (the or between nationality and permit/refugee) needs to be a property with sh:or. Wait, the structure of SHACL's sh:or is that each condition in the list must be a node that is a valid constraint component.\n\nAlternatively, the second condition is an OR between two branches, so the shape has a sh:property that uses sh:or.\n\nBut the current structure is a sh:property that has sh:or, each of which is a sh:property or sh:and.\n\nWait, the correct way is:\n\nThe second property (the OR between nationality in EEA and permit/refugee):\n\nThe entire condition is a property that must be met, expressed as an OR between two possibilities.\n\nWait, actually, the user must satisfy either the nationality condition OR the permit/refugee condition. So this is a sh:or between two shapes.\n\nThus, the shape for the user has a property with sh:or, where each option is a shape.\n\nWait, perhaps better to structure it as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf ; sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n        [ sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ; ... ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; ... ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; ... ] ]\n        ) ]\n    )\n]\n\nBut this is getting complex. Alternatively, break it into two separate properties with sh:and and sh:not.\n\nAlternatively, since SHACL allows nested ORs, the above should work.\n\nBut I might have to adjust the syntax.\n\nWait, SHACL allows a sh:or to have a list of shapes. Each shape in the list is a condition that must be satisfied if the path is used.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nThe second condition (the OR between nationality in EEA and the permit/refugee part) is a property with sh:or, where each element of the or is a node that enforces one side.\n\nWait, perhaps the second condition is a sh:or between two options:\n\nOption 1: nationality is in EEAplusCH.\n\nOption 2: the permit or refugee/asylee.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n                sh:class ff:EEAplusCH\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        [\n            sh:or (\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                                sh:hasValue true\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ] ;\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ;\n                        sh:hasValue true\n                    ]\n                ] ;\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ;\n                        sh:hasValue true\n                    ]\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n]\n\nBut this requires that the entire second option (the permit or refugee) is satisfied.

Also, the 'hasChild' must have at least one child, and each child's country is correct.\n\nChecking the ontology for the 'countryOfResidence' on the child: The ontology says ff:countryOfResidence has domain Person, so the child (as a Person) has that property.\n\nAlso, the residence permit's entitlesToEmployment is a data property with range xsd:boolean, so using sh:hasValue true is correct.\n\nNow, finalizing the Turtle code, ensuring proper syntax.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:ChildBenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Income tax liability must be unlimited\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Nationality in EU/EWR/Switzerland or valid residence permit/refugee status\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            # Option 1: Nationality in EU/EWR/Switzerland\n            [\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n                    sh:class ff:EEAplusCH\n                ]\n            ] ;\n\n            # Option 2: Valid residence permit OR refugee/asylee status\n            [\n                sh:or (\n                    # Residence permit allows employment\n                    [\n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n                            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                                sh:property [\n                                    sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                                    sh:hasValue true\n                                ]\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ] ;\n\n                    # Recognized refugee\n                    [\n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                    ] ;\n\n                    # Entitled to asylum\n                    [\n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                )\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n\n    # Child must reside in Germany or another EU/EWR/Switzerland country\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:each [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:or (\n                        [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ] ;\n                        [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Ausbildungsgeld' benefit based on the given conditions. Let me start by breaking down the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the target node is ff:User, so the SHACL shape must focus on that. The benefit ID is B100019_LB_574711, which I should reference in the SHACL.\n\nThe first condition is that the user has a disability and their rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency. Looking at the ontology, the hasDisabilityType property links to Disability, but the data property hasDisability is a boolean. Wait, the condition says \"haben eine Behinderung\" so maybe the data property ff:hasDisability should be true. Also, the rehabilitation provider must be ff:FederalEmploymentAgency. The property hasRehabilitationProvider connects the person to the provider, so we need a SHACL constraint that checks that the user has a hasRehabilitationProvider equal to that individual.\n\nNext, the participation in one of the specified measures. The measures listed are first vocational training, vocational preparation, etc. Looking at the ontology, the Training subclass has instances like EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and School (maybe for education). The property participates links a person to a Training instance. So, the user must participate in at least one of these specific Training subclasses. The conditions mention \"erste berufliche Ausbildung\" which might be indicated by the isFirstVocationalTraining data property set to true. The \"Eingangsverfahren und Berufsbildungsbereich\" is the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea class. The other options like berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme might be another subclass, but in the ontology, School is a Training subclass. Hmm, maybe the user's participates property must link to a Training instance that is of any of the required types. So, in SHACL, I need to ensure that the participates property's object is a member of one of the allowed classes. Also, \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung\" might be under VocationalTraining or another subclass. Since the ontology isn't explicit, maybe I can just use the Training class and check the firstVocationalTraining flag?\n\nWait, the user must participate in one of the listed measures. Let me check each:\n\n- erste berufliche Ausbildung: the Training must have isFirstVocationalTraining = true.\n\n- berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme inkl. Grundausbildung: maybe this is a Training instance without being the first, but the ontology might not have specific classes here. Alternatively, maybe any Training except the first?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to check that the participates in a Training that is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or VocationalTraining, etc. Since the exact classes aren't all listed in the ontology, perhaps the best way is to require that the participates points to a Training instance that has either:\n\n- isFirstVocationalTraining = true, or\n\n- is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the user's participates must point to a Training that is one of those types. So in SHACL, the shape for the participates property would have a sh:hasValue or sh:targetClass? Wait, SHACL can use sh:targetClass with a list of allowed classes. Alternatively, for the first condition (first vocational training), the Training must have the data property isFirstVocationalTraining set to true. So perhaps the participates should link to a Training that has either:\n\nEither the Training is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, OR the Training has isFirstVocationalTraining = true.\n\nHmm, this might require a SHACL constraint that combines these possibilities. Alternatively, maybe the listed measures are all under the Training class but with different subclasses or properties. Since the user must be participating in one of these, the SHACL shape for participates should require that the object is a Training and has at least one of the required properties or is of the required subclass.\n\nWait, the first measure is \"(erste) berufliche Ausbildung\" which would be a VocationalTraining instance where isFirstVocationalTraining is true. The second is \"berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme\" which might be another type of Training, perhaps School or another subclass. The third is \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" — not sure which class that is. The fourth is \"Eingangsverfahren oder Berufsbildungsbereich\" which is EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nSo to cover all, maybe the participates must point to a Training that is either of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or has isFirstVocationalTraining = true, or is another specific type. Since the ontology may not have all these classes, perhaps the best approach is to require that the participates property's object is a Training instance, and it has either the firstVocationalTraining flag set to true or is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nWait, but the user must be participating in one of the listed measures. So the participates must have at least one of those specific Training types. So the SHACL constraint would need to check that the participates property's object is a member of any of the required classes or has the right properties.\n\nAlternatively, since the exact classes might not all be present, perhaps the user just needs to participate in a Training instance, and the other conditions are covered by other properties. Maybe I can structure this as:\n\n- The user must have at least one participates link to a Training instance that meets at least one of the following:\n\n  - The Training is an EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\n  - The Training has isFirstVocationalTraining = true.\n\nBut how to represent that in SHACL? Using sh:or with sh:targetClass and sh:property constraints.\n\nThird condition: \"Sie haben keinen Anspruch auf Übergangsgeld.\" The Übergangsgeld is the benefit with ID B100019_LB_102716305 (the one labeled as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\"). So the user must not have an isEligibleFor link to that benefit. So the SHACL should have a constraint that the user does not have an isEligibleFor pointing to that individual. Alternatively, maybe they must not have received it or be ineligible for it. The condition says \"keinen Anspruch\" so maybe they are not eligible for it. So the shape would require that the user does NOT have a isEligibleFor link to that benefit. Using sh:disjoint with sh:property and sh:hasValue.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User with sh:targetNode.\n\nFirst condition:\n\n- hasDisability must be true.\n\n- hasRehabilitationProvider must be exactly FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nSecond condition:\n\n- participates must have at least one object that is a Training instance and satisfies either:\n\n   - is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or\n\n   - has the isFirstVocationalTraining property set to true.\n\nWait, but the first option is a subclass, so maybe the Training is of that type, and the second is a property check. So combining these in SHACL with sh:or.\n\nThird condition:\n\n- does not have an isEligibleFor link to B100019_LB_102716305.\n\nNow, structuring each of these as SHACL constraints.\n\nFor the first part (disability and provider):\n\nShape for ff:User:\n\n- ff:hasDisability must be true: use sh:property with sh:hasValue true.\n\n- ff:hasRehabilitationProvider must be exactly FederalEmploymentAgency: sh:property with sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nSecond condition:\n\nThe participates must link to a Training that satisfies either:\n\nEither:\n\n   (a) The Training is EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or\n\n   (b) The Training has isFirstVocationalTraining = true.\n\nSo the shape for the participates property would have a sh:qualifiedValueShape:\n\nsh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n\nsh:qualifiedValueShape [ a sh:NodeShape;\n\n   sh:or (\n\n      [ sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n   )\n\n].\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or in the value shape.\n\nThird condition:\n\nThe user must not have an isEligibleFor link to B100019_LB_102716305. So:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor; sh:disjoint true; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]\n\nWait, sh:disjoint would mean that the value is not present. Or perhaps using sh:property with sh:disjoint and sh:hasValue?\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with sh:maxCount 0 for that specific value.\n\nWait, the correct way is to say that the user must not have any isEligibleFor links to that benefit. So:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor; sh:maxCount 0; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]\n\nBut I think that's not correct because sh:maxCount 0 would require no statements, but the hasValue would limit it. Alternatively, use sh:disjoint:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor; sh:disjoint ( ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ) ]\n\nWait, SHACL has a sh:disjoint which can be used to specify that a property's value must not be in a certain list. So the constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:isEligibleFor;\n   sh:disjoint ( ff:B100019_LB_102716305 )\n]\n\nThis means that the isEligibleFor property must not have any values equal to that specific benefit.\n\nPutting all these together in Turtle:\n\nThe shape for ff:User would include these constraints.\n\nNow, I need to make sure all prefixes are correctly used. The ontology uses ff: as the prefix for the terms.\n\nNow, writing the SHACL in Turtle:\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      )\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:disjoint ( ff:B100019_LB_102716305 )\n  ]\n.\n\nWait, but the 'participates' needs to have at least one object that meets either of the two conditions. The qualifiedMinCount ensures that at least one of the qualifiedValueShapes is satisfied.\n\nAlso, the first condition on hasDisability must have the data property set to true. The hasRehabilitationProvider must have the exact individual.\n\nAdditionally, the 'participates' must have at least one link. The qualifiedValueShape checks that the target meets at least one of the or conditions.\n\nThis should cover all three conditions. Let me check again:\n\n1. Disability: hasDisability true and provider is FederalEmploymentAgency ✔️\n\n2. participates in a Training that is either EntryProcedure... or first vocational ✔️\n\n3. not eligible for Übergangsgeld ✔️\n\nI think that's correct. Now, making sure the Turtle syntax is right. Also, the shape is named appropriately, maybe using the benefit ID as the shape name.\n\nThe benefit's ID is B100019_LB_574711, so perhaps the shape is named as ff:B100019_LB_574711Shape or similar.\n\nWait, the problem says the SHACL should be used to determine eligibility for the benefit, so the shape is for the User node to check eligibility for this benefit. So the shape's name isn't critical as long as it's valid.\n\nNow, I'll write the final Turtle code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  # Bedingung 1: Behinderung und Rehabilitationsträger ist Bundesagentur\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Bedingung 2: Teilnahme an zulässiger Maßnahme\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:or (\n        # Eingangsverfahren/Berufsbildungsbereich\n        [ sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n        # Erste berufliche Ausbildung\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      )\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Bedingung 3: Kein Anspruch auf Übergangsgeld\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:disjoint ( ff:B100019_LB_102716305 )\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the unemployment benefit 'Arbeitslosengeld' (Unemployment Benefit) with the ID B100019_LB_576842 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be unemployed. That means either not in an employment relationship or working less than 15 hours a week. Also, they must be available for placement by the employment agency. \n\nThe conditions mention checking the employment status. The ontology has ff:EmploymentStatus with individuals like ff:Unemployed and ff:RegisterdUnemployed. The property ff:hasEmploymentStatus would link the user to their status. So, the user must have an employment status that is either Unemployed or RegisteredUnemployed?\n\nWait, the exact condition says they are unemployed if they are not in employment or work less than 15 hours. The ontology's ff:Unemployed individual has a comment saying \"not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" So the user's hasEmploymentStatus should be exactly ff:Unemployed. \n\nNext, they must be available for placement. The ontology has the data property ff:availableForPlacement (boolean). So that needs to be true.\n\nThen, registration: they must have registered electronically or in person. The ontology might not have a direct property for registration method, but the key is that they are registered. The registration is part of the employment status. Since the user is already under ff:User, perhaps the employment status being ff:RegisteredUnemployed covers that? Wait, the RegisteredUnemployed individual's comment says \"officially registered as unemployed.\" So the employment status should be ff:RegisteredUnemployed. Hmm, but the original condition says they have to register either electronically or in person. But maybe the presence of the employment status as RegisteredUnemployed is sufficient here. The registration method might not be modeled, but the fact that they are registered is captured by the employment status. So the user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus exactly ff:RegisteredUnemployed.\n\nWait, but the first condition says \"Sie arbeitslos sind, das heißt, ... und Sie stehen den Vermittlungsbemühungen zur Verfügung.\" So being unemployed and available. The RegisteredUnemployed status might already imply being available? The ontology's description of ff:RegisteredUnemployed says \"not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" But availability is another condition, so maybe the ff:availableForPlacement data property must be true.\n\nSo the employment status must be either Unemployed or RegisteredUnemployed? Or perhaps the correct one here is RegisteredUnemployed because they have to register. Let me check the ontology again. The ff:Unemployed individual's comment says \"not in employment ... and available for placement.\" Wait, the description says: \"not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" The availability is part of the condition, so perhaps the employment status being Unemployed includes the availability? Or maybe the ff:availableForPlacement is a separate check.\n\nLooking at the problem statement's first condition: \"Sie stehen den Vermittlungsbemühungen der Agentur für Arbeit zur Verfügung. Sie sind also in der Lage und bereit, eine versicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung unter arbeitsmarktüblichen Bedingungen aufzunehmen;\" So that's exactly what the ff:availableForPlacement data property's description says: \"True if a person is able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions, false otherwise.\" So the user must have ff:availableForPlacement = true.\n\nSo combining, the employment status must be such that they are considered unemployed (either not employed or <15h), and also available. But the employment status ff:Unemployed might already include being available? The ontology's ff:Unemployed's comment is \"not in employment ... and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" Wait, that seems redundant, maybe a translation error. The key is that the employment status should be either Unemployed or RegisteredUnemployed? Or perhaps the correct is that the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, since they have to register. Hmm, the problem states they must have registered, so the employment status is RegisteredUnemployed. Because the ff:RegisteredUnemployed individual's comment says \"officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\"\n\nTherefore, the user must have:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus exactly ff:RegisteredUnemployed (to ensure they are registered)\n- ff:availableForPlacement = true (to ensure availability, even though maybe that's implied, but the problem explicitly mentions it)\n\nNext condition: within the last 30 months before registration (Rahmenfrist), they must have been subject to compulsory insurance for at least 12 months. The ontology has the data property ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30, which is a boolean indicating exactly this. So that must be true.\n\nAdditionally, the 12 months can include times when they were receiving benefit replacement payments (like Krankengeld), or due to care of a relative/child, or voluntary extended insurance (freiwillige Weiterversicherung), or certain cases like Development Service or secondment abroad. \n\nHowever, the SHACL must not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. The ontology has ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 which already encapsulates all these considerations. Since the data property exists, we can just check that it's true. So no need to model the individual components, as the ontology's property already aggregates them. Therefore, the user must have ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 = true.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape for the User node should have constraints on:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus must be exactly RegisteredUnemployed\n- ff:availableForPlacement must be true\n- ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true\n\nAlso, the target is ff:User, so the shape should target that node.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL.\n\nThe shapes graph will have a shape that targets the User node. The shape will have three constraints:\n\n1. For hasEmploymentStatus:\n   - sh:property with path ff:hasEmploymentStatus\n   - sh:hasValue exactly ff:RegisteredUnemployed\n\n2. For availableForPlacement:\n   - sh:property with path ff:availableForPlacement\n   - sh:hasValue true\n\n3. For compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30:\n   - sh:property with path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30\n   - sh:hasValue true\n\nAdditionally, the shape must be declared with sh:targetNode ff:User.\n\nLet me check if all the ontology terms are correctly used. The RegisteredUnemployed is an individual of EmploymentStatus. The data properties are correctly in the ontology. The SHACL properties use Core components only.\n\nWait, the first condition also requires that they are not in employment or work less than 15h. The ff:hasEmploymentStatus being RegisteredUnemployed might already cover that. But perhaps the employment status RegisteredUnemployed is a subset of those conditions. Since the ontology's description for ff:RegisteredUnemployed says \"officially registered as unemployed with the authorities\" and the comment for ff:Unemployed mentions the 15h condition, but maybe the employment status RegisteredUnemployed implies the 15h condition. Alternatively, perhaps there's another check needed. \n\nWait, the employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, which according to the ontology's comment includes the conditions of being unemployed (not employed or <15h) and registered. So the ff:hasEmploymentStatus being RegisteredUnemployed should cover both the employment status and the registration. The availability is a separate check via the data property. So the three constraints are sufficient.\n\nAnother point: the user must have applied by filling out the form. The problem states \"Zusätzlich muss noch ein Antragsformular ausgefüllt werden\". But this is an action the user must do, not a state in the RDF data. Since we can't model that (as it's an external action not represented in the data), we can ignore it. SHACL can't enforce actions outside the data, only the data's state.\n\nThus, the three constraints are correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UnemploymentBenefitShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:RegisterdUnemployed ;\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] .\n``` \n\nWait, there's a typo in the employment status.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' (ID B100019_LB_102799525). The user provided the conditions in German, so first I should translate those to understand them correctly.\n\nThe first condition is: \"Sie müssen einen Anspruch auf Hinterbliebenenleistung aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung haben.\" This translates to \"You must have a claim to survivors' benefit from the statutory accident insurance.\" \n\nLooking at the ontology, the SocialBenefit in question is likely an individual, but the user mentioned the IDLB as B100019_LB_102799525. However, in the ontology provided, there isn't an individual with that exact ID. The closest is B100019_LB_102716305 labeled as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\". Maybe there's a typo, but since the user specified the ID, perhaps I should use that as the target. Wait, but the user says to target \"ff:User\". The shapes should apply to the user node.\n\nThe second condition is: \"Sie haben wiedergeheiratet oder eine neue Lebenspartnerschaft nach dem Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz begründet.\" Translates to \"You have remarried or entered into a new civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act.\"\n\nNow, translating these into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst condition: The user must have a claim to survivors' benefit from statutory accident insurance. Survivors' benefit here would be part of the statutory accident insurance (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance). The ontology has ff:hasInsurance, but maybe the user must be linked to an insurance that is StatutoryAccidentInsurance. However, the exact property might be related to eligibility. Wait, the user needs to have a claim (anspruch), which might be represented by ff:isEligibleFor. But the benefit here is the one we're validating, so perhaps the user must have a previous eligibility for a survivors' benefit. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a relationship via ff:receivedBenefit or similar.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the ontology, the Survivors' benefit might be a SocialBenefit, but it's not listed in the provided individuals. Maybe the user must be eligible for another benefit first. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a legal status that grants this. Since the exact mapping isn't clear, perhaps the first condition is that the user has an insurance (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance), and they have a claim. But maybe the better approach is that the user has an employment status linked to accident insurance. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Alternatively, the 'hasInsurance' property must link to StatutoryAccidentInsurance, so:\n\nA SHACL constraint that the user must have an insurance that is a type of StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So:\n\nShape for ff:User must have a ff:hasInsurance that is exactly StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nBut the first condition is about having a claim to survivors' benefit, which might require that they are a beneficiary due to someone's death. Maybe the user must be a spouse or relative of someone who had an accident. Wait, the exact ontology terms might help here. Looking at the ontology, there's ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner. Maybe the user must be linked via one of those properties to a person who had an accident leading to death. But the condition is more about having the claim, so perhaps the user must have received the survivors' benefit before, or is eligible. Since the exact property isn't clear, but the user must have a claim, maybe the better approach is that the user has an insurance (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance) and has a marital status that allows it. Alternatively, maybe the user must be in a marital status that allows the benefit after remarriage. Wait, the second condition is about having remarried or new civil partnership, but the first condition requires the existence of a claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first condition is that the user has a legal entitlement, which might be represented via a property like ff:isEligibleFor, but for the survivors' benefit. Since that specific benefit isn't listed, perhaps it's better to model it as the user must have a certain marital status (like widowed) and then remarried, but the second condition covers the remarriage part.\n\nWait, the second condition is that they have remarried or entered a new civil partnership. So for the second condition, the user's marital status must be either Married or in a CivilUnion (since CivilUnion is an individual of MaritalStatus). However, the condition says \"after the death\", but the user's current marital status must be either married or in a civil union again. \n\nSo the second condition can be modeled by checking that the user's marital status is Married or CivilUnion.\n\nBut how to represent the 'after the death'? That might require a temporal aspect, which is harder. Since the ontology has ff:MaritalStatus, and the user's current status must be one of those, perhaps that's the main point. The \"nach dem Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz\" (under the Civil Partnership Act) might be covered by the existence of the CivilUnion instance.\n\nNow putting this together:\n\nFirst condition: The user must have a claim to survivors' benefit. Assuming that this is linked via having the StatutoryAccidentInsurance, but maybe the better way is that the user has an event related to the death of a spouse, leading to the survivors' benefit. Alternatively, the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner. Looking at the ontology, there are ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner properties. So the user must have at least one of these.\n\nSo the first condition would require that the user has either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. So in SHACL, that would be a OR constraint on those two properties.\n\nSecond condition: The user has remarried (ff:Married) or has a new civil partnership (ff:CivilUnion) as their marital status. So their marital status must be either Married or CivilUnion.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape for the User would have two constraints:\n\n1. MUST have either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner.\n\n2. MUST have ff:hasMaritalStatus exactly one of Married or CivilUnion.\n\nAdditionally, the target is the ff:User node.\n\nNow, considering SHACL components, for the first condition, we can use sh:or with two paths, each requiring existence.\n\nThe shape would look something like:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first condition's OR is between having a deceased spouse OR a deceased civil partner. So the first property's sh:or would have two options where either the path ff:deceasedSpouse has at least one, or the path ff:deceasedCivilPartner has at least one. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:or with two different paths:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nWait, but sh:alternativePath is for when the path can be any of the alternatives, but here we need at least one of the two properties to exist. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:or with each condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:hasValue true ] \n        [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n    )\n]\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use sh:or with two conditions, each being the existence of one of the properties. \n\nAlternatively, the first condition can be expressed as:\n\nEither the user has a deceased spouse (ff:deceasedSpouse with at least one value), OR a deceased civil partner (ff:deceasedCivilPartner with at least one value). So in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nWait, but sh:or on the path might not be correct. Alternatively, the sh:or in the constraint components.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to have a sh:or where each component is a constraint that checks for the presence of either property. \n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n    )\n]\n\nYes, that's better. Each of the two paths must have at least one value, and the OR condition requires that at least one of them is true.\n\nFor the second condition, the marital status must be either Married or CivilUnion, so:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:maxCount 1\n]\n\nThis ensures exactly one of those two values.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle syntax:\n\n```\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;  # This line might not be necessary, but ensures the target is correct\n        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1\n    ] .\n```\n\nWait, but the first property block (the OR) needs to specify that it's a property constraint. The structure is:\n\nsh:property [ ... ] for each constraint.\n\nAlso, the first OR condition's path is covered by the sh:or within the sh:property.\n\nI think that's correct. The first property's sh:or requires that at least one of the two paths has at least one value. The second property ensures that the marital status is one of the two options.\n\nThis should satisfy both conditions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Either has deceased spouse or civil partner\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Marital status must be Married or CivilUnion\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Married ff:CivilUnion ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1\n    ] .\n```"

The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure started.\n\nLooking at the ontology provided, the SocialBenefit individual for Social Assistance is ff:SocialAssistance. The first condition requires the user to be receiving this. So, the user must have an ff:receivesBenefit link to ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: The need was determined with the Integration Specialist. Hmm, the ontology has ff:IntegrationAssistance as a SocialBenefit, but maybe the Integration Specialist is part of a process. However, looking at the ontology properties, there's no direct property indicating approval by an Integration Specialist. The third condition mentions approval by the Jobcenter (Jobcenter is probably the Federal Employment Agency, which is ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). The second condition might be about having a conversation, but perhaps this is not directly modelable unless there's a property. Since the user must have participated in a program approved by the Jobcenter, maybe the third condition can be modeled with a Training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency. Wait, the third condition says \"Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt\" which translates to participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure started. \n\nLooking at the ontology, there's a property ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on ff:Training. So if the user is participating in a Training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency, that could satisfy the third condition. Also, the user must be participating in such a training (ff:participates).\n\nThe second condition is a bit tricky. The ontology doesn't have a direct property indicating a conversation with an Integration Specialist. Since the user must have had this conversation, maybe this is part of an event or some property. Alternatively, maybe this is inferred through another property, but the problem states to avoid ambiguous requirements. Since there's no clear property for this, I might have to exclude it as it's not directly modelable with the given ontology. \n\nSo focusing on the first and third conditions:\n\nFirst condition: The user must be receiving SocialAssistance (ff:receivesBenefit ff:SocialAssistance).\n\nThird condition: The user is participating in a Training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true).\n\nAdditionally, the participation must be approved before the measure starts. The ontology has ff:intendedFundingPeriod on Training, but that's about duration. Maybe the training needs to have a trigger or start date, but the problem might just require the commissioning.\n\nSo, the SHACL shapes should:\n\n- Target ff:User.\n\nFor the first condition:\n\nA SHACL constraint that requires the user to have an ff:receivesBenefit link to ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nFor the third condition:\n\nThe user must have a participation (ff:participates) in a Training (ff:Training) which has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency equal to true.\n\nAdditionally, the Training's commissioning must be before the measure starts, but how to model the timing? Since the ontology has ff:hasDate on Event, but the measure start isn't directly modeled here. Maybe the approval is just the commissioning, so the existence of the commissioning is sufficient.\n\nSo the SHACL graph would have:\n\nA shape for the user that:\n\n- MUST have a receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance.\n\n- MUST have a participates in a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nNow, constructing the SHACL:\n\nThe SHACL graph will have shapes for ff:User, with properties:\n\n1. For the first condition:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance\n]\n\n2. For the third condition:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:class ff:Training;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n      sh:minCount 1;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the node shape for the Training would need to be defined, or we can use sh:node to specify constraints on the Training object. Alternatively, using sh:sparql for more complex constraints, but since we need to use only SHACL Core components, perhaps the second condition can be expressed as:\n\nThe user must participate in a Training that has the commissionedByEmploymentAgency property as true.\n\nSo using sh:property on participates with a node constraint.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle syntax:\n\nThe shapes graph should have a shape for the User node, with these two constraints.\n\nAlso, the shape should have sh:targetNode ff:User.\n\nSo the code would look something like this:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:Training ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:Node ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n\nWait, but SHACL's sh:node is a NodeConstraint that requires the target nodes (the Training instances) to conform to a shape. However, here we can inline the constraints. Alternatively, using a path to the property.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount for the participates property where the Training has the commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true. But maybe the way above is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nThe participates must have at least one object which is a Training with commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nAnother approach is:\n\nThe participates must have a path to a Training node that has the property.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with a path that navigates through participates and then to the commissioned property.\n\nWait, the path for the second condition is:\n\nff:participates followed by ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency.\n\nBut the user has ff:participates pointing to a Training. So the path would be:\n\nff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency.\n\nBut in SHACL, to ensure that at least one of the participates objects has this property set to true, we can use sh:hasValue with sh:qualifiedMinCount.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach using sh:qualifiedMinCount:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n] .\n\nThis would require that at least one of the participates objects (Training) has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nThat's probably better because it ensures that among the participations, at least one is a Training with that property.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\nThe second SHACL property becomes:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;  # The user must participate in at least one Training\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;  # At least one of those participations must meet the qualified shape\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:class ff:Training ;  # Ensure it's a Training instance\n  ] ;\n] .\n\nBut maybe the class can be omitted if the ontology already defines the domain/range, but to be explicit, including it might help.\n\nSo the full SHACL would have:\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 1: receives SocialAssistance\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 3: participates in a Training commissioned by Jobcenter\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ; # Must have at least one participation\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; # At least one must meet the qualified shape\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:class ff:Training ; # Must be a Training instance\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n\nThe second condition (\"festgestellt im Gespräch mit Integration Specialist\") isn't covered here because there's no ontology property for that. Since the user is instructed not to model ambiguous requirements, we can omit it.\n\nThus, the final SHACL graph should include these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n  # Condition 1: Must receive Social Assistance (Grundsicherung)\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 3: Participation must be approved by Jobcenter before measure start\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ; # User must participate in at least one training\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; # At least one participation must meet the criteria\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:class ff:Training ; # Ensure it's a formal training program\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ; # Must be commissioned by Employment Agency (Jobcenter)\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph problem. First, I need to understand the requirements for the social benefit \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102717659. The user provided the conditions in German, so I'll start by translating those into English to make sure I grasp them correctly.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1. The person has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of developing such a disability.\n2. Their responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency.\n3. Their prospects of participating in working life are significantly and not just temporarily reduced due to the nature and severity of their disability, necessitating assistance to participate in the workforce.\n4. They are willing to undergo vocational training or other forms of integration into the workforce.\n\nNext, I need to map these conditions to the ontology provided. Let me go step by step.\n\n**Condition 1: Severe Visual or Hearing Impairment or At Risk**\nThe ontology has classes for Disability, and subclasses VisualImpairment and HearingImpairment. The properties ff:hasDisabilityType and ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType can be used here. The requirement specifies \"hochgradige\" (severe), so I should check if there's a property indicating severity. Looking at the ontology, there's ff:severeDisability data property under Disability. So each Disability instance must have severeDisability true. Also, the person must either have a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment via hasDisabilityType or be at risk via atRiskOfDisabilityType. \n\nWait, the condition includes both having the disability or being at risk. So the user must have either a Disability of type Visual or Hearing with severeDisability true, or an atRiskOfDisabilityType that's Visual or Hearing. Hmm, but the atRiskOfDisabilityType's range is Disability, so maybe the type can be checked via its subclass. Alternatively, the user must have either:\n- ff:hasDisabilityType a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, and that disability has ff:severeDisability true; \nOR\n- ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, and the same severity? The problem states \"hochgradige\" applies to the existing or potential disability. Wait, the problem says \"hochgradige Seh oder Hörbehinderung oder Ihnen droht eine solche Behinderung.\" So the risk is of the same severe type. So the atRiskOfDisabilityType must also be a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment and be severe? Or is the severity only required for existing disabilities? The wording says \"hochgradige\" applies to both existing and potential. So the risk must also be of a severe type. So in SHACL, for the atRiskOfDisabilityType, the target value must be an instance of (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) with severeDisability true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SHACL can model that the Disability (whether via hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType) is an instance of either Visual or Hearing and has severeDisability true. But how to combine these? Let me think. \n\nThe first condition could be an OR between:\n- (hasDisabilityType some (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) and (hasDisabilityType's severeDisability is true))\nOR\n- (atRiskOfDisabilityType some (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) and (atRiskOfDisabilityType's severeDisability is true))\n\nBut in SHACL, we can use sh:or and sh:and. So for the shape, the user must have either one or the other. Let me structure that.\n\n**Condition 2: Rehabilitation Provider is Federal Employment Agency**\nThe property ff:hasRehabilitationProvider must link to ff:FederalEmploymentAgency. So the user must have exactly that individual as their rehabilitation provider. So in SHACL, the path is ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, and the value should be exactly the individual FederalEmploymentAgency. So sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n**Condition 3: Reduced Work Prospects Permanently and Need Help**\nThe third condition says that their work prospects are significantly and not just temporarily reduced due to disability's nature/severity, requiring assistance. The ontology has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as a data property on Disability. Wait, looking at the ontology, ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is a data property of Disability, so if the disability (the one causing the issue) has this set to true. However, the condition is about the disability causing the reduced prospects. Since the disability is already covered in condition 1, perhaps we need to ensure that the Disability (either via hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType) has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a Disability (from condition 1) that has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. Since the first condition ensures the disability is severe and of the right type, this is an additional requirement on that disability.\n\nWait, the condition states that the disability's nature and severity caused the reduction. The ff:severeDisability is already part of the first condition, so maybe the ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is the key here. The problem says \"nicht nur vorübergehend\" (not just temporary), so the reduction is permanent. Therefore, the Disability must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nThus, the shape should include a constraint that any Disability (from the first condition) has this property. But how to reference that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't traverse to the Disability instance's properties directly in a shape for the user, perhaps we need to model this as part of the first condition's constraints. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a Disability with both severeDisability and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently set to true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a Disability (via hasDisabilityType) which is an instance of Visual or Hearing, and has severeDisability = true and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. Or for the atRisk case, same.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the SHACL shape for the user must have:\n\nFor the first condition (disability or at risk):\n\nEither:\n\n- hasDisabilityType some (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) and (hasDisabilityType's severeDisability is true AND hasDisabilityType's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true)\n\nOR\n\n- atRiskOfDisabilityType some (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) and (atRiskOfDisabilityType's severeDisability is true AND reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true)\n\nWait, but the problem says the user has the disability or is at risk. The atRisk is about developing the disability, but the condition 3's requirement is that their prospects are already reduced because of the disability's nature/severity. So maybe the atRisk case might not yet have the disability, so perhaps the atRisk part isn't considered for the reducesWorkProspectsPermanently? The problem states \"wegen Art und Schwere Ihrer Behinderung\", so the disability (existing) must be the cause. Therefore, perhaps the atRisk case is only part of the first condition, but the third condition requires that the existing disability (if any) has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. Wait, but the atRisk part might not have the disability yet, so maybe the third condition applies only if they already have the disability. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The problem says \"Ihre Aussichten ... sind wegen Art und Schwere Ihrer Behinderung nicht nur vorübergehend...\". So \"Ihre Behinderung\" implies they have it. Therefore, the third condition applies only if they have the disability, not if they are at risk. So the atRisk case is covered in the first condition, but for the third condition, only those with existing disabilities need to have the reducesWorkProspectsPermanently set to true. \n\nTherefore, the first condition is split into two possibilities (existing or at risk), but the third condition only applies to the existing case. This complicates the SHACL because the third condition's constraints depend on whether the user has the disability or is at risk. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that either they have the disability (with the required properties) or are at risk (and the at-risk disability would presumably be severe and reduce prospects, but maybe the SHACL can't enforce that on a future condition). Since the SHACL must be based on current data, the atRisk case might not have the actual disability's properties, so perhaps the third condition only applies if they have the existing disability. Therefore, the third condition requires that if they have a disability (from the first condition's existing case), then it must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. But how to model that in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third condition is an additional requirement on the existing disability (if present) and the atRisk case isn't considered for that. Since the problem's third condition states that the user's prospects are reduced because of their disability's nature/severity, which exists, the third condition's constraints can be applied as a mandatory property on the Disability instances that are linked via hasDisabilityType. \n\nSo putting it all together, the first condition's existing disability must have:\n\n- is a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment\n- has severeDisability = true\n- has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true\n\nOR\n\nThe user is at risk of such a disability (via atRiskOfDisabilityType), which must also be Visual/Hearing and severe? Wait, the problem's first condition says \"hochgradige Behinderung oder Ihnen droht eine solche Behinderung\" (severe disability or you are at risk of such a disability). So the atRisk must be of a severe disability of the same type. Therefore, the atRiskOfDisabilityType must be an instance of Visual or Hearing, and have severeDisability true. But since it's a future risk, maybe the ontology's atRiskOfDisabilityType's range is Disability, so the target Disability must be of those types and have those properties. But how to enforce that in SHACL? \n\nHmm, perhaps the SHACL needs to ensure that any Disability linked via atRiskOfDisabilityType is a Visual or Hearing, and has severeDisability true. However, the third condition's requirements about reducesWorkProspectsPermanently would not apply to the atRisk case, since that's about existing disabilities. \n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should break down each condition into SHACL constraints step by step.\n\n**Condition 1 (existing disability or at risk):**\nThe user must have either:\n- a hasDisabilityType that is a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, and that Disability has severeDisability true, and also reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true (because of condition 3)\nOR\n- an atRiskOfDisabilityType that is a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment and that Disability has severeDisability true (since the risk is of such a severe disability, but maybe not needing reducesWorkProspects because it's future? The problem says \"droht eine solche Behinderung\" (risk of such a disability), so \"solche\" refers to the severe one, so the atRisk must be for a severe disability of that type. The third condition's requirement about the prospects being reduced applies only to existing disabilities, so the atRisk case doesn't need to meet condition 3's parts, but condition 1 requires the atRisk to be of a severe disability of the right type.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL for condition 1 must have:\n\nEither (hasDisabilityType some (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) and (hasDisabilityType's severeDisability is true)) \nOR \n(atRiskOfDisabilityType some (VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) and (atRiskOfDisabilityType's severeDisability is true)) \n\nAdditionally, the existing disability (via hasDisabilityType) must also have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true for condition 3.\n\nWait, but condition 3 is a separate condition, so perhaps it's better to split them. Let me separate the conditions.\n\n**Condition 3 is separate:**\nThe user's disability (existing, via hasDisabilityType) must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. However, if the user is only at risk, they might not have the disability yet, so this condition might not apply. But the problem states that the reduced prospects are due to their disability's nature/severity, implying they have it. Therefore, the third condition requires that if they have a disability (via hasDisabilityType), then that disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. So in SHACL terms, we can model this as:\n\nFor the user's hasDisabilityType, the Disability instances must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nBut how to combine this with the first condition's existing disability part?\n\nAlternatively, the first condition's existing disability part must include both the type, severity, and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true, while the atRisk part only needs the type and severity. So:\n\nCondition1's existing disability part:\nhasDisabilityType some [ a (ff:VisualImpairment or ff:HearingImpairment); \n                        ff:severeDisability = true;\n                        ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true ]\n\nCondition1's atRisk part:\natRiskOfDisabilityType some [ a (ff:VisualImpairment or ff:HearingImpairment); \n                             ff:severeDisability = true ]\n\nThen, the first condition is either of these two, and the third condition is covered in the existing disability part.\n\nHmm, that might work. So in SHACL, the first condition's OR is between these two cases, and the third condition is already included in the existing disability case.\n\n**Condition 4: Willingness to undergo training or integration**\nThe fourth condition says the user is willing to undergo vocational training or other integration. The ontology has ff:availableForPlacement as a data property, which is \"able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions\". But the problem's wording is slightly different: \"bereit, sich beruflich bilden oder auf andere Weise beruflich eingliedern zu lassen.\" So maybe availableForPlacement is appropriate here. Alternatively, there might be another property. Looking at the ontology's data properties, ff:availableForPlacement seems to fit. The value must be true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the property is ff:availableForPlacement. Let me check the ontology's description for ff:availableForPlacement: \"True if a person is able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions, false otherwise.\" The problem's condition is about willingness to undergo training or integration, which might align with being available for placement. So setting ff:availableForPlacement to true would satisfy this.\n\nNow, putting all the constraints together into a SHACL shape targeting ff:User:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- A sh:targetClass of ff:User.\n- sh:property for each condition, using sh:or where necessary.\n\nLet me outline each constraint step by step:\n\n1. Condition 1: Existing Disability or At Risk\n\nThis is an OR between two paths:\n\nEither:\n\n- hasDisabilityType with a Disability that is Visual or Hearing, severe, and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n\nOR\n\n- atRiskOfDisabilityType with a Disability that is Visual or Hearing and severe.\n\nIn SHACL:\n\nThe user must have either one or the other. So using sh:or, each part is a sh:property with the respective path and constraints.\n\nThe existing disability part:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n   sh:sparql [ \n      sh:prefix \"ff\";\n      sh:select \"\"\"\n         ASK WHERE {\n            ?this ff:hasDisabilityType ?dis.\n            ?dis a ff:VisualImpairment, ff:HearingImpairment .\n            ?dis ff:severeDisability true .\n            ?dis ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true .\n         }\n      \"\"\" .\n   ]\n]\n\nWait, but in SHACL Core, we can't use SPARQL, since the user said to use only SHACL Core components. So need to use sh:property with sh:node and sh:and.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use sh:qualifiedMinCount with sh:qualifiedValueShapes. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, for the existing disability case:\n\nThe path is ff:hasDisabilityType, and the value must be an instance of (VisualImpairment OR HearingImpairment), and have severeDisability=true and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently=true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n   sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n   sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n      sh:each [\n         sh:and [\n            sh:node [ sh:or [ sh:instanceValue ff:VisualImpairment; sh:instanceValue ff:HearingImpairment ] ];\n            sh:property [\n               sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n               sh:hasValue true\n            ];\n            sh:property [\n               sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently;\n               sh:hasValue true\n            ]\n         ]\n      ]\n   ]\n]\n\nSimilarly for the atRisk part:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType;\n   sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n   sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n      sh:each [\n         sh:and [\n            sh:node [ sh:or [ sh:instanceValue ff:VisualImpairment; sh:instanceValue ff:HearingImpairment ] ];\n            sh:property [\n               sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n               sh:hasValue true\n            ]\n         ]\n      ]\n   ]\n]\n\nThen, the OR between these two properties.\n\n2. Condition 2: hasRehabilitationProvider = FederalEmploymentAgency\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider;\n   sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n]\n\n3. Condition 4: availableForPlacement = true\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:availableForPlacement;\n   sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nPutting all together in a shape:\n\nThe shape for the User must have all these properties, with the first condition being an OR between the existing disability and atRisk cases.\n\nWait, but the existing disability and atRisk are part of the first condition's OR. So in SHACL, the first condition's OR is between the two paths.\n\nTherefore, the shape will have a sh:property with sh:or between the two paths (existing and atRisk), plus the other required properties (rehabilitation provider and availableForPlacement).\n\nBut how to structure this. The overall shape would look something like this:\n\n:EligibilityShape\n   a sh:NodeShape ;\n   sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n   sh:property [\n     sh:path ... ; # first condition\n     sh:or ( \n        [ sh: ... existing disability path constraints ]\n        [ sh: ... atRisk path constraints ]\n     )\n   ] ;\n   sh:property [ condition2 ] ;\n   sh:property [ condition4 ] .\n\nBut the first condition is an OR between the two options (existing or atRisk). Each option is a property path with its own constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the first condition's OR can be represented using sh:or with each branch being a property with its own constraints.\n\nSo the first sh:property block would be:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:or (\n      [ \n         sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n         sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n         sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n            sh:each [\n               sh:and [\n                  sh:node [ sh:or [ sh:instanceOf ff:VisualImpairment; sh:instanceOf ff:HearingImpairment ] ];\n                  sh:property [\n                     sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n                     sh:hasValue true\n                  ];\n                  sh:property [\n                     sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently;\n                     sh:hasValue true\n                  ]\n               ]\n            ]\n         ]\n      ]\n      [ \n         sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType;\n         sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n         sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n            sh:each [\n               sh:and [\n                  sh:node [ sh:or [ sh:instanceOf ff:VisualImpairment; sh:instanceOf ff:HearingImpairment ] ];\n                  sh:property [\n                     sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n                     sh:hasValue true\n                  ]\n               ]\n            ]\n         ]\n      ]\n   )\n]\n\nWait, but the sh:or applies to the entire property's path and constraints. Alternatively, perhaps each branch of the OR is a separate property constraint. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:or in the sh:property. \n\nAlternatively, the first condition is an OR between two different path constraints. So using sh:or on the sh:property's conditions.\n\nI think the way to model this in SHACL Core is to have a sh:property with sh:or where each alternative is a property constraint.\n\nTherefore, the first condition's two options (existing or atRisk) are each separate in the sh:or list.\n\nNow, proceeding to write the Turtle code.\n\nAlso, note that the SocialBenefit in question is B100019_LB_102717659, but since the user says to target ff:User, and the SHACL graph should be about validating the user data, the shapes should be linked to the user node.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe shape will be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:EligibilityShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ; # Not sure, but maybe not needed\n        sh:or (\n            [ \n                sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n                    sh:each [\n                        sh:and [\n                            sh:node [ \n                                sh:or ( \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:VisualImpairment ] \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:HearingImpairment ] \n                                )\n                            ] ;\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n                                sh:hasValue true \n                            ] ;\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                                sh:hasValue true \n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] \n            [ \n                sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n                    sh:each [\n                        sh:and [\n                            sh:node [ \n                                sh:or ( \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:VisualImpairment ] \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:HearingImpairment ] \n                                )\n                            ] ;\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n                                sh:hasValue true \n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n.\n\nWait, but the first sh:property's sh:or is over the two paths (hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType), each with their own constraints.\n\nWait, no. Each element in the sh:or is a separate property constraint. So each branch is a full property with path and constraints. So the first part is correct.\n\nNow checking for any missing constraints. \n\nAlso, the third condition's part about the disability reducing prospects is only for existing disabilities, which is covered in the first branch (the hasDisabilityType part) because in that branch, reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is required.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, check for the other conditions. \n\nThe second condition is covered by the hasRehabilitationProvider.\n\nFourth condition is availableForPlacement.\n\nIs there anything else? The third condition is split between the existing disability's requirements (already in the first branch) and nothing else. The problem's third condition is fully addressed by ensuring the existing disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true, which is part of the existing disability's constraints.\n\nI think this covers all conditions.\n\nNow, ensure that all terms used are from the ontology. For instance, ff:VisualImpairment and ff:HearingImpairment are valid classes. ff:FederalEmploymentAgency is an individual. The properties like severeDisability and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently are data properties of Disability, so that's okay.\n\nI think this should work. Now, let's format it into Turtle as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n\n:EligibilityShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ; # Dummy path to wrap the OR condition\n        sh:or (\n            # Condition 1a: Existing severe visual/hearing impairment with reduced work prospects\n            [ \n                sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n                    sh:each [\n                        sh:and [\n                            # Disability must be VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment\n                            sh:node [ \n                                sh:or ( \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:VisualImpairment ] \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:HearingImpairment ] \n                                )\n                            ] ;\n                            # Must be severe and permanently reduce work prospects\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n                                sh:hasValue true \n                            ] ;\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                                sh:hasValue true \n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] \n            # Condition 1b: Risk of such a disability (must be severe)\n            [ \n                sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n                    sh:each [\n                        sh:and [\n                            # At-risk disability must be VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment\n                            sh:node [ \n                                sh:or ( \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:VisualImpairment ] \n                                    [ sh:instanceOf ff:HearingImpairment ] \n                                )\n                            ] ;\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n                                sh:hasValue true \n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    # Condition 2: Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n    ] ;\n    # Condition 4: Must be available for placement\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' (ID B100019_LB_582422). Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nFirst, the conditions are:\n1. The user must have had a work-related accident, a commuting accident, or an occupational disease.\n2. The user is participating in a qualified measure for participation in working life (occupational rehabilitation).\n\nI need to translate these into SHACL constraints targeting the node ff:User. Let me look at the ontology to find the right properties and classes.\n\nFor the first condition: The user must have an event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. The ontology shows that these are subclasses of ff:Event. The property ff:hasEvent connects a person to an event. So the constraint would require that the user has at least one event of these types.\n\nIn SHACL, I can use sh:property with sh:minCount 1. The path would be ff:hasEvent, and the sh:class should be one of those three classes. Since SHACL allows union of classes, I can list all three as possible targets.\n\nSecond condition: The user is participating in a training (ff:Training) that is part of occupational rehabilitation. The ontology has ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, which is a class. But looking at the properties, there's ff:participates which links a person to a Training. Wait, the requirement says \"qualified measure\", which might be a subclass of Training. However, the exact class for occupational rehabilitation in the ontology is ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, but it's not a subclass of Training. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class with a German label \"Berufliche Rehabilitation\". The property ff:resultsInTreatment links an event to OccupationalRehabilitation, but the participation is via ff:participates which connects to Training. Hmm, maybe there's a subclass of Training that represents rehabilitation? Alternatively, perhaps the 'qualified measure' is an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation. Wait, the ontology shows that ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, but there's no direct Training subclass for it. Alternatively, maybe the participation is in a Training that is part of rehabilitation. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent which links EarningCapacity to Event, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the participation in a measure for occupational rehabilitation might be linked through another property. The problem is that the ontology might not have a direct link here. Let me re-examine the ontology's properties.\n\nLooking at ff:participates, it's defined as linking a person to a Training (e.g., formal training). The requirement says \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" which is occupational rehabilitation. Since ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, maybe the participation is in an instance of that class. But ff:participates has a range of ff:Training, and ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is not a subclass of Training. That could be an issue. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the ontology again:\n\nWait, looking at the classes, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a direct class, not a subclass of Training. Hmm. The problem is that the participation in a training for occupational rehab would need to be modeled via a Training instance that is part of the rehabilitation. Alternatively, maybe the 'measure' is an instance of Training that is connected via another property to OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'qualified measure' is an instance of Training and the requirement is that the person is participating in such a Training. The exact ontology might not have a direct link here, but given the problem statement, perhaps we can model it as the user must have a participates link to a Training, and that Training is part of the rehabilitation. But since the ontology doesn't have a property linking Training to OccupationalRehabilitation, maybe the key is that the training is a form of occupational rehabilitation, so the Training instance must be of a type that's part of rehabilitation. But without a specific subclass, perhaps the best approach is to look for any Training linked via participates, but I might have to make an assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a participation in a Training that is connected via some property to OccupationalRehabilitation. For example, maybe the Training has a trigger or some other link. Alternatively, perhaps the requirement is simply that the user is participating in any Training, but that doesn't fit. Since the exact ontology doesn't specify, maybe I have to proceed with the available data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second condition is that the user is participating in a Training, and that Training is part of an OccupationalRehabilitation. Since the ontology has the property ff:resultsInTreatment which links an Event to OccupationalRehabilitation, maybe the Training is the result of that treatment. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'qualified measure' is the OccupationalRehabilitation itself. But since the user participates in a Training, and the Training is part of the Rehabilitation. Since the ontology might not have a direct link, but the problem requires that the user is participating in such a measure, maybe the best approach is to require that the user has a participates link to a Training, and that the Training is somehow associated with OccupationalRehabilitation. However, since the ontology doesn't provide a direct property, perhaps the only way is to require that the user has a participates to a Training, and that's sufficient? But that might be too broad. Alternatively, maybe the Training is required to be of a specific type, like an instance of a subclass under Training. Looking at the ontology's Training subclasses, there's ff:VocationalTraining, ff:School, ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. Maybe one of those is relevant here. Alternatively, the problem's German label \"berufliche Reha\" (occupational rehab) might correspond to the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, but the participation is via a Training. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the participation in the rehabilitation is modeled via another property. Let me check the ontology again for properties related to rehabilitation. There's ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which links a person to their rehabilitation provider. But that doesn't directly indicate participation in a program. Another property is ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause, which points to a Disability causing need for integration, but that's not directly about participation in a program.\n\nWait, maybe the requirement is that the user is participating in a Training that is part of an occupational rehabilitation program. Since the ontology's Training class has subclasses like VocationalTraining, perhaps the user must be in a VocationalTraining. Alternatively, the key is that the user's participation is in a Training, and the Training is for rehabilitation. Since the ontology might not have explicit links, perhaps the best approach is to require that the user has a participates link to a Training (any instance of Training), and that's the best we can do given the ontology. The problem says \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" which is occupational rehabilitation, but if the ontology doesn't have a specific class for that, maybe the requirement is just that they are in any Training, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the Training must be commissioned by the employment agency, as there's a property ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training, which might be part of the qualification. But the text doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the problem's second condition: \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben teil (berufliche Reha)\". The German term \"berufliche Reha\" is exactly the label of the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. So maybe the participation is in an instance of that class. But the property ff:participates has a range of ff:Training, so unless ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a subclass of Training, this won't work. Checking the ontology: ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a direct class, not a subclass of Training. Therefore, the user can't participate in an OccupationalRehabilitation via participates, because that expects a Training.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe there's an error in the ontology or I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The ontology lists ff:OccupationalRehabilitation as a class with no parent class except owl:Thing? Wait, no, the ontology shows:\n\nClass: ff:OccupationalRehabilitation\n    Annotations: rdfs:label \"Berufliche Rehabilitation\"@de \n\nNo SubClassOf listed, so it's a top-level class. The participates property's range is ff:Training, so the user can't participate in an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the user must be participating in a Training that is part of an occupational rehabilitation program, but the ontology doesn't specify a direct link. Alternatively, maybe the occupational rehabilitation is a subclass of Training that I overlooked. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking at the ontology's classes under Training subclasses:\n\n- ff:VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training.\n- ff:School is a subclass of Training.\n- ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training.\n\nHmm. None of these are OccupationalRehabilitation. So perhaps the ontology is missing a subclass, but given the problem, I have to work with what's provided. Alternatively, maybe the 'qualified measure' is a Training that's linked to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance via some property. For example, the Training might have a property that indicates it's part of a rehabilitation. Looking at properties, there's ff:triggeringEvent which links EarningCapacity to Event, but that's not helpful. There's also ff:resultsInTreatment which links Event to OccupationalRehabilitation. Maybe the Training is the result of that treatment? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the participation in any Training is sufficient if the user is undergoing rehabilitation. But the problem states that the participation must be in a qualified measure for occupational rehab. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property here, perhaps the best we can do is to require that the user has a participates link to some Training. That might be the closest given the ontology's structure. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a participation in a Training that is part of a RehabilitationProvider's program. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is that the user has a participation in a Training, and that there is a related OccupationalRehabilitation instance. For example, the user's participation in a Training is part of their rehabilitation. But without a property linking Training to OccupationalRehabilitation, this is hard to model. Since the problem requires strict compliance without inventing terms, I might have to proceed with the available data, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'qualified measure' is an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, and the user is participating in it via a different property. Let me check all properties again. The ff:hasRehabilitationProvider links a person to the provider, but not the program itself. The ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause points to a Disability. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must be undergoing occupational rehabilitation, which is indicated by the property ff:hasEvent linking to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. But no, the Event is a different class. Wait, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, so an instance would be an object of that type. But how does the user link to it? There's no property in the ontology that directly connects a Person to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance except maybe via ff:triggeringEvent, but that's for EarningCapacity.\n\nThis is tricky. Since the problem requires using only the ontology's terms and not inventing new ones, perhaps the best approach is to model the second condition as the user must have a participates link to a Training. Even if it's not explicitly occupational rehab in the ontology, that might be the only way given the data. Alternatively, perhaps the 'qualified measure' is a VocationalTraining, which is a subclass of Training, so requiring that the Training is of type VocationalTraining.\n\nWait, the problem's second condition says \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" which translates to a qualified measure for participation in working life. VocationalTraining (Berufsausbildung) is a type of training that leads to a job, so that might be the intended. The ontology has ff:VocationalTraining as a subclass of Training. Therefore, maybe the user must be participating in a VocationalTraining. That could be a valid assumption. \n\nSo for the second condition, the user must have a participates link to a Training that is an instance of ff:VocationalTraining. That would satisfy the requirement for a qualified measure leading to work participation. Let me check the ontology again for ff:VocationalTraining's properties. \n\nYes, ff:VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training, so using sh:class to require that the Training instance is of that type would work. So the second SHACL constraint would be on ff:participates, requiring that the target is a VocationalTraining.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the measure is any Training, but the key is that it's part of rehabilitation. Since that's not in the ontology, perhaps the VocationalTraining is the best bet. Alternatively, the problem might accept any Training linked via participates, but I need to follow the ontology strictly.\n\nGiven the ambiguity here, but needing to comply with ontology terms, I'll proceed by requiring the participates link to a Training that is an instance of ff:VocationalTraining. Therefore, the SHACL constraints would be:\n\nFirst condition:\n- The user has at least one event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nSecond condition:\n- The user participates in a Training that is a VocationalTraining.\n\nNow, structuring this into SHACL.\n\nThe SHACL shapes will be under the targetClass ff:User. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nFor the first condition:\n\nA SHACL property constraint on ff:hasEvent:\n- sh:path ff:hasEvent\n- sh:minCount 1\n- sh:class [sh:or (ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, ff:OccupationalDisease)]\n\nWait, in SHACL, to require that the object of hasEvent is one of those three classes, we can use sh:class with a list of allowed classes. The sh:or construct is used for enumerating allowed values, but for classes, it's better to use sh:class with a list of possible classes. Alternatively, using sh:qualifiedValueShape where the target class is one of the three.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or with a list of sh:Class shapes:\n\nsh:class [\n    a sh:or;\n    sh:oneOf (\n        ff:WorkAccident\n        ff:CommutingAccident\n        ff:OccupationalDisease\n    )\n]\n\nWait, no. The correct way to do this is to have a sh:qualifiedValueShape with sh:class being one of the three classes. Alternatively, using sh:nodeKind, but that's for datatypes or literals. Hmm.\n\nWait, the correct approach is to use sh:class and specify the allowed classes via sh:or. Let me check SHACL syntax. The sh:class can take a list of allowed classes. Alternatively, using sh:qualifiedValueShape with sh:class on the value shape.\n\nHere's how it can be written:\n\nFirst condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        a sh:NodeShape;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, actually, in SHACL, to require that the value of hasEvent is an instance of one of those classes, you can use sh:class with the list of classes. The sh:class can accept multiple classes in a list, and the value must be an instance of at least one of them. So perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n]\n\nBut I need to confirm if SHACL allows multiple classes in sh:class. According to SHACL specs, sh:class is a list of classes, so this should work. So that's acceptable.\n\nSecond condition:\n\nThe user must participate in a Training that is an instance of VocationalTraining.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ff:VocationalTraining\n]\n\nAlternatively, since the Training must be of that type, yes.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape for ff:User will have these two property constraints.\n\nAdditionally, the shape should have sh:targetClass ff:User and be part of a SHACL graph.\n\nNow, writing this in Turtle syntax:\n\nThe SHACL shape for the social benefit B100019_LB_582422 would be named something like :Shape_B100019_LB_582422, but since the user just needs the graph, perhaps we can structure it with the shapes starting with a node that targets the User.\n\nWait, the user says \"must therefore always target the node 'ff:User'\". So the shape must have sh:targetClass ff:User.\n\nSo the complete Turtle would look like this:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the second condition is about participating in a \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\", which in the problem is translated as occupational rehabilitation. However, I assumed that VocationalTraining is the appropriate class. If the ontology had a better class, but given the data, this is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'qualified measure' is any Training, but the problem specifies 'berufliche Reha', so the OccupationalRehabilitation class must be involved. But since the participates links to Training and not OccupationalRehabilitation, perhaps the Training must be connected via another property to OccupationalRehabilitation. For example, the Training might have a property that indicates it's part of the rehab. But without such a property, I can't model that.\n\nGiven the constraints of using only the ontology terms and not inventing new ones, the best possible is to require participates to VocationalTraining, as it's a type of training related to work.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL as above should be correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Work/Commuting accident or occupational disease\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Participation in vocational training (qualified measure for work participation)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the Insolvenzgeld (B100019_LB_576848) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints should target this node. The SHACL graph must use only SHACL Core components and the provided ontology terms. I must ensure that each condition from the text is translated into SHACL shapes accurately without introducing new terms or assumptions.\n\nLooking at the first condition: there must be an insolvency event. The insolvency event can be one of three scenarios. In the ontology, there's an individual called ff:InsolvencyProceeding and ff:InsolvencyApplication. The third scenario mentions a discontinuation of business activity due to lack of assets. The ontology has ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness as a subclass of Event. So, the insolvency event (ff:Event) must be either an InsolvencyProceeding, InsolvencyApplication (rejected for lack of assets), or DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets set to true.\n\nNext, the user must have not been paid wages for up to three months before the insolvency event. The ontology has ff:wageCutOffsetMonths on Event. The wageCutOffsetMonths should be between -3 and 0, indicating the wage cut happened up to three months before the event. Also, the ff:causesLossOfEarnings should be true for the event.\n\nThird condition: the user must be an employee within Germany or temporarily abroad while maintaining German social security. The ff:countryOfEmployment should be Germany or another country but with socialSecurityCountry as Germany. Wait, the ontology has ff:countryOfEmployment for Employment, so if they're abroad but still under German social security, the countryOfEmployment could be another country but socialSecurityCountry is Germany. Alternatively, maybe the Employment's country is Germany or the user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany regardless of employment location. Need to check ontology properties. The user's socialSecurityCountry is a property of ff:Person, so the constraint would be that socialSecurityCountry is Germany. Additionally, the employment's country could be Germany or another, but social security remains Germany.\n\nFourth condition: the user must be legally recognized as an employee via a status determination. The user must have a ff:hasEmploymentStatus that is ff:Employee, and this needs to be confirmed by the Clearingstelle. Since this is a formal decision, maybe the user must have a ff:triggeringEvent that results in this status? Alternatively, perhaps the user must have an EmploymentStatus of Employee via some certification. The ontology has ff:Employee as an EmploymentStatus. So, the user's employmentStatus must be ff:Employee. The note mentions that if they're a managing partner, etc., they need a ruling. So, perhaps the user must have an employment status of Employee, and if they are in certain roles (like partner in a GmbH), they must have a specific determination. However, since the ontology might not have those roles explicitly, maybe it's sufficient that their employmentStatus is Employee, and the SHACL can enforce that. The exact method of proving it (via the status determination) might be an external check, so maybe just check the employmentStatus is Employee.\n\nPutting this into SHACL shapes:\n\n1. The main shape targets ff:User. The conditions are:\n\n   - Must have an insolvency event (one of the three scenarios). So, the user must have a ff:hasEvent that is either an InsolvencyProceeding, or an InsolvencyApplication with rejectedForLackOfAssets true, or a DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets true.\n\n   - The insolvency event must have wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0, and causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\n   - The user's employment must be in Germany or under German social security. So, check that socialSecurityCountry is Germany.\n\n   - Employment status must be Employee.\n\n   - Also, the user must be an employee (ff:EmploymentStatus is ff:Employee).\n\nWait, need to structure this properly. Let's break down each condition.\n\nFirst, the insolvency event (ff:Event):\n\nThe user must have an event that is an instance of either:\n\n- ff:InsolvencyProceeding (which is a subclass of Event)\n\n- ff:InsolvencyApplication (but only if it was rejected for lack of assets, so check ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets is true on the application)\n\n- ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness (and has obviousLackOfAssets true)\n\nSo the event must be of type one of these three, with appropriate properties.\n\nThe SHACL shape for the event would have a sh:or condition covering the three cases.\n\nSecond, the wage cut duration:\n\nThe wageCutOffsetMonths (on the event) must be between -3 and 0 (since up to 3 months before the event). So:\n\nsh:hasValue ?event .\n\n?event ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ?months .\n\nsh:MinInclusive 0 (no, wait: the wageCutOffsetMonths is the number of months before the event. The event's date is the reference. If wageCutOffsetMonths is -3, that means 3 months before the event. The condition says \"up to 3 months before\", so between -3 and 0 inclusive.\n\nWait the property's description says: \"Negative (resp. positive) values indicate a wage cut before (resp. after) the event.\"\n\nSo for the wage cut to have occurred up to 3 months before the event, the wageCutOffsetMonths must be between -3 and 0 (inclusive). So:\n\nsh:hasValue ?event .\n\n?event ff:wageCutOffsetMonths [ sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ; sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int ]\n\nAlso, the event must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nThird condition: user's employment location and social security.\n\nThe user must be employed either in Germany or temporarily abroad but still under German social security.\n\nFor the first part: countryOfEmployment is Germany (ff:Germany). But for the second part, the user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany, regardless of where the employment is located. So the employment's country might be another country, but the user's socialSecurityCountry must be Germany. So:\n\nThe user must have ff:socialSecurityCountry = Germany.\n\nFourth condition: employment status must be Employee.\n\nSo, user's ff:hasEmploymentStatus must be exactly ff:Employee.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe main shape for the User would have a sh:and with multiple constraints.\n\nBut since some conditions involve the event, need to chain the shapes.\n\nPerhaps, the User must have an event that meets the insolvency criteria, and the event must also have the wageCutOffsetMonths and causesLossOfEarnings.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have the socialSecurityCountry as Germany, and employmentStatus as Employee.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL:\n\nFirst, create a shape for the User (ff:User) that requires:\n\n- has an event of type InsolvencyEvent (which is a union of the three cases)\n\n- that event must have the wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0, and causesLossOfEarnings is true.\n\n- user has socialSecurityCountry = Germany\n\n- user has hasEmploymentStatus = Employee\n\nAdditionally, the employment status part: the user's employment status must be ff:Employee.\n\nBut the ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus with range ff:EmploymentStatus, and the instance ff:Employee is an EmploymentStatus. So:\n\nFor the employment status:\n\nUser must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus exactly equal to ff:Employee.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\n[ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Employee ]\n\nNow for the insolvency event:\n\nThe event must be either:\n\n- an instance of ff:InsolvencyProceeding\n\nOR\n\n- an instance of ff:InsolvencyApplication with ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets = true\n\nOR\n\n- an instance of ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness with ff:obviousLackOfAssets = true\n\nSo the shape for the event (which is connected via ff:hasEvent) must be:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n[ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ]\n\n[ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n[ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n)\n\nAlso, the event must have:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; sh:minInclusive -3 ; sh:maxInclusive 0 ]\n\nand\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\nTherefore, the User shape will have a path to ff:hasEvent, and the value must be a node that meets all these conditions.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape would look like this:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ] \n      [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n      sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n      sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n      sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Germany\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Employee\n  ] ;\n.\n\nWait, but the \"sh:or\" is on the event's class and properties. The way SHACL handles this is that each of the or conditions must be satisfied by the target of the path. So for the ff:hasEvent property, the value must be one of the three cases, plus the other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, the \"sh:or\" is a list of possible shapes that the event must satisfy. So the first part (sh:or) is for the class and some properties, then the other properties (wageCut and causesLoss) must also be present.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure should be:\n\nThe shape for the hasEvent property requires that the event node satisfies one of the three class conditions (insolvency proceeding, etc.), plus the wageCut and causesLoss properties. So the sh:or is on the class parts, and the other constraints are separate.\n\nAlternatively, each alternative in sh:or would include all the necessary properties. Let me think again.\n\nThe event must satisfy either:\n\nCase 1: it's an InsolvencyProceeding, and has the wageCut and causesLoss.\n\nCase 2: it's an InsolvencyApplication with rejectedForLackOfAssets true, and also has wageCut and causesLoss.\n\nCase 3: it's a DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets true, and also has wageCut and causesLoss.\n\nSo each of the or options includes the class condition and any additional properties. The wageCut and causesLoss are common to all cases.\n\nTherefore, each alternative in the sh:or list must include the class and the other constraints. So:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n  [ \n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; \n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; sh:minInclusive -3 ; sh:maxInclusive 0\n    ] ; \n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ] \n  ]\n\n  [ \n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; \n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ; \n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; sh:minInclusive -3 ; sh:maxInclusive 0\n    ] ; \n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ] \n  ]\n\n  [ \n    sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; \n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ; \n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; sh:minInclusive -3 ; sh:maxInclusive 0\n    ] ; \n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ] \n  ]\n\n)\n\nThis way, each alternative in the or clause requires the respective class plus the necessary properties. This ensures that whichever event type is chosen, the other constraints are also met.\n\nHowever, this might be redundant because the wageCut and causesLoss are common to all cases. To avoid repetition, perhaps structure the or part only for the class and specific properties, then have the common properties outside.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL allows for a more efficient way. Let me see:\n\nThe path ff:hasEvent must point to a node that:\n\n- is of one of the three classes (with their respective properties)\n\nAND\n\nhas wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0,\n\nAND\n\ncausesLossOfEarnings is true.\n\nTherefore, the shape can be written with the sh:or for the three event types (each with their class and any specific properties), and then additional sh:property constraints for the common properties (wageCut and causesLoss). However, SHACL doesn't allow mixing sh:or and other properties in the same sh:property list. So the way to do this is to include the common properties inside each of the sh:or options. That's a bit verbose but necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out the common properties. Let me try:\n\nFirst, the or condition for the three event types (each with their class and any specific properties like rejectedForLackOfAssets or obviousLackOfAssets). Then, for all three cases, the wageCut and causesLoss must also be present. Therefore, each or option must include those properties.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the SHACL for the hasEvent property is:\n\nsh:property [ \n\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n\n  sh:or ( \n\n    [ \n\n      sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; \n\n        sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ; \n\n        sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int \n\n      ] ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; \n\n        sh:hasValue true \n\n      ] \n\n    ]\n\n    [ \n\n      sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; \n\n        sh:hasValue true \n\n      ] ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; \n\n        sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ; \n\n        sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int \n\n      ] ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; \n\n        sh:hasValue true \n\n      ] \n\n    ]\n\n    [ \n\n      sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; \n\n        sh:hasValue true \n\n      ] ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ; \n\n        sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ; \n\n        sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int \n\n      ] ; \n\n      sh:property [ \n\n        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; \n\n        sh:hasValue true \n\n      ] \n\n    ]\n\n  )\n\n]\n\nWait, but the wageCutOffsetMonths and causesLoss are common to all three, so each of the three alternatives must include those properties. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wageCut and causesLoss can be included in each or case.\n\nYes, that's necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape would look like the above.\n\nNow, the other properties:\n\n- socialSecurityCountry must be Germany: so a property with sh:hasValue ff:Germany.\n\n- employmentStatus is Employee: sh:hasValue ff:Employee.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have an employment? Or is employmentStatus sufficient? The employmentStatus being Employee already indicates that they are an employee, so maybe that's enough. The third condition's part about being temporarily abroad under German social security is covered by the socialSecurityCountry being Germany.\n\nTherefore, the shape should include those two properties.\n\nAnother point: the employment must be within Germany or abroad with German social security. The socialSecurityCountry being Germany covers both cases, so that's already addressed.\n\nNow, check if there are any other conditions. The fourth condition mentions that the user must be legally recognized as an employee, which is enforced via the employmentStatus being Employee. The note about managing partners etc. needing a ruling is probably an external requirement, but since the ontology doesn't have those roles, we can only check the employment status.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include all the above constraints.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle code:\n\nThe shape name could be something like ff:InsolvenzgeldEligibilityShape, targeting ff:User.\n\nAlso, ensure that all prefixes are correctly declared.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:InsolvenzgeldEligibilityShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n      # Case 1: InsolvencyProceeding\n      [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n          sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:hasValue true\n        ]\n      ]\n      # Case 2: InsolvencyApplication with rejectedForLackOfAssets true\n      [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ;\n          sh:hasValue true\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n          sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:hasValue true\n        ]\n      ]\n      # Case 3: DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets true\n      [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ;\n          sh:hasValue true\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n          sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:hasValue true\n        ]\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  # Social Security in Germany\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Germany\n  ] ;\n  # Employment Status must be Employee\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Employee\n  ] ;\n.\n```\n\nI need to check if the data properties for wageCutOffsetMonths and causesLossOfEarnings are correctly applied. Also, ensure that the values for minInclusive and maxInclusive are in xsd:int. The ontology says wageCutOffsetMonths has domain ff:Event and range xsd:int, so that's okay.\n\nAdditionally, the employment status being ff:Employee is correct because that's the individual defined in the ontology.\n\nThis should cover all the conditions from the text. The fourth condition about the status determination via the Clearingstelle is captured by requiring the employmentStatus to be Employee, as that would be the result of such a determination. The exact method (like having a document) isn't modeled here but the ontology doesn't have such properties, so we can't represent it. The user must have that employment status, which is the outcome of the determination.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:InsolvenzgeldEligibilityShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  # Condition 1: Insolvency event\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n      # InsolvencyProceeding\n      [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n          sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n      ]\n      # InsolvencyApplication with rejection for lack of assets\n      [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n          sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n      ]\n      # DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obvious lack of assets\n      [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n          sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:int ;\n          sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:int\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Condition 2: Social security in Germany\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Germany\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Condition 3: Employee status\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Employee\n  ] ;\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the eligibility requirements of the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (IDLB B100019_LB_582429). Let's start by understanding the requirements provided.\n\nThe user mentioned two main conditions:\n1. The person must be unable to work (arbeitsunfähig) due to an insurance event (Versicherungsfall).\n2. The insurance events include work accidents (Arbeitsunfall), commuting accidents (Wegeunfall), and occupational diseases (Berufskrankheit).\n\nFirst, I need to map these conditions to the provided ontology. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the social benefit in question is likely represented by the individual ff:B100019_LB_582429, but since that's not listed in the ontology provided, maybe there's a typo or it's missing. Wait, checking the ontology's Individuals section, the closest might be ff:B100019_LB_102716305 which is labeled \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\". Hmm, maybe the user made a typo in the ID? Alternatively, perhaps the exact URI isn't present, but I need to proceed with the given info.\n\nWait, the user's text specifies the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_582429, but in the ontology, the existing benefits include ff:B100019_LB_102716305 and others. Since the ontology might not have that exact individual, but the SHACL needs to link to the benefit, perhaps I can use the provided benefit's URI as per the text. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, but since the user's instruction says to use only terms from the ontology, I need to check again. Wait, the user's text says the benefit is \"Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\", which might correspond to the ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (since that's labeled \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\"), but maybe not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the benefit is not listed, but the user expects to use the given name as per the text. Wait, but according to the ontology, there's no individual for that exact ID. Since the task requires using only terms from the ontology, maybe the user expects us to use the closest existing one or perhaps it's an oversight. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed by creating a shape that targets the ff:User node and references the benefits as per the ontology.\n\nWait, the SHACL shapes should target ff:User, so the shape will be for ff:User. The main conditions are:\n\n1. The user must be linked via ff:isEligibleFor to the specific benefit (assuming the benefit's URI is correct as per the text, but in the ontology, it's not present. Since the user's input includes the benefit's IDLB, maybe the actual URI is ff:B100019_LB_582429, but that's not in the ontology. Since the user's instruction says not to invent terms outside the ontology, perhaps there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the correct one is another benefit. Let me check again. The ontology lists ff:B100019_LB_102716305 as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\" which might be a different benefit. Alternatively, maybe the benefit is not present in the given ontology, but the user expects us to use another approach. Since the task requires using only the ontology terms, perhaps we can proceed by creating the shape even without the exact benefit individual, but the SHACL will still need to reference the correct benefit. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to use the label, but SHACL uses URIs. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the user's instruction says to model only what's clear. Since the benefit's URI isn't in the ontology, perhaps this part is ambiguous, so I can't model it. Wait, but the user's text says the benefit is 'Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld', which in the ontology might be represented as ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (since that's a statutory accident insurance benefit). Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the benefit to be part of the SHACL shape's condition, but without the exact URI, maybe it's better to proceed by assuming that the benefit's URI is correct as per the text, even if it's not in the ontology. But the user's instruction says not to invent terms outside the ontology. This is a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the ontology provided? Let me check again. Looking back, the ontology includes ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an Insurance individual, but not the benefit itself. Hmm, perhaps the benefit's exact URI isn't present, so maybe this requirement can't be fully modeled, but the user's instruction says to not model ambiguous parts. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed by using the Insurance's type, but the requirement is about eligibility for the benefit, so the exact benefit URI is needed. Since it's not present, perhaps this part is ambiguous and should be omitted. Wait, the user's text specifies the benefit's IDLB as B100019_LB_582429, which may not be present in the ontology. Since the task requires not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed, perhaps this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to use the closest existing benefit. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by assuming the benefit exists as an individual and proceed, even if it's not in the ontology. But the user's instruction says to not invent terms outside the ontology. Therefore, this might be an ambiguous part and should be excluded. Hmm, but the main conditions are about the user's state, so maybe the benefit's exact URI isn't necessary for the shape constraints, except to link eligibility. Alternatively, perhaps the SHACL shape's target is the benefit, but the user specified to target ff:User. \n\nLet me refocus. The main conditions are:\n\n1. The user must be unable to work (arbeitsunfähig), which in the ontology is the ff:unfitForWork data property on ff:EarningCapacity. The user's earning capacity must be linked to ff:UnfitForWork (the individual of EarningCapacity). \n\n2. The insurance event must be an Arbeitsunfall, Wegeunfall, or Berufskrankheit. \n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\n- Arbeitsunfall is the class ff:WorkAccident (sublcass of Event)\n- Wegeunfall is the class ff:CommutingAccident (subclass of Event)\n- Berufskrankheit is the class ff:OccupationalDisease (subclass of Event)\n\nSo the user must have an event of one of these types, and this event must be linked to their earning capacity's trigger (since the earning capacity's reduction is due to the event). \n\nWait, the user's condition is that the arbeitsunfähig is due to an insurance event. So the trigger for the earning capacity's state (UnfitForWork) must be one of those events. \n\nSo, the SHACL constraints would be:\n\n- The user must have an ff:hasEarningCapacity that is ff:UnfitForWork.\n- The ff:EarningCapacity's ff:triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of the allowed event types (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease).\n- Additionally, the user must be eligible for the specific benefit, but without the exact benefit URI, this is a problem. Wait, the user's text says \"Sie erhalten Verletztengeld... wenn Sie aufgrund eines Versicherungsfalls arbeitsunfähig sind.\" So the benefit is granted if the conditions are met. The SHACL is to validate that the user's data meets these conditions. The SHACL's shapes will ensure that the user has the required properties.\n\nWait, the SHACL needs to validate the user's data to determine eligibility. Therefore, the shape will have constraints that the user must have the earning capacity of UnfitForWork, and that the triggering event is one of the allowed types. Additionally, perhaps the benefit is linked via ff:isEligibleFor, but since the benefit's URI isn't present, maybe that's not necessary. The main constraints are the two conditions given. \n\nLet me structure the SHACL step by step.\n\nFirst, the shape targets ff:User. Since it's a node shape, the target is the user node.\n\nShape for the benefit eligibility:\n\n1. The user must have an ff:hasEarningCapacity that is exactly equal to ff:UnfitForWork. \n\nSo, a constraint:\n\n- Property: ff:hasEarningCapacity\n- Property Path: ff:hasEarningCapacity\n- sh:hasValue: ff:UnfitForWork\n- sh:message: \"User must be unfit for work.\"\n\n2. The triggering event of the earning capacity must be one of the allowed event types (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease).\n\nThe triggering event is linked via ff:triggeringEvent to the EarningCapacity. So, the EarningCapacity must have a ff:triggeringEvent that is an instance of one of those event classes.\n\nSo, the EarningCapacity (which is UnfitForWork) must have a triggeringEvent that is a subclass of one of the allowed events.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done via sh:property with a path to triggeringEvent and sh:class constraint.\n\nBut the EarningCapacity is a node that the user has via ff:hasEarningCapacity. So, we can use a nested constraint.\n\nAlternatively, using a property path: \n\nThe path would be ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent. Then, the class of that must be one of the allowed event types.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasEarningCapacity ] ; # Wait no, the user has the earning capacity via ff:hasEarningCapacity, so the earning capacity is the object. So the path from user to triggering event would be hasEarningCapacity / triggeringEvent.\n\nWait, the user has an earning capacity via ff:hasEarningCapacity. The earning capacity (which is UnfitForWork) has a triggeringEvent. \n\nTherefore, the path from the user to triggering event is: \n\nff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent \n\nSo, the constraint would be that the target of this path must be an instance of one of the allowed event types.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ \n        sh:inversePath ff:hasEarningCapacity ; \n        sh:and ( \n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ] ] \n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe better to use a nested shape.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested shape on the earning capacity node.\n\nFirst, the user must have an earning capacity of UnfitForWork. Then, that earning capacity must have a triggeringEvent that is an instance of one of the allowed events.\n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nThe main shape for ff:User includes a constraint on ff:hasEarningCapacity that must be UnfitForWork, and also, that earning capacity must have a triggering event of the correct type.\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n    sh:message \"User must have an earning capacity of UnfitForWork.\"\n]\n\nThen, for the triggering event:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n    sh:message \"The triggering event must be a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\"\n]\n\nAlternatively, using a nested shape for the earning capacity:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:class ff:UnfitForWork ; \n    sh:node [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n            sh:message \"Triggering event must be one of the allowed types.\"\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but the earning capacity node (UnfitForWork) must have a triggeringEvent. So the nested node shape on the earning capacity would require that it has a triggeringEvent of the correct type.\n\nAlternatively, since the earning capacity is a class instance (UnfitForWork is an individual of EarningCapacity), perhaps the triggeringEvent is a property of that instance. So the path is:\n\nThe user has a hasEarningCapacity to UnfitForWork, which in turn has a triggeringEvent that must be one of the event types.\n\nTherefore, the path from the user to triggeringEvent is hasEarningCapacity/triggeringEvent, and the class must be one of the three allowed.\n\nThus, the second constraint can be written as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ \n        sh:inversePath ( ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ) \n    ];\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    sh:message \"...\"\n]\n\nWait, no. The path from the user to the triggeringEvent is ff:hasEarningCapacity followed by ff:triggeringEvent. So the path is:\n\nff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent\n\nTherefore, the constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n    sh:message \"... must be an allowed event type.\"\n]\n\nAdditionally, we need to ensure that such an event exists. So, the triggering event must exist, so maybe a sh:minCount 1 on the path.\n\nWait, the user must have an earning capacity with a triggering event of the allowed type. So the path (hasEarningCapacity/triggeringEvent) must have at least one value of those classes.\n\nTherefore:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:message \"...\"\n]\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape would have two constraints:\n\n1. The earning capacity must be UnfitForWork.\n\n2. The triggering event of that earning capacity must be one of the allowed events.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the triggering event must exist (i.e., the earning capacity must have a triggering event), so maybe adding a sh:minCount 1 on the triggeringEvent property.\n\nWait, but the first constraint ensures that the earning capacity is UnfitForWork, which may require a triggering event. Since the ontology's EarningCapacity has a domain of Person and the triggeringEvent is a property of EarningCapacity, perhaps it's necessary to have the triggeringEvent present. \n\nAlternatively, the existence of triggeringEvent is part of the constraint. So in the SHACL, we can enforce that the path (hasEarningCapacity/triggeringEvent) has at least one value of the allowed classes.\n\nNow, for the SHACL syntax:\n\nThe shapes graph must be in Turtle, with the target being ff:User.\n\nThe SHACL shape would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n        sh:message \"The user must have an earning capacity of 'UnfitForWork'.\" ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"The triggering event must be a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\" ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the path is written as a path expression. The parentheses around the path indicate that it's a path. The sh:class constraint on a path that is an object property would require that the target node (the triggeringEvent) is an instance of one of the listed classes.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for the classes:\n\n- ff:WorkAccident is indeed a subclass of Event.\n\n- ff:CommutingAccident is also a subclass of Event.\n\n- ff:OccupationalDisease is a subclass of Event.\n\nThus, the sh:class constraint is correctly applied.\n\nAdditionally, the first constraint ensures that the user has an earning capacity of UnfitForWork, which is an individual of EarningCapacity.\n\nSo this should cover both conditions.\n\nI think that's all. The benefit's eligibility is determined by these two conditions, and the SHACL enforces them. The benefit's URI isn't needed because the constraints are about the user's state, not directly about the benefit itself, except that the SHACL is used to validate eligibility for the benefit. The benefit's details might be linked via other properties, but according to the problem description, the SHACL needs to validate the user data against the eligibility criteria, which are these two conditions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1: User must be unfit for work (arbeitsunfähig)\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n        sh:message \"User must have an earning capacity of 'UnfitForWork' (arbeitsunfähig).\"\n    ],\n    [\n        # Condition 2: Triggering event must be an allowed insurance case\n        sh:path (ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent) ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or ( \n                ff:WorkAccident \n                ff:CommutingAccident \n                ff:OccupationalDisease \n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Triggering event must be a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\"\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the eligibility requirements of the 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' (Social Assistance for Age and Reduced Earning Capacity) with the IDLB L100040_LB_8664880. The user data will be checked against this SHACL graph to determine eligibility. Let's start by breaking down the requirements from the given text.\n\nFirst, the user must be a person (ff:Person) targeting the node ff:User. The Social Benefit in question is the one with the ID L100040_LB_8664880. Looking at the ontology, I see that this specific benefit is not listed as an individual. Wait, checking the ontology again... Hmm, the provided ontology lists various SocialBenefit individuals like ff:L100040_LB_8665924 (Housing benefit) but not exactly the one mentioned here. Wait, the user's text says the benefit has IDLB L100040_LB_8664880. But in the ontology, the closest is L100040_LB_8665924 for Wohngeld. Maybe there's a typo, but since the user mentions the benefit's name as \"Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung\", which is Social Assistance, and looking at the ontology, there's an individual called SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance). Let me confirm. The ontology has:\n\nIndividual: ff:SocialAssistance\n    Types: ff:SocialBenefit \n\nYes, so probably that's the correct one. The text's benefit name matches \"Grundsicherung\" which is Social Assistance. So I'll use ff:SocialAssistance as the SocialBenefit node.\n\nThe eligibility criteria are:\n\n1. The person must be in need (not able to cover basic needs from income/assets).\n2. They must have reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII (ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true), OR\n3. They are over 18 and permanently fully work-reduced (erwerbsminderung) according to §43(2) SGB VI. The ontology has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently? Wait, the property 'reducesWorkProspectsPermanently' is a DataProperty of Disability, which might not directly map here. Alternatively, the EarningCapacity might be relevant. The requirement states \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert\", which means permanently fully reduced earning capacity. Looking at the ontology's EarningCapacity individuals: there's ff:UnfitForWork (which is a type of EarningCapacity) and ff:ReducedEarningCapacity. Maybe the person has an EarningCapacity that is either UnfitForWork (completely unable) and is permanent? The ontology's ff:UnfitForWork is a type of EarningCapacity, and there's a DataProperty ff:isPermanent on EarningCapacity. So perhaps the condition is that the person's EarningCapacity is UnfitForWork and isPermanent is true? Or maybe the person has a Disability that reduces work prospects permanently. Let me parse the German text again: \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI\". The 'dauerhaft' (permanent) and 'voll' (full) erwerbsminderung. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the EarningCapacity is of type ReducedEarningCapacity with reductionInPercent = 100% and isPermanent = true? Or perhaps the person has an EarningCapacity that is UnfitForWork (which might inherently mean 0% capacity) and it's permanent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is that the person's ff:hasEarningCapacity is linked to an EarningCapacity that is both 'unfitForWork' (ff:UnfitForWork) and 'isPermanent' (ff:isPermanent). \n\nWait, the ontology has an individual ff:UnfitForWork which is a type of EarningCapacity. So if the person has an EarningCapacity of UnfitForWork and it's permanent (isPermanent is true), that would satisfy the condition. Alternatively, maybe the 'isPermanent' is not needed because the UnfitForWork might already imply permanence. Hmm, the text says \"dauerhaft\" which means permanent, so we need to ensure that the earning capacity is permanent. \n\nThe third condition is for those over 18 who are either in an entry procedure and vocational training in a workshop for disabled people (Eingangsverfahren und Berufsbildungsbereich) or in an apprenticeship receiving a training budget. Looking at the ontology, there's the class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which is a subclass of Training. So if the person participates in such a training (ff:participates a Training that is an instance of ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) or is in an employment relationship (hasEmployment) where the employment is part of a training with a TrainingBudget. Wait, the text says \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\" So they are in an apprenticeship (Ausbildungsverhältnis) which is a type of Employment? Or maybe the Training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency?) or has a TrainingBudget. The ontology has ff:TrainingBudget as a SocialBenefit individual. Maybe the person has a hasEmployment that is part of a training that is funded by the TrainingBudget. Alternatively, the person's participates relation is to a Training that has a TrainingBudget. Not sure exactly, but looking at the ontology's properties, maybe the Training has a property ff:subjectToContract which links to VocationalTrainingContract, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true). The ontology has a DataProperty ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training. So if the person is participating in a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or is commissioned by the employment agency, that could satisfy the condition. \n\nNext, the social assistance is a secondary benefit. So the person must not have priority claims over other benefits. The ontology has the object property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links a person to a SocialBenefit. So the person must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to ff:SocialAssistance, meaning they don't have priority claims over this benefit. Alternatively, maybe they must not have any other benefits with higher priority. The SHACL shape would require that the person has no incoming edges to other benefits with higher priority, but perhaps the ontology doesn't model that. Since the text says \"nachrangige Leistung\" (secondary benefit), the applicant must have no other claims that take precedence. The ontology's ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is used here, so the person must have that property pointing to the SocialBenefit (ff:SocialAssistance). Wait, the property's description says: \"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So perhaps the person must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to ff:SocialAssistance. So the condition is that the person has an assertion ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ff:SocialAssistance. \n\nAdditionally, the person must not be able to cover their basic needs from income and assets. The ontology has a DataProperty ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds (if false, they can't cover). So the person's canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds must be false. \n\nAlso, the text mentions that claims against third parties (e.g., alimony) must be pursued first. If those claims are not fulfilled, then social assistance can step in. However, modeling this might be tricky. The ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause which points to a Disability, but maybe the inability to pursue claims is part of another property. However, since the SHACL must not include ambiguous requirements, and the text says \"Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere Unterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen.\" So the applicant must have pursued these claims, but how to model that? The ontology might not have properties for this, so perhaps this is an ambiguous requirement that we can't model. The user instructions say to not model requirements that are ambiguous or at discretion of third parties. So perhaps this part is excluded.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape must enforce:\n\n- Target is ff:User.\n\nConditions to satisfy any of the three eligibility categories (either age, permanent erwerbsminderung, or training):\n\nFirst condition: age (ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true)\n\nSecond condition: over 18 (ff:hasAge >=18) AND has EarningCapacity that is UnfitForWork and isPermanent is true (since dauerhaft).\n\nThird condition: over 18 AND (participates in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea OR participates in a Training commissioned by employment agency (commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true)).\n\nAlso, the person must have canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds false (can't cover needs).\n\nAdditionally, must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to SocialAssistance.\n\nWait, the 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' is a property from the person to the SocialBenefit, indicating that they have no priority claims over this benefit. So the person must have that property asserting that they don't have other benefits with priority. So in SHACL, it would require that the user has an object property assertion for hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with target SocialAssistance.\n\nLet me structure the SHACL shapes:\n\nThe main shape will be for ff:User, and the conditions are OR between the three eligibility paths plus the must-have conditions.\n\nFirst, the must-have conditions:\n\n- canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false (so the person cannot cover their needs).\n\n- hasNoPriorityClaimsOver SocialAssistance.\n\nThen, the three OR conditions:\n\nEither:\n\n1. aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true\n\nOR\n\n2. hasAge >=18 AND hasEarningCapacity is an instance of UnfitForWork (or equivalent) and isPermanent is true.\n\nWait, how to model the EarningCapacity part. The person must have an EarningCapacity that is of type UnfitForWork and isPermanent is true. In SHACL, this would be a path to the EarningCapacity's type and its properties.\n\nThe ff:hasEarningCapacity links to an EarningCapacity instance. So the shape would require that the person has at least one hasEarningCapacity where the target is an instance of UnfitForWork and has isPermanent = true.\n\nAlternatively, the EarningCapacity's isPermanent is a data property. So:\n\nshape for condition 2:\n\nperson must have:\n\nhasEarningCapacity [ a ff:UnfitForWork ; ff:isPermanent true ]\n\nSo in SHACL, this would be a property path:\n\nff:hasEarningCapacity / rdf:type = ff:UnfitForWork AND ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:isPermanent = true\n\nSimilarly, for the age part: hasAge >= 18.\n\nThird condition:\n\nhasAge >=18 AND ( participates in a Training that is either an EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true )\n\nThe Training could be via ff:participates property. So the person must have at least one participates link to a Training that is either an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nPutting all this together in SHACL:\n\nThe main shape for ff:User must have:\n\n- AND of must-haves (canCoverBasicNeeds false, hasNoPriorityClaimsOver SocialAssistance)\n\n- OR of the three eligibility paths.\n\nSo, the SHACL will have a shape that targets ff:User with the following components:\n\nFirst, the must conditions:\n\n1. ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false.\n\n2. The person has an object property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the target being ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nThen, the OR conditions:\n\nEither:\n\n- Condition A: ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true.\n\nOR\n\n- Condition B: (ff:hasAge >=18) AND (hasEarningCapacity that is UnfitForWork with isPermanent true)\n\nOR\n\n- Condition C: (ff:hasAge >=18) AND (participates in a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true)\n\nNow, structuring this in SHACL:\n\nThe main shape for ff:User will have a sh:or with three conditions (A, B, C).\n\nLet me start writing the Turtle:\n\nFirst, define the shapes graph. Let's assume the SHACL shapes are in the same namespace as the ontology, using ff: prefixes.\n\nThe shapes graph will have a shape for the User:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to SocialAssistance\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:SocialBenefit ;  # but more precisely, it should be exactly ff:SocialAssistance\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        # Condition A: aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n            sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ]\n        # Condition B: age >=18 and has EarningCapacity is UnfitForWork and isPermanent\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ] ;\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;  # at least one\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path rdf:type ;\n                        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n                    ] ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n                        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n                        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                    ]\n                ] ;\n            ] ]\n        ) ]\n        # Condition C: age >=18 and participates in qualifying Training\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ] ;\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:participates ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:or (\n                        [ sh:property [\n                            sh:path rdf:type ;\n                            sh:hasValue ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n                        ] ] ;\n                        [ sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                            sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n                            sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                        ] ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            ] ]\n        ) ]\n    ) .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the 'sh:or' within the 'sh:and' for Condition B's EarningCapacity might need to be structured properly. Let me check the syntax again.\n\nAlternatively, for the EarningCapacity part in Condition B:\n\nThe person must have at least one hasEarningCapacity where the EarningCapacity is of type UnfitForWork and has isPermanent true.\n\nIn SHACL, that can be expressed as a qualified value shape on the hasEarningCapacity path.\n\nSimilarly for the Training in Condition C, the participates must have at least one Training that is either of the specified type or has the commissioned property.\n\nI think this structure should work. Now, checking the data properties:\n\n- For the first condition (A), ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is a boolean, so setting it to true.\n\n- For the age checks, using hasAge >=18.\n\n- The hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must point exactly to SocialAssistance. The sh:hasValue ensures that the object is exactly that individual.\n\nWait, the sh:hasValue is used in the qualifiedValueShape for rdf:type, but here the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver's value must be SocialAssistance. So the path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must have a value exactly equal to ff:SocialAssistance. So the property shape for hasNoPriorityClaimsOver:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;  # this requires that all values are SocialAssistance, but since it's a single property, it's okay\n]\n\nAlternatively, since it's an object property, the value must be exactly that individual. So using sh:hasValue with the individual.\n\nPutting it all together, the Turtle code would look like the above. Let me make sure all the ontology terms are correctly referenced.\n\nWait, the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a DataProperty on Training, so in Condition C's qualifiedValueShape, the path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency must be present, so the Training must have that property set to true.\n\nAlso, in the Training part, the sh:qualifiedValueShape is applied to each object of participates. So the shape requires that at least one of the participates targets a Training that meets either of the two conditions (type or commissioned).\n\nI think this should cover all the requirements. Let me also check if there are any other constraints.\n\nThe social assistance being a secondary benefit also requires that the person has no priority claims over it. The hasNoPriorityClaimsOver property is correctly included.\n\nAdditionally, the person must be unable to cover their basic needs (canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false).\n\nI think that's all. Now, writing the final Turtle code.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Mandatory conditions\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Eligibility criteria OR conditions\n    sh:or (\n        # Condition A: Age limit reached\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n            sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ]\n        \n        # Condition B: Over 18 with permanent full earning capacity reduction\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ] ;\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path rdf:type ;\n                        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n                    ] ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n                        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n                        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] ]\n        ) ]\n        \n        # Condition C: Over 18 in qualifying vocational training\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ] ;\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:participates ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:or (\n                        [ sh:property [\n                            sh:path rdf:type ;\n                            sh:hasValue ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n                        ] ] ;\n                        [ sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                            sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n                            sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                        ] ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            ] ]\n        ) ]\n    ) .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL graph for validating eligibility for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld' (B100019_LB_102799515). The conditions given are:\n\n1. The user must have to supervise, care for, or nurse a child of their household due to the consequences of an insurance event (school or kindergarten accident).\n2. The child hasn't yet turned 12 years old.\n3. The user had a claim to wage or another financial benefit (like sick pay, unemployment benefit) before the care started.\n4. No other person living in the household can care for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to map these conditions to the provided ontology. Let's go through each condition one by one.\n\nStarting with the first condition: supervising, caring for, or nursing a child in the household because of an insurance event (school or kindergarten accident). The ontology has the ff:hasChild property to link a person to their child. The insurance event would be instances of ff:SchoolAccident or ff:KindergartenAccident, which are subclasses of ff:Event. The user must have a relationship here. Since the user is ff:User, we need to ensure that there's a connection from the user to an event that's either a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, and that the child is part of that event's consequences.\n\nWait, the event (accident) must be the cause. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent which links an event to something causing it. Hmm, maybe the child's need for care is linked via an event. Alternatively, the accident is the event, and the user must have a child affected by that event. Let me check the ontology properties again.\n\nLooking at properties, there's ff:hasEvent which can be linked from a person. Maybe the user has an event (the accident) via ff:hasEvent, and that event is of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. But the child is the one who had the accident. Alternatively, the child is linked to the accident as the cause. Wait, maybe the accident (event) is linked to the child via ff:causeOfDeath? No, that's for death. Hmm, maybe the accident is an event that the child has via ff:hasEvent. Then the user's child (via ff:hasChild) has an event (accident). \n\nAlternatively, the accident (event) must be linked to the child via some property. Since the accident is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, which is an instance of ff:Event. The child is the one involved in the accident, so perhaps the child is linked to the event via a property like ff:triggeringEvent or another? Maybe the user's child has an event of that type. So, the user's child must have an event of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, and that's why the user is providing care.\n\nBut how to represent that in SHACL? Let me think. The user must have a child (ff:hasChild), and that child must have an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident). So, in SHACL, we can have a path from the user to child via ff:hasChild, then the child has an event via ff:hasEvent, and that event is a subclass of either SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. So, the shape would check that the user's child has such an event.\n\nWait, but the user must be supervising the child due to the consequences of the accident. So perhaps the accident is the event that triggers the need for care. The user's role is to provide care because of that event. Maybe the user's employment status or earning capacity was affected by this event. Alternatively, the event (accident) is linked to the user's need for care.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user must have an event (the accident) that the child had, so that the user has to care for them. The ontology has ff:hasEvent which can be linked from a person, but maybe the child is the one who has the accident as an event, so the user must have a child that has such an event.\n\nAlternatively, the user's child has an event (the accident) which is of the correct type. Let me note that in the SHACL constraints.\n\nSecond condition: the child is under 12. The ontology has ff:hasAge as a data property on Person. So the child's age must be less than 12. The user's child (ff:hasChild) must have ff:hasAge < 12.\n\nThird condition: the user had a claim to wage or another financial benefit before the care started. The trigger for losing that benefit is the event (the accident). The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent which can be linked to ff:EarningCapacity or ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. Wait, the user's earning capacity might have been affected by the event. Alternatively, the user had an employment status before the accident. The property ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause points to a Disability, but that might not be relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, the user had an employment status before the accident. The user must have had an employment (ff:inEmployment true) or some other financial benefit like unemployment benefit. The condition mentions \"had a claim to wage or another financial benefit before the care started\". So maybe the user's employment status before the accident was such that they were earning, and the accident caused a loss. The ontology has ff:causesLossOfEarnings on ff:Event, which is a boolean. If the accident (event) caused loss of earnings, that could be a way to check that the user had a claim before. Alternatively, the user had an event (the accident) which caused a reduction in earning capacity (ff:EarningCapacity linked via ff:triggeringEvent to the event). The user's earning capacity before the accident must have been full, and now it's reduced.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have had an event (the accident) which caused a loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true). So the user's event (the accident) must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings set to true.\n\nWait, but the event is the accident (School or Kindergarten), so that event must have causesLossOfEarnings as true. So the user's child's accident event must have that property. Hmm, perhaps that's the way.\n\nFourth condition: no other household member can care for the child. The ontology has ff:sameHouseholdAs linking persons in the same household. The user must have no other person in their household (linked via sameHouseholdAs) who can provide care. The care need (ff:needsCare) of the child must not have a caregiverInHousehold. Alternatively, the user's household must not have any other person who can be a caregiver.\n\nWait, the child has a CareNeed (since CareNeed is a subclass of Event?), and the CareNeed must not have a caregiverInHousehold (ff:caregiverInHousehold) that is another household member besides the user. So the CareNeed must not have any caregiverInHousehold except the user, or none except the user. Or more precisely, there must be no other person in the household who can provide the care.\n\nAlternatively, the user is the only caregiver in the household. To model this, perhaps the CareNeed of the child must not have a caregiverInHousehold that is someone else in the household. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a CareNeed linked to their child, and the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user, and there are no other caregivers in the household.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky. Let's think of the CareNeed. The user's child has a CareNeed (needsCare). That CareNeed must have a caregiverInHousehold which is the user, and there must be no other person in the household (linked via sameHouseholdAs) who is also a caregiverInHousehold for that CareNeed.\n\nAlternatively, the user is the only possible caregiver in the household. So, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user, and there are no other people in the household (sameHouseholdAs) that are also linked to the CareNeed via caregiverInHousehold.\n\nHmm, perhaps the fourth condition can be modeled as: the CareNeed of the child must have no caregivers in the household except the user. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have no other household members who are caregivers for the child's care need. \n\nTo model this in SHACL, perhaps using a SPARQL constraint (since SHACL-Core might not support this directly). Wait, but the user specified to use only SHACL Core components. So maybe I can't use SPARQL. \n\nHmm, this might be a problem. Let me think again. The fourth condition says \"no other person living in the household can care for the child.\" So, the user must be the only one in the household who can provide the care. \n\nSo, the CareNeed of the child must have its caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user, and there must be no other person in the user's household (sameHouseholdAs) who is also a caregiverInHousehold for that CareNeed.\n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is exactly the user. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user, and there are no other caregivers. But the CareNeed can have multiple caregivers, but in this case, only the user can be. \n\nAlternatively, the user must be the only caregiver in the household. Since the user is the one in the household, perhaps the CareNeed has caregiverInHousehold set to the user, and there are no others. \n\nBut how to express that in SHACL Core? Maybe using a property path that checks that all caregivers in the household are the user. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must be the only person in the household who is a caregiver. So, for all persons in the user's household (including themselves), if they are caregivers for the child's care need, then they must be the user. \n\nThis requires a SHACL constraint that for any ?otherPerson in the user's household (via sameHouseholdAs), if they are a caregiverInHousehold for the child's care need, then they must be the user. \n\nBut SHACL Core doesn't support such complex constraints. Since we must use only SHACL Core, perhaps this condition can't be fully captured? Wait, the user's instruction says \"Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\" So if this condition can't be modeled with SHACL Core, maybe we can exclude it? But the fourth condition is crucial. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed must have its caregiverInHousehold exactly the user, and there's no other person in the household with that role. But how to check that. Maybe using inverse paths and cardinality.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold pointing to themselves, and there are no other caregivers in the household. But how to express that there are no other caregivers. Since SHACL Core doesn't support negative constraints beyond checking for existence, perhaps this is a problem. Maybe the condition can be partially modeled as the CareNeed has a caregiverInHousehold (the user) and there's no other caregiver. But without SPARQL, maybe we can't express the absence of other caregivers. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the fourth condition can't be modeled accurately with SHACL Core. However, the user's instruction says to not model ambiguous requirements. So perhaps we have to omit it? But the problem states that all conditions must be covered. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, the fourth condition says that no other person in the household can care for the child. Maybe the user must not have any other household member who is a caregiver for the child's care need. \n\nIn SHACL, perhaps we can require that the CareNeed does not have any caregiverInHousehold except the user. To do that, maybe using a property path that checks that all caregivers are the user. But SHACL doesn't have a way to say that all values must be a certain value. Alternatively, we can state that the caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user. \n\nWait, the CareNeed must have a caregiverInHousehold that is the user, and there must be no other caregivers. So the cardinality is exactly one, and that value is the user. \n\nSo, the path for caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user. \n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with:\n\nsh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold\nsh:minCount 1\nsh:maxCount 1\nsh:hasValue ff:User .\n\nWait, but ff:User is the node that's being targeted. Since the shapes graph targets ff:User, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user. So, for the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the value must be exactly the user. That would satisfy the fourth condition, assuming that there are no other caregivers. Because if there were another, the count would exceed 1. So this could work. \n\nTherefore, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly one and that is the user. \n\nAlright, moving on.\n\nNow, putting all conditions together:\n\n1. The user has a child (ff:hasChild) who is under 12 (child's age < 12).\n2. The child has an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) linked via ff:hasEvent (or via another property? Maybe the user's child has such an event, and the user has an employment status that was affected).\nWait, the first condition requires that the user is supervising due to the consequences of the accident. So the accident must be the reason for the need to care. So the accident must be an event that the child has. \n\nThe user's child (ff:hasChild) has an event of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. So:\n\nThe user's child (via ff:hasChild) must have an event (ff:hasEvent) where the event is a subclass of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\nSo in SHACL, the path would be:\n\n[ sh:path ( ff:hasChild ff:hasEvent ) ;\n  sh:nodeKind sh:Resource ;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path rdf:type ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:SchoolAccident, ff:KindergartenAccident\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, maybe using sh:qualifiedValueShapesDisjoint and sh:qualifiedMinCount 1.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:hasValue for the rdf:type. But perhaps using a SPARQL constraint here would be better, but again, we have to use SHACL Core.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with the rdf:type and checking that it's one of those classes.\n\nAlternatively, the user's child's event must be a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. So, the event must be of those types.\n\nSecond condition: the child's age < 12:\n\nThe user's child (ff:hasChild) must have ff:hasAge < 12.\n\nThird condition: the user had a claim to wage or other benefit before the care started. The event (accident) caused a loss of earnings. The accident's causesLossOfEarnings must be true.\n\nBut the event is the accident (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) linked to the child. So, the accident (event) has ff:causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nWait, the accident is the event. So the user's child's accident (the event) has ff:causesLossOfEarnings as true. \n\nThus:\n\nThe user's child's event (the accident) must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nFourth condition: the CareNeed (linked to the child via needsCare) must have caregiverInHousehold exactly the user.\n\nSo, the child's CareNeed (if exists) must have caregiverInHousehold exactly the user. Wait, the first condition requires that the user must be supervising due to the accident's consequences. So the child must have a CareNeed linked via needsCare, and that CareNeed has caregiverInHousehold as the user, and only the user.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape for ff:User must have these constraints.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shapes.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the user:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:Resource ;  # Ensure there is at least one child\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            # Constraints on the child\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:maxInclusive 11 ;  # Age must be less than 12\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path rdf:type ;\n                        sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n                    ] ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # CareNeed must exist and have caregiverInHousehold = user\n                sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                        sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # Caregiver is the user\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:maxCount 1 ;  # Exactly one caregiver, which is the user\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nWait, this might be getting too nested. Let me think again.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n1. The user must have at least one child (ff:hasChild). So sh:property on ff:hasChild with minCount 1.\n\n2. For each child:\n\n   a. The child's age < 12: check via ff:hasAge < 12 (so sh:maxInclusive 11).\n\n   b. The child must have an event that is either SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, and that event must have causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\n   c. The child must have a CareNeed (ff:needsCare) which has caregiverInHousehold exactly the user (so min and max count 1, and hasValue user).\n\nBut how to structure this in SHACL. Maybe using nested qualified shapes.\n\nAlternatively, using a separate shape for the child and linking it.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must have a child (ff:hasChild) with certain properties.\n\nSo:\n\nShape for the User:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # Must have at least one child\n    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;  # Each child is an IRI\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;  # At least one child must meet the following:\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        # Child must satisfy these properties\n        a sh:NodeShape ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Child's age must be <12\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n            sh:maxInclusive 11 ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Child has an event (School or Kindergarten accident)\n            sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;  # Must have at least one such event\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                a sh:NodeShape ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path rdf:type ;\n                    sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;  # Must be one of these types\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # Must cause loss\n                ]\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Child has a CareNeed with caregiver only the user\n            sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;  # Must have a CareNeed\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;  # Ensure the CareNeed meets criteria\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                a sh:NodeShape ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # Must be the user\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:maxCount 1 ;  # Exactly one caregiver (the user)\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nHmm, this seems better. Each child must have age <12, an event of the correct type with causesLossOfEarnings, and a CareNeed with caregiver exactly the user.\n\nWait, but the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user. So the CareNeed node's caregiverInHousehold property must have exactly one value which is the user. So in the qualifiedValueShape for the CareNeed, the caregiverInHousehold hasValue ff:User, and the count constraints.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe main shape for ff:User would have a property on ff:hasChild with all those constraints.\n\nNow, checking all conditions:\n\n1. The user must have a child (covered by hasChild minCount 1).\n\n2. The child's age <12 (maxInclusive 11).\n\n3. The child has an event that is a school/kindergarten accident (rdf:type check) and that event has causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\n4. The child has a CareNeed where caregiverInHousehold is exactly the user (hasValue and min/max count).\n\nThis seems to cover all conditions.\n\nNow, serializing this in Turtle. Also, note that the shapes graph must target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nWait, the main NodeShape must have sh:targetNode ff:User. So:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;  # Each child must be an IRI\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:maxInclusive 11 ;  # <12\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    a sh:NodeShape ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path rdf:type ;\n                        sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ;\n                    ] ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    a sh:NodeShape ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                        sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # Must be the user\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:maxCount 1 ;  # Only the user\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n.\n\nWait, but the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user. The current setup requires that the CareNeed has at least one caregiver (minCount 1), and that it's exactly the user (hasValue and maxCount 1). \n\nYes, this should work.\n\nI think that's the correct SHACL shape. Now let me check if all conditions are met:\n\n- First condition: User has a child who needs care due to accident. The CareNeed is present, and the accident (event) is the cause, which is covered.\n\n- Second condition: age under 12 is enforced via hasAge max 11.\n\n- Third condition: the event must be a school/kindergarten accident and causes loss of earnings (the user's previous earnings).\n\n- Fourth condition: caregiverInHousehold is only the user.\n\nYes, that should be correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:maxInclusive 11 ; # Child must be under 12 years old\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    a sh:NodeShape ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path rdf:type ;\n                        sh:in ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ; # Must be school/kindergarten accident\n                    ] ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ; # Accident caused loss of earnings\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:needsCare ; # Child requires care\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                    a sh:NodeShape ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                        sh:hasValue ff:User ; # Caregiver must be the user\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:maxCount 1 # Only the user can be caregiver\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n.\n```"

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Bildung und Teilhabe' benefit (L100040_LB_12280162). Let me start by understanding the requirements from the given text. \n\nFirst, the eligibility criteria mention that young people or their families must be receiving one of the listed benefits: Bürgergeld, Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen, or have low income. If they don't get those, they can have their individual claim assessed if they can't cover education and participation costs themselves. The age limit is up to 25 years, and social/cultural participation support is until 18.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the SocialBenefit individuals include Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931), Wohngeld (L100040_LB_8665924), Kinderzuschlag (B100019_LB_581863), Sozialhilfe (SocialAssistance), and Asylbewerberleistungen (AsylumSeekerBenefits). \n\nI need to create a SHACL shape targeting ff:User. The conditions require checking if the user or their family receives any of these benefits. Since the ontology has ff:receivesBenefit, I'll check if the user has a ff:receivesBenefit link to any of these. Also, if they don't, they might have an income check. But the text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which translates to families with low income. The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome on ff:Income, so maybe the family's income is below a certain threshold? But the exact threshold isn't specified, so I can't model that. Instead, maybe check if they have an income with certain properties. However, the user might need to have an income that's considered low. Since the ontology doesn't have a data property for low income directly, perhaps we can infer that if they don't have the listed benefits, they must have an income that can't cover the costs. The text says \"kosten nicht selbst decken können\", which might relate to ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit or similar. \n\nWait, the user must either be receiving one of the benefits OR have their income insufficient to cover the costs. But since the exact criteria for \"can't cover\" might not be in the ontology, maybe the SHACL should check for the presence of receiving one of the listed benefits OR having an income that is below a threshold. However, since the ontology doesn't have a direct way to express that threshold, perhaps the SHACL can only enforce the first part (receiving the benefits) and leave the income check as an optional condition that can't be fully captured here. But the user must be under 25 years old. The ff:hasAge data property is available, so we can set a max exclusive of 25. Also, the Teilhabe support until 18 for social/cultural participation. But since the benefit ID given is for 'Bildung und Teilhabe', maybe the main condition is age under 25. \n\nLet me structure the SHACL shape. The shape must be a SHACL NodeShape targeting ff:User. The conditions:\n\n1. User must be a ff:Person (already given as the target).\n2. Must be under 25 years old: ff:hasAge < 25.\n3. Either:\n   a. Receives one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen). These are specific SocialBenefit individuals. So the user's ff:receivesBenefit must be one of those.\n   b. OR, if they don't receive any of these, then their family's income is insufficient. But since the exact income criteria isn't clear, maybe the SHACL can't model this part unless there's a data property. The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome on Income. But how to represent \"family has low income\"? Maybe the user has an income where familyGrossIncome is below a certain value. However, without a threshold, perhaps this part is ambiguous and cannot be modeled. The text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which is subjective, so per the instructions, we can't model ambiguous requirements. So maybe the SHACL will only enforce the benefits part and the age, and the income check is excluded because it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is covered by the other benefits, so the main conditions are the listed benefits. The text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, ... hat die Möglichkeit, seinen individuellen Anspruch ... prüfen zu lassen.\" So the SHACL can't model the assessment possibility, but the benefit is granted if they have any of the listed benefits OR their individual claim is approved. But since the SHACL is for validation, maybe it's only checking the mandatory criteria. The user must be under 25, and either have the benefits or have their individual case approved. But since the approval is a process, maybe the SHACL just requires the benefits or the income condition (but we can't model income). \n\nHmm. The problem says to model only requirements that can be clearly assessed. The benefits are clear. The age is clear. The family income part is ambiguous. The text also mentions \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which might be a separate condition. Since the ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome, maybe the SHACL can check that the user's income has familyGrossIncome below a certain value. But the exact value isn't provided in the text, so that's ambiguous. So maybe we can't include that. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL must enforce:\n\n- User's age < 25 (ff:hasAge < 25)\n- User has at least one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, etc.) via ff:receivesBenefit\n- OR, if not receiving those benefits, then they must have an income where they can't cover the costs (but how to model that? Maybe using ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false? The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit as a data property on Person. If that is false, maybe that indicates they can't cover costs. Let me check the ontology's data property definitions.\n\nLooking at ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit: \"True if a person can cover the basic needs of themselves and the unemployed individuals in their benefit unit with their income, assets, and priority benefits, false otherwise.\" So if this is false, they cannot cover. So maybe the condition is:\n\nEither:\n\n- receives one of the benefits OR\n- (not receiving those benefits) AND (canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false)\n\nBut in SHACL, how to express OR between two paths? Maybe using sh:or with two shapes. \n\nAlternatively, the shape could require that either the user has one of the benefits OR the user has canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit as false. But also considering the age.\n\nWait, the problem says the user must be eligible if they or their family get one of the benefits, OR if they can't cover the costs (and thus have their claim assessed). Since the SHACL can't model the assessment process, maybe the condition is that either they have the benefits OR they have canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit false. That's possible. \n\nSo the conditions would be:\n\nAND:\n\n- hasAge < 25\n\n- OR:\n\n   - receivesBenefit one of the benefits (list the URIs)\n\n   - canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false\n\nWait, but the text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which may be part of the benefits list. Alternatively, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for family income being low, but canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false might indicate that the family can't cover needs, so that's the way to go.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would have:\n\nA shape for ff:User with:\n\n- sh:property for hasAge with sh:maxInclusive 24 (since under 25)\n\nThen, a sh:or with two conditions:\n\n1. The user has a receivesBenefit that is one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, etc.)\n\n2. The user has canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit = false\n\nAdditionally, the Teilhabe part mentions support until 18, but the benefit as a whole is up to 25. Since the benefit's ID is for 'Bildung und Teilhabe', the main condition is under 25. The Teilhabe part is a subset up to 18, but since the SHACL is for the overall benefit, we can ignore that as it's within the 25 limit.\n\nNow, let's check the ontology for the SocialBenefit instances:\n\nBürgergeld is B100019_LB_106311931\n\nWohngeld is L100040_LB_8665924 (since the text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\", which are two separate benefits, but the Kinderzuschlag is B100019_LB_581863. Wait, the listed benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (SGB II)\n\n- Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (as a combined condition?)\n\nWait the text lists:\n\n* Bürgergeld (SGB II)\n\n* Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\n\n* Sozialhilfe (SGB XII – Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt, Grundsicherung)\n\n* Asylbewerberleistungen (§§ 2 oder 3 AsylbLG)\n\n* Familien mit geringem Einkommen\n\nWait, the second bullet is \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" together. So the user must be receiving either Wohngeld OR Kinderzuschlag? Or both? The wording in German is \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\" which might mean that the combination is required. But since the benefit IDs are separate, perhaps the user must receive both? That complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the user just needs to have at least one of them. The text isn't entirely clear. Since the ontology has them as separate benefits, perhaps the condition is that the user has either Wohngeld (L100040_LB_8665924) OR Kinderzuschlag (B100019_LB_581863). Alternatively, they must have both. Since the text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" together in one bullet point, perhaps it's both. But that would be stricter. \n\nThe problem requires to model only what is clear. Since the user needs to be receiving one of the listed benefits, and the second bullet is \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\", maybe it's a single condition where the family receives both. Alternatively, maybe it's either one. The German text uses \"und\" which is \"and\", so perhaps both are required. But that might be too strict. Alternatively, maybe it's a joint benefit, but in the ontology, they are separate. Since the problem states \"transform into SHACL based on the description\", I have to go with the explicit listing. \n\nGiven that it's a bullet point with \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\", it might mean that the family must receive both, so the user must have both. Alternatively, maybe it's either/or. Since it's ambiguous, perhaps the SHACL should model that the user has at least one of them. But the problem says to not model ambiguous requirements. Since the exact requirement isn't clear, perhaps we have to treat it as \"either Wohngeld or Kinderzuschlag or both\". Alternatively, maybe the user must have one of the listed benefits, including the Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag as separate options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" is a combined condition, but since they are separate in the ontology, maybe the user just needs to have at least one of those two. To avoid ambiguity, perhaps the SHACL should require the presence of either Wohngeld or Kinderzuschlag. \n\nSo the benefits to check for are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931)\n\n- Wohngeld (L100040_LB_8665924)\n\n- Kinderzuschlag (B100019_LB_581863)\n\n- Sozialhilfe (SocialAssistance)\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen (AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n\nAdditionally, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition. Since that's not a benefit but an income status, perhaps it's covered by the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape will have a disjunction between receiving any of those five benefits or having canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit false, and age under 25.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User will have:\n\n- sh:property for hasAge with sh:maxInclusive 24 (since under 25 is up to 24.99 years, so 24 as integer).\n\nThen, a sh:or with two shapes:\n\nFirst shape (for benefits):\n\n- sh:path ff:receivesBenefit\n\n- sh:hasValue with the list of the five benefit URIs.\n\nSecond shape (for income condition):\n\n- sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit\n\n- sh:hasValue false\n\nWait, but the income condition is for families with low income, which may be the same as canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. So that's covered.\n\nWait, the \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition, so perhaps the user must be in a family with low income even if they aren't receiving the benefits. But how to model that? Since the ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome on Income, but without a threshold, we can't. So the only way is using canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL would check that the user has either the benefits or their family can't cover basic needs.\n\nSo the SHACL code would look like:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EducationAndParticipationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]  # Bürgergeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]     # Wohngeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]      # Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]       # Sozialhilfe\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ]   # Asylbewerberleistungen\n        ) ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:minCount 1 ] ]\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ; sh:hasValue false^^xsd:boolean ] ]\n    )\n.\n\nWait, no, the structure might need to use sh:or on the conditions. Maybe the shape has two properties, each with their own conditions, but using sh:or to combine them. Alternatively, using a nested sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to have a sh:or within the shape that includes two shapes: one requiring the benefits, the other requiring the canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit to be false. \n\nWait, let me structure it properly:\n\nThe shape must satisfy all properties except for the OR part. The age is a mandatory condition. Then, for the OR part between benefits and the income condition:\n\nThe overall shape would have:\n\n- A property for hasAge.\n\n- A property that is an OR between two conditions:\n\n   1. The user has at least one of the listed benefits (so a path ff:receivesBenefit with sh:minCount 1 and sh:hasValue for each of the benefits).\n\n   2. The user has canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit as false.\n\nAlternatively, the sh:or is on the conditions for the same path, but I think it's better to structure it as:\n\nThe shape includes a sh:or with two components:\n\nFirst component: a shape that requires the benefits.\n\nSecond component: a shape that requires canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false.\n\nSo:\n\nff:EducationAndParticipationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:hasValue (\n                  ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n                  ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n                  ff:B100019_LB_581863\n                  ff:SocialAssistance\n                  ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits\n              ) ;\n          ] ;\n        ] \n        [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n              sh:hasValue false^^xsd:boolean ;\n          ] ;\n        ]\n    ) ;\n.\n\nWait, but sh:or in SHACL is used in the context of a property. Alternatively, the entire shape's constraints use sh:or for the two conditions. But the age is a mandatory condition, so it must be outside the OR.\n\nAlternatively, the structure would be:\n\nThe main shape has:\n\n- The hasAge condition.\n\n- An sh:or between two conditions:\n\n   a. The benefits condition.\n\n   b. The canCover condition.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nff:EducationAndParticipationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:hasValue (\n                ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n                ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n                ff:B100019_LB_581863\n                ff:SocialAssistance\n                ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits\n            ) ;\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n            sh:hasValue false^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ]\n    )\n.\n\nBut the syntax for sh:hasValue with multiple values might need each to have a sh:hasValue, but that's not the case. Wait, sh:hasValue is for exact value matching. To check if the value is in a list, you need to have multiple sh:hasValue constraints, but that's not possible. Instead, you can use sh:in with a list. \n\nAh, right! So for the ff:receivesBenefit, instead of multiple sh:hasValue, we can use sh:in with a list of the five benefits. \n\nSo correcting that part:\n\nff:receivesBenefit\nsh:minCount 1 ;\nsh:in ( ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ff:B100019_LB_581863 ff:SocialAssistance ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits )\n\nThis way, the user must have at least one of those benefits.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe final SHACL should look like this:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EducationAndParticipationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:in ( ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n                    ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n                    ff:B100019_LB_581863\n                    ff:SocialAssistance\n                    ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ) ;\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n            sh:hasValue false^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ]\n    ) ;\n.\n\nThis should be valid SHACL Core. Checking for the conditions:\n\n- User must be under 25 (hasAge <=24).\n\n- Either they receive at least one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen) or their canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false.\n\nThis covers the requirements as per the text, avoiding ambiguous parts like exact income thresholds.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EducationAndParticipationShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:in ( ff:B100019_LB_106311931 \n                    ff:L100040_LB_8665924 \n                    ff:B100019_LB_581863 \n                    ff:SocialAssistance \n                    ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ) ;\n        ] ]\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n            sh:hasValue false^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ]\n    ) ;\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' benefit. First, I need to parse the given conditions and map them to the ontology provided. The target node is ff:User, so all shapes must be attached to that.\n\nStarting with the main eligibility criteria:\n\n1. **Disability and Support from Bundesagentur**: The user must have a disability and be receiving support from the Federal Employment Agency. Using the ontology, the disability is covered by ff:hasDisability set to true. The rehabilitation provider is ff:FederalEmploymentAgency, so the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider should point to that individual.\n\n2. **Participation in Specific Measures**: The user must be participating in one of the listed training programs. Looking at the ontology, these are subclasses of ff:Training. The ff:participates property links the user to a Training instance. The specific types like VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, etc., should be in the range. Using sh:oneOf to list the acceptable subclasses.\n\n3. **Voraussetzungen in the last 3 years**:\n   - At least 12 months insured (ff:socialSecurityDuration with monthsTotal ≥12). But wait, the ontology has a DataProperty for socialSecurityDuration which links to a Duration. The Duration's monthsTotal would need to be checked. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way here. Wait, the DataProperty ff:monthsWithinLast3Years on Duration might be relevant? Hmm, the user needs to have been insured for at least 12 months within the last 3 years. The ontology's ff:socialSecurityDuration has a range of ff:Duration, which has monthsTotal. But the requirement is 12 months in the last 3 years, so maybe the Duration instance's monthsWithinLast3Years should be >=12. Wait the ontology's DataProperty ff:monthsWithinLast3Years is on Duration, so perhaps the socialSecurityDuration's monthsWithinLast3Years must be ≥12. So the path would be ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ≥ 12.\n\n   - Entitled to unemployment benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842) and applied. The unemployment benefit is an individual, so maybe they must have an ff:isEligibleFor link to that benefit and have applied. But how to model \"currently applied\"? Maybe the ontology has a property for that? Alternatively, perhaps the user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus as RegisteredUnemployed or Unemployed, but the exact property isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the user has ff:hasEmploymentStatus as Unemployed and also is eligible for the unemployment benefit. Need to check ontology for unemployment benefit. The unemployment benefit is B100019_LB_576842. So maybe the user must have an ff:isEligibleFor to that, and also have applied, but the ontology doesn't have an applied property. Maybe just the eligibility is sufficient here? Or perhaps the user has an ff:receivedBenefit or similar. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The text says \"have a claim on unemployment benefit according to SGB III and have currently applied\". Since SHACL can't check the application status, maybe just the eligibility is required. So ff:isEligibleFor including the unemployment benefit.\n\n   - Entitled to SVG unemployment benefit. Similarly, the user must have ff:isEligibleFor ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG.\n\nThese three conditions are ORed, so we need a sh:or constraint with three conditions.\n\n4. **Exceptions**:\n   - If they are a vocational returnee (ff:isVocationalReturnee true), then the 3-year period requirement is waived. But how to model exceptions? Since exceptions modify the criteria, perhaps this is an alternative path where if the user has isVocationalReturnee true, then they don't need to meet the social security duration part. However, SHACL can't do conditional logic like that directly. So perhaps this exception means that the user can satisfy the overall condition either by meeting the original criteria or by being a vocational returnee (and other conditions). But the problem is that the exception is an alternative to one of the criteria (the 3-year requirement), so this might complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe the exception allows omitting the 3-year part if they are a returnee, so the 3-year conditions are optional in that case. This might require using sh:or with two paths: one for the original conditions and another for the returnee case. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think.\n\nThe exception says that for vocational returnees, the 3-year limitation doesn't apply. So the user can still be eligible even if they don't meet the social security part, provided they are a returnee. So the overall structure is:\n\nEither (original criteria) OR (isVocationalReturnee and the other parts? Or maybe the returnee allows skipping the 3-year requirement but still needs other parts?)\n\nWait the original criteria requires that one of the three conditions (12 months, unemployment benefit, SVG) must be met. The exception says that for returnees, the 3-year limitation (i.e., the requirement that the 12 months are within the last 3 years) is lifted. Wait the text says: \"die Eingrenzung der Vorbeschäftigungszeit auf 3 Jahre entfällt\". So the time period for the 12 months is not limited to 3 years. So for returnees, the 12 months can be anytime, not just in the last 3 years. \n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? Since SHACL can't have conditional constraints, perhaps we need to model this as an alternative path where if the user is a returnee, they just need to have 12 months of insurance without the 3-year restriction. But that would require separate conditions for the returnee case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the exception is that if the user is a returnee, they can meet the criteria by having 12 months of insurance in total (regardless of the 3 years), and the other options (unemployment benefit, SVG) still require the 3 years. But this complicates the structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exception is an OR condition where if the user is a returnee, they can skip the 3-year part. So the original 3-year conditions become optional if the returnee is true. But I'm not sure how to model this in SHACL. Maybe the exception allows the user to have either the original conditions or the returnee condition plus the other parts. \n\nThis might be getting too complex. Maybe the exception is better left out if it's not directly mappable. The user instructions say to not model ambiguous requirements. Let me check the problem statement again: \"Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\"\n\nThe exception about vocational returnees might require checking their status (isVocationalReturnee) and then allowing a different condition for the social security. Since that might not be straightforward in SHACL, perhaps it's better to exclude the exception unless it can be clearly modeled. Alternatively, perhaps the exception is an alternative path where if isVocationalReturnee is true, then the social security part isn't required. But that would mean the user can be eligible without meeting the original 3-year requirement. \n\nAlternatively, the main criteria have an OR between the three options, and the exception modifies one of them. For example, the first option (12 months) can be either within 3 years (for non-returnees) or any time (for returnees). So for the first condition, if the user is a returnee, the monthsWithinLast3Years isn't needed; instead, total months must be ≥12. But the ontology's ff:socialSecurityDuration's monthsTotal could be used here. \n\nHmm, this requires a conditional path, which SHACL can't do. Maybe the exception is too ambiguous and should be omitted. Let me see the problem statement again: \"Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\" Since the exception requires a different condition based on being a returnee, and SHACL can't model that, maybe it's better to omit the exception. Or perhaps the exception allows the user to bypass the 3-year part, so the first condition becomes just \"at least 12 months of insurance (without the 3-year limit) if returnee is true, else must be within 3 years\". Since SHACL can't do that, maybe we just include the exception as an optional condition where if they are a returnee, they can satisfy the first condition without the 3-year restriction. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exception is considered part of the main criteria's first condition. For example, the first condition is \"at least 12 months of insurance within the last 3 years OR (isVocationalReturnee AND at least 12 months of insurance in total)\". This way, the returnee can have 12 months without the 3-year restriction. \n\nTo model that, the first condition in the sh:or would be a sh:and with two parts: (isVocationalReturnee false AND monthsWithinLast3Years ≥12) OR (isVocationalReturnee true AND monthsTotal ≥12). But this might be complicated. Alternatively, the first condition could be a sh:or between two paths: \n\nEither:\n\n- (ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years >=12 AND NOT isVocationalReturnee)\n\nOR\n\n- (ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsTotal >=12 AND isVocationalReturnee)\n\nBut SHACL can't do that in a single constraint. It might require nested shapes or using sh:or and sh:and in a more complex way. \n\nAlternatively, since the exception is an additional case, maybe it's better to model the exception as an OR with the entire main criteria. For instance, the user can either meet the original criteria, or be a vocational returnee and meet other conditions (like the other two options in the 3-year criteria). But this is getting too involved. Since the user might not be able to clearly model this, perhaps the exception should be excluded, as per the rules. Wait the problem says to not model ambiguous requirements. Since the exception requires a conditional path which isn't directly representable in SHACL Core, maybe it's better to omit the exception. The user instructions say to not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. So perhaps the exceptions are ambiguous and should be omitted.\n\nAlternatively, the first exception is about the 3-year period being lifted for returnees. So for them, the social security duration's monthsTotal must be >=12 (without considering the last 3 years). The main criteria's first condition (the 12 months in 3 years) would be replaced for returnees. So in SHACL terms, maybe the user must either:\n\n- (isVocationalReturnee is false AND (the original 3 conditions)), OR\n\n- (isVocationalReturnee is true AND the first condition is 12 months total, and the other conditions still apply?)\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the exception is better left out for now, as per the instructions. The problem states to not model ambiguous requirements, so perhaps the exceptions are considered too ambiguous. Let me proceed with the main criteria first, and see if the exceptions can be addressed.\n\nNext part: the exceptions mention that the Vorbeschäftigungszeit (pre-employment period) conditions can be entirely waived if within the last year before the measure started, they have a recognized qualification. This is the second exception. Again, how to model this?\n\nThe user needs to have obtained a qualification (Ausbildungsabschluss) in the last year. The qualification must correspond to an approved vocational training. The ontology has ff:Training subclasses like VocationalTraining. The user's participation in such a training (ff:participates in a VocationalTraining) might be part of this, but the exact properties aren't clear. Maybe they need an ff:hasEvent of type MoveToGermany? Not sure. Alternatively, the user must have an ff:hasEvent that is an educational qualification obtained within the last year. The ontology has ff:hasEvent with domain Person, so maybe an event indicating the qualification. But I don't see a specific class for qualifications. The Training subclasses might include the type, so if they have a training that is a VocationalTraining and the duration's monthsTotal is within last year, but it's unclear. Since this is also ambiguous without clear ontology terms, perhaps this exception should also be omitted.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the main criteria first:\n\nNow structuring the SHACL shape:\n\nStart with a shape for ff:User, which targets the node <ff:User>.\n\nThe shape will have constraints:\n\n1. Disability and Rehabilitation Provider:\n\n- Must have ff:hasDisability true.\n\n- Must have ff:hasRehabilitationProvider exactly ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nThese are straightforward with sh:hasValue and sh:property.\n\n2. Participation in a valid measure:\n\n- ff:participates must link to a Training subclass instance. The acceptable subclasses are:\n\n- ff:VocationalTraining,\n\n- ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea,\n\n- ff:School (since School is a Training subclass, but does it fit? The text mentions \"berufsbildende Schule\" which is covered by School),\n\n- ff:TrainingBudget? No, that's a benefit. Wait the measure includes \"berufliche Weiterbildung\" which might be under Training, but need to see ontology. The Training class includes VocationalTraining, EntryProcedure..., School (maybe for school-based training), and others. So the allowed subclasses would be all subclasses of Training except those not listed. The text lists:\n\n- Berufsausbildung → VocationalTraining,\n\n- Berufsvorbereitung → perhaps a subclass of Training? The ontology has EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which might include that,\n\n- individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung → maybe under VocationalTraining,\n\n- Eingangsverfahren (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea),\n\n- berufliche Weiterbildung → maybe another subclass, but in the ontology, Training has VocationalTraining, EntryProcedure..., School, etc. Maybe the user just needs to be participating in any Training, but the text specifies specific types. Looking at the ontology, the only Training subclasses are VocationalTraining, EntryProcedure..., School. The \"berufliche Weiterbildung\" might be part of VocationalTraining or another subclass not listed. Since the ontology doesn't have an explicit class for that, perhaps the sh:oneOf uses the existing subclasses. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to be in any Training. The problem states to use only terms from the ontology. So the allowed classes are the existing Training subclasses except maybe the generic Training itself? The text says \"eine der folgenden Maßnahmen\", so the listed ones are the allowed ones. From the ontology, the Training subclasses are VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, School. The \"individual betriebliche Qualifizierung\" (individual company-based qualification) isn't a class here, but maybe it's under VocationalTraining. Since the ontology may not cover all specifics, perhaps the user should have ff:participates to any Training instance (since the allowed subclasses are part of the Training class). However, the exact match needs to be made. Since the problem requires using only ontology terms, and the allowed measures are subclasses of Training, the sh:oneOf would include the listed subclasses from the text mapped to ontology classes. Let's see:\n\nThe listed measures:\n\n- Berufsausbildung → VocationalTraining,\n\n- Berufsvorbereitung und Grundausbildung → maybe EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea,\n\n- individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung in Unterstützter Beschäftigung → perhaps another Training subclass not present. Since ontology doesn't have that, perhaps it's under VocationalTraining,\n\n- Eingangsverfahren und Berufsbildung in Werkstatt für behinderte → EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea,\n\n- berufliche Weiterbildung → maybe VocationalTraining or another. Given the ontology's limits, perhaps we can only include the existing subclasses. So the sh:oneOf will include VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, School (for the school-based qualifications). The other options may not be explicitly in the ontology, so perhaps they're included under Training. Alternatively, since the ontology's Training class includes all these via subclasses, maybe just requiring participation in a Training is sufficient. However, the text specifies exact measures. Since some are not in the ontology, maybe the best approach is to list the available ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must participate in a Training instance, which is sufficient. Since the exact types may not all be present, but the main point is that it's a Training, so the constraint can be:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:participates; sh:minCount 1; sh:class ff:Training ]\n\nBut the text requires specific types. Since the ontology doesn't have all the required subclasses, perhaps the exception is that we can't model that exactly, so proceed with the available ones. Alternatively, the problem might consider that \"Maßnahme\" refers to any Training, so proceed with that.\n\n3. The three OR conditions for the 3-year period:\n\nThe user must have at least one of the following:\n\na. social security duration within last 3 years >=12 months:\n\nSo ff:socialSecurityDuration's monthsWithinLast3Years >=12.\n\nThis would be modeled as:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:socialSecurityDuration ]/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years; sh:minInclusive 12 ]\n\nWait, no. The socialSecurityDuration is an object property from Person to Duration, so the path would be:\n\nff:socialSecurityDuration / ff:monthsWithinLast3Years >=12.\n\nWait, the DataProperty ff:monthsWithinLast3Years is on Duration. So the path is:\n\nff:socialSecurityDuration (object property) to a Duration, then that Duration has ff:monthsWithinLast3Years.\n\nSo the path expression is:\n\nsh:property [ sh:path [ ff:socialSecurityDuration / ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ] ; sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:integer ]\n\nb. Entitled to unemployment benefit and applied. Assuming eligibility is sufficient:\n\nff:isEligibleFor includes ff:B100019_LB_576842 (unemployment benefit) and has applied. Since application isn't in the ontology, maybe just the eligibility is enough.\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ]\n\nc. Entitled to SVG unemployment benefit:\n\nff:isEligibleFor includes ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG.\n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor; sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ]\n\nThese three are ORed, so:\n\nsh:or ( [\n    sh:property [ ... condition a ... ],\n    sh:property [ ... condition b ... ],\n    sh:property [ ... condition c ... ]\n])\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User would have:\n\n- A sh:property for hasDisability with sh:hasValue true.\n\n- A sh:property for hasRehabilitationProvider with sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n- A sh:property for participates that requires the target to be a Training instance (or specific subclasses).\n\n- A sh:or for the three conditions (a, b, c).\n\nNow, for the exceptions, since they are ambiguous and involve conditions not easily modeled, perhaps they are omitted as per the instructions.\n\nNow, assembling the Turtle code.\n\nFirst, the prefixes:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nDefine the shape:\n\nff:UserEligibilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:integer\n        ] ] ,\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n        ] ] ,\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n        ] ]\n    )\n.\n\nWait, but the socialSecurityDuration is an object property, so the path must traverse to it. So the path is ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years. But in SHACL, the path is written as a sequence. So the first property in the or is correct.\n\nAlso, check that all properties are required. For example, the participates must have at least one Training instance.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have at least one of the three OR conditions.\n\nThis should cover the main criteria. The exceptions are not modeled due to ambiguity.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserEligibilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        # 12 months social security in last 3 years\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:integer\n        ] ] ,\n        # Entitled to unemployment benefit and applied\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n        ] ] ,\n        # SVG unemployment benefit entitlement\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n        ] ]\n    )\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the given social benefit eligibility conditions. The benefit is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' with ID B100019_LB_582404. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text provided.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1. The person must be legally insured under statutory accident insurance.\n2. Their earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20%:\n   - Due to one or more insurance events,\n   - Beyond the 26th week after the insurance event,\n   - And the reduction must be permanent (implied since it's beyond 26 weeks? Or maybe the duration is part of the condition? The text says \"over the 26th week\", so maybe the reduction must persist beyond that point, which might be captured by the weeksTotal or something else. Wait, the exact phrasing in German is \"über die 26. Woche nach dem Versicherungsfall hinaus\". So the reduction must exist beyond the 26th week, meaning it's lasting longer than 26 weeks. Maybe the duration needs to be at least 27 weeks? Or that the current state is after 26 weeks?\n\nThe SHACL needs to validate the user data (targeting the ff:User node) based on these conditions. Let me look at the ontology to find the relevant properties and classes.\n\nFirst, the user must be insured by StatutoryAccidentInsurance. The ontology has ff:hasInsurance which links a person to an insurance. The insurance instance here should be StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So, the user must have an insurance of type ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nNext, the earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20%. The ontology has ff:EarningCapacity, and the property ff:reductionInPercent. The earning capacity must be linked to the user via ff:hasEarningCapacity. The value of ff:reductionInPercent must be >= 20. Also, the earning capacity must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity (since FullEarningCapacity would not have reduction).\n\nThe reduction must be due to one or more insurance events. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent for EarningCapacity, which links to an Event. The insurance events are subclasses of ff:Event, such as WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc. So the triggering event(s) must be an instance of an insurance event. Wait, the ontology has the Insurance class, but perhaps the events under statutory accident insurance are the ones like WorkAccident, SchoolAccident, etc. The triggeringEvent must be one of those.\n\nAlso, the reduction must be beyond the 26th week. The duration since the event needs to be more than 26 weeks. The ontology has ff:reductionDurationInWeeks on EarningCapacity, which is the duration in weeks. Wait, but the triggeringEvent has a ff:hasDate. The current time minus the event's date should be more than 26 weeks? But SHACL can't handle time calculations. Alternatively, maybe the duration of the reduction is beyond 26 weeks, so the ff:reductionDurationInWeeks must be >=27? Not sure. Alternatively, the event's date must be before a certain time, but that's not possible in SHACL without SPARQL. Since the user is providing their data, maybe the data includes the duration? Alternatively, perhaps the ff:isPermanent property on EarningCapacity must be true? Because if the reduction is permanent, that implies it's beyond 26 weeks. But the condition says \"over the 26th week\", which might just mean that the reduction is ongoing beyond that period. The exact mapping here is a bit tricky.\n\nLooking at the ontology, EarningCapacity has ff:isPermanent which is true if the condition is permanent. So if the reduction is permanent, that would satisfy the duration condition. The user's EarningCapacity must have isPermanent = true, and reductionInPercent >=20, and triggered by an insurance event.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\n1. User must have ff:hasInsurance ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n   - So a shape that requires hasInsurance with value StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n2. User must have an EarningCapacity linked via hasEarningCapacity, which is of type ReducedEarningCapacity (or just ensure it's not FullEarningCapacity). But maybe the type isn't necessary since the properties will indicate it's reduced. However, maybe the EarningCapacity instance must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity. Looking at the ontology, there's an individual ff:ReducedEarningCapacity. So the EarningCapacity should be of that type.\n\n3. The EarningCapacity must have reductionInPercent >=20.\n\n4. The EarningCapacity's triggeringEvent must be an instance of an insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.), which are subclasses of Event. So the triggeringEvent must be of some Event subclass related to insurance. Alternatively, since any Event could be a cause, but the insurance events are those covered by the insurance. The ontology's Event subclasses include WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc. So the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of those.\n\n5. The reduction must be beyond 26 weeks. Since SHACL can't compute dates, maybe the ff:reductionDurationInWeeks must be greater than 26? Or the isPermanent is true. The exact condition is \"über die 26. Woche hinaus\", which could mean that the duration is more than 26 weeks. So maybe the reductionDurationInWeeks must be at least 27. But how to express that in SHACL. The DataProperty ff:reductionDurationInWeeks is an integer. So the value should be >=27. Alternatively, if the isPermanent is true, that implies it's beyond 26 weeks, but that might not be the case. The condition says \"over the 26th week\", so it's a duration condition. Since SHACL can't calculate time from dates, perhaps the data must include the duration, so the reductionDurationInWeeks must be >=27.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe shape will have constraints:\n\n- For the User node:\n\n  - Must have ff:hasInsurance with value StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n  - Must have an EarningCapacity linked via ff:hasEarningCapacity, which:\n\n    - is a ReducedEarningCapacity (or at least not FullEarningCapacity).\n\n    - has ff:reductionInPercent >=20.\n\n    - has ff:triggeringEvent that is an instance of an insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.), so the triggeringEvent must be of a class that is a subclass of Event (but more specific?).\n\n    - has ff:reductionDurationInWeeks >=27, or isPermanent = true? Need to check the exact requirement.\n\nWait, the condition says \"über die 26. Woche nach dem Versicherungsfall hinaus\". So after the 26th week, meaning the duration since the event is more than 26 weeks. The ff:reductionDurationInWeeks is the duration for which the earning capacity has been reduced. So that must be greater than or equal to 27 weeks. Therefore, the reductionDurationInWeeks should be >=27.\n\nSo, the shape constraints would be:\n\n1. ff:hasInsurance must have exactly one value equal to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n2. The user's EarningCapacity (via hasEarningCapacity) must:\n\n   a. Be of type ReducedEarningCapacity (or at least not FullEarningCapacity). Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient that the reductionInPercent is present and >=20, but to be precise, maybe the type is better.\n\n   b. reductionInPercent >=20.\n\n   c. reductionDurationInWeeks >=27.\n\n   d. The triggeringEvent is an instance of an insurance-related event (like WorkAccident, SchoolAccident, etc.), so the triggeringEvent must be a member of some subclass of ff:Event that is covered by the insurance. Since the insurance events are those covered by the statutory accident insurance, which include WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc., the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of these.\n\n   So the triggeringEvent must be a member of one of those subclasses. To model this in SHACL, we can use a sh:class constraint on the triggeringEvent to require that it's a subclass of those specific event types. Alternatively, since we can't list all possible subclasses, perhaps we can look for events that are in the insurance's scope, but the ontology might not have that info. Alternatively, the triggeringEvent must be an instance of any subclass of ff:Event that is considered an insurance case. Since the user's data would have the specific event type, maybe the triggeringEvent's type must be one of the event subclasses (like WorkAccident, etc.). So the shape for the triggeringEvent must have sh:class [ sh:in (ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease) ].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any Event is acceptable as a triggering event for the insurance, but the user's event must be of the type covered by statutory accident insurance. Since the ontology defines these events as subclasses of Event, perhaps it's sufficient to require that the triggeringEvent is an instance of one of these specific event types.\n\nPutting this all into SHACL shapes:\n\nThe main shape will be for the User node, with constraints on hasInsurance, hasEarningCapacity, and then the EarningCapacity's properties.\n\nFirst, the User shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n  ],\n  [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:ReducedEarningCapacity ;  # or maybe not necessary, but better to ensure type\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n      ],\n      [\n        sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;  # >=27 weeks\n      ],\n      [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path rdf:type ;\n          sh:in (ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease) ;\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n\nWait, but SHACL's node constraints can be a bit tricky. Let me structure it properly.\n\nAlternatively, the hasEarningCapacity must point to a node which has:\n\n- reductionInPercent >=20,\n\n- reductionDurationInWeeks >=27,\n\n- has a triggeringEvent that is an instance of one of the allowed Event subclasses.\n\nSo the node shape for EarningCapacity would have properties on its triggeringEvent. But how to structure this in SHACL.\n\nThe correct way is to have a nested NodeShape for the EarningCapacity. So:\n\nThe main shape for the User requires hasEarningCapacity to have a node that meets certain conditions.\n\nSo:\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ;  # maybe redundant but ensures it's an EarningCapacity\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # must be >=27\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [  # the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of the event types\n          sh:in (ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease)\n        ] ;\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n\nWait, the triggeringEvent's class must be one of those. So the node shape for triggeringEvent should have sh:class with in those.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property on the triggeringEvent to check its rdf:type.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe triggeringEvent must be of a type in the list. So the sh:class constraint on the triggeringEvent path.\n\nWait, the sh:class constraint can be applied to the path. So for the triggeringEvent's type:\n\nThe path is ff:triggeringEvent, and then the node pointed by that must have rdf:type in (those classes). So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:node [\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path rdf:type ;\n      sh:in (ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease) ;\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nThe UserShape requires:\n\n- hasInsurance must have exactly StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n- hasEarningCapacity must point to an EarningCapacity node that:\n\n   - has reductionInPercent >=20,\n\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27,\n\n   - has a triggeringEvent that is an instance of one of the allowed event types.\n\nAlso, the EarningCapacity must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity? The ontology has ReducedEarningCapacity as an individual, so maybe the EarningCapacity node must be of that type. The User's hasEarningCapacity should point to an instance of ReducedEarningCapacity.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of reductionInPercent and isPermanent could imply it's reduced. But to be precise, since there's an individual ReducedEarningCapacity, it's better to enforce that the EarningCapacity is of that type. So the sh:class on the hasEarningCapacity path should be ff:ReducedEarningCapacity.\n\nWait, looking at the ontology, there's ff:ReducedEarningCapacity as an instance of EarningCapacity. So the EarningCapacity instance must be that individual? Or can it be a subclass? Wait, in the ontology, ReducedEarningCapacity is an individual (instance), not a class. So the EarningCapacity node must be the same as ff:ReducedEarningCapacity? That might not be correct. Because EarningCapacity is a class, and instances can have properties. Maybe the EarningCapacity instance doesn't have to be exactly ReducedEarningCapacity but must be an instance of EarningCapacity and have certain properties. Wait, the ontology has ff:ReducedEarningCapacity as an individual, which is an instance of EarningCapacity. So perhaps the EarningCapacity instance must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity (the individual). But that would require the EarningCapacity to be exactly that individual, which might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the EarningCapacity instance has a type that is a subclass of EarningCapacity, but the ontology doesn't define other classes except the individual instances. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the EarningCapacity's class isn't important as long as it has the required properties. Since the user's data can have an EarningCapacity instance with those properties without needing to be exactly the ReducedEarningCapacity individual. So maybe we can omit the sh:class for ReducedEarningCapacity and just rely on the properties. Because if the reductionInPercent is set, then it's a reduced earning capacity. The ontology's individual ReducedEarningCapacity might just be a label, but the actual instances can be any EarningCapacity with those properties. So perhaps we can skip the sh:class constraint for ReducedEarningCapacity.\n\nTherefore, adjusting the shape to not require the type, but just the properties.\n\nFinal shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n  ],\n  [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n      ],\n      [\n        sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n      ],\n      [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n          a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type ;\n            sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n          ]\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n\nWait, but the triggeringEvent's node must be of one of those event types, so the inner node shape for triggeringEvent requires that the rdf:type is in the list.\n\nAlternatively, the triggeringEvent's class can be checked via sh:class:\n\n[\n  sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]\n]\n\nYes, that's better. Because sh:class checks the rdf:type of the object.\n\nSo correcting that part:\n\nThe triggeringEvent's path should have sh:class with the in list.\n\nThus, the shape becomes:\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n  ],\n  [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n      ],\n      [\n        sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n      ],\n      [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:WorkAccident ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n\nThis should cover all the conditions:\n\n- User has statutory accident insurance.\n\n- Their earning capacity is reduced by at least 20%, has been so for at least 27 weeks (beyond 26), and the triggering event is one of the listed insurance events.\n\nNow, check the ontology again for the event types. The insurance events covered by statutory accident insurance include WorkAccident, SchoolAccident, KindergartenAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease. Are there others? Let me check the ontology:\n\nLooking at the Event subclasses:\n\n- CommutingAccident (Wegeunfall)\n\n- SchoolAccident (Schulunfall)\n\n- KindergartenAccident (Kindergartenunfall)\n\n- OccupationalDisease (Berufskrankheit)\n\n- WorkAccident (Arbeitsunfall)\n\nThese are the ones listed. So those are the allowed types for the triggering event.\n\nThis should be the correct SHACL.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Must have statutory accident insurance\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n  ],\n  [\n    # Earning capacity requirements\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        # At least 20% reduction in earning capacity\n        sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n      ],\n      [\n        # Reduction must persist beyond 26 weeks (>=27 weeks)\n        sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n      ],\n      [\n        # Triggering event must be an insurance-covered accident/disease\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n          sh:in (\n            ff:WorkAccident \n            ff:SchoolAccident \n            ff:KindergartenAccident \n            ff:CommutingAccident \n            ff:OccupationalDisease\n          )\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung' benefit, which has the ID B100019_LB_103817036. Let me start by breaking down the requirements provided.\n\nFirst, the benefit's conditions are listed in German, so I need to translate those into the SHACL constraints. Let me go through each condition one by one and map them to the ontology provided.\n\n1. **Sie und die von Ihnen begleitete Person mit Behinderung sind gesetzlich krankenversichert.**\n   - Both the user and the person they're accompanying must have statutory health insurance.\n   - The ontology has ff:hasInsurance, and ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance is an individual of ff:Insurance.\n   - So, the user (ff:User) must have an insurance that is exactly ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance. Similarly, the accompanied person (linked via some property) must also have this insurance. Wait, but how to reference the accompanied person? The ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold under CareNeed, but maybe the user is linked via another property. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user's relationship is captured via ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember, but the exact property isn't clear yet. Need to think more on that later.\n\n2. **Die zu begleitende Person wird stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt.**\n   - The person being accompanied is receiving inpatient treatment. \n   - The ontology has ff:MedicalAccompaniment as a subclass of Event. Wait, but the MedicalAccompaniment is an event. Also, the 'stationäre Mitaufnahme' is part of the condition. The ontology's ff:inPatientCoAdmission is a data property of MedicalAccompaniment, which is true if they are admitted as a co-accompanying person for inpatient treatment. Wait, maybe the event here is the MedicalAccompaniment, which needs to have inPatientCoAdmission true. Also, the person being accompanied must be linked to this event somehow.\n\n3. **Die stationäre Mitaufnahme als Begleitperson ist medizinisch notwendig. Gleichgestellt ist eine ganztägige Begleitung, das heißt, die Zeit Ihrer Anwesenheit im Krankenhaus beträgt zusammen mit Ihrer Anreise- und Abreisezeit mindestens 8 Stunden.**\n   - The accompaniment must be medically necessary and either the inpatient admission or the total time (including travel) is at least 8 hours.\n   - The ontology has ff:fullDayAccompaniment, a data property of MedicalAccompaniment, which is true if it exceeds 8 hours including travel. So, the MedicalAccompaniment event must have fullDayAccompaniment as true. Additionally, the necessity is implied by the presence of this property, perhaps?\n\n4. **Sie haben einen Verdienstausfall.**\n   - The user has a loss of earnings. \n   - The ontology has ff:causesLossOfEarnings on Event. Maybe the triggering event (like the medical accompaniment) must cause this loss. Alternatively, there's a data property on the user's earning capacity? Wait, ff:EarningCapacity has ff:unfitForWork, but that's about being unfit. Alternatively, the event (like the MedicalAccompaniment) must have causesLossOfEarnings true. The user's earning capacity might be linked via ff:triggeringEvent to this event, but not sure. Alternatively, the user's EarningCapacity could have some property, but the exact path needs to be checked. The data property ff:causesLossOfEarnings is on Event. So perhaps the triggering event (the MedicalAccompaniment) must have causesLossOfEarnings set to true.\n\n5. **Sie sind eine nahe angehörige Person oder Teil des engsten Umfelds.**\n   - The user is a close relative or part of the immediate circle of the accompanied person.\n   - The ontology has ff:closeRelative and ff:immediateCircleMember. So the user must be linked via either ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember to the person being accompanied. So, the user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember relationship pointing to the accompanied person.\n\n6. **Die zu begleitende Person bezieht Leistungen der Eingliederungshilfe. Sie erhalten kein Krankengeld von der Krankenkasse, wenn Sie den Menschen mit Behinderung zum Beispiel als persönliche Assistenz begleiten und dafür ein Entgelt erhalten. Begleiten Sie den Menschen mit Behinderung im Rahmen der Eingliederungshilfe, werden die Kosten von den Trägern der Eingliederungshilfe übernommen.**\n   - The accompanied person is receiving Integration Assistance (Eingliederungshilfe), which is a social benefit (ff:IntegrationAssistance). The user must not receive the benefit from the insurance if they are compensated, but in the case of Integration Assistance, costs are covered by the providers. \n   - So the accompanied person must be receiving IntegrationAssistance (ff:receivesBenefit linked to ff:IntegrationAssistance). Also, the user must not be receiving this benefit from the insurance (maybe via ff:isIneligibleFor? But the exact condition is a bit tricky. The key point is that the accompanied person is receiving IntegrationAssistance. The user's eligibility is dependent on that, so we need to ensure the accompanied person has that benefit.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape must target ff:User and enforce these constraints. Let me structure each constraint as a SHACL shape.\n\nFirst, define a shape for ff:User. The target is obviously the user node. Each condition becomes a constraint in the shape.\n\nStarting with condition 1: Both the user and the accompanied person must have statutory health insurance.\n\nFor the user's insurance: \n\nThe user has an ff:hasInsurance which is exactly ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance. So:\n\nsh:property [ \n  sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance \n] .\n\nFor the accompanied person's insurance: The user must have a relationship to the accompanied person, which we need to capture. Let's see, the ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold which links a CareNeed to a caregiver in the household. Maybe the CareNeed is part of the MedicalAccompaniment? Alternatively, the user's relationship to the accompanied person is via closeRelative or immediateCircleMember. But how to reference the accompanied person's insurance?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accompanied person is the one needing care, so there's a ff:needsCare (pointing to a CareNeed), and the caregiver is linked via ff:caregiverInHousehold. Wait, the CareNeed domain is ff:Person. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\nff:needsCare is an object property from Person to CareNeed.\n\nff:caregiverInHousehold is an object property from CareNeed to Person (the caregiver). \n\nSo, the user (as caregiver) is linked via the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold. The person needing care (the accompanied person) would be the person linked via needsCare to the CareNeed.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nSuppose the accompanied person (let's call them PersonX) needs care, so PersonX has a CareNeed (e.g., via ff:needsCare). The CareNeed then has a caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user (since the user is the caregiver). \n\nTherefore, the accompanied person is the one linked via the CareNeed to which the user is a caregiver.\n\nBut how to express in SHACL that the accompanied person (PersonX) has statutory health insurance?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accompanied person is connected through another property. Alternatively, perhaps the user's relationship to the accompanied person is via closeRelative or immediateCircleMember. However, the problem is that the SHACL must validate the user's data, so we need to ensure that the user's data includes these relationships and the properties of the other entities.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be linked to the accompanied person via either ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember. So, the user must have at least one of those relationships pointing to the accompanied person. So in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nBut we also need to ensure that the accompanied person has statutory health insurance. Since SHACL can't traverse through multiple hops easily, but perhaps using sh:property with path that goes through the relationship.\n\nWait, but SHACL allows for path expressions. For example, the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, and that person must have ff:hasInsurance ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance.\n\nSo the SHACL constraint for condition 1 (both have insurance) would be:\n\nFor the user's own insurance: as before.\n\nFor the accompanied person's insurance:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ?closeOrImmediate / ff:hasInsurance;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nBut how to define ?closeOrImmediate as either closeRelative or immediateCircleMember. Alternatively, using sh:alternativePath:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:closeRelative / ff:hasInsurance ) OR ( ff:immediateCircleMember / ff:hasInsurance );\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nBut SHACL's alternativePath is for paths, so maybe:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] / ff:hasInsurance;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nWait, the path would be the combination of either of those relationships followed by hasInsurance. So yes, that could work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a nested shape, but that might complicate things. Let me try to structure that.\n\nSo for condition 1, two parts: user's insurance and the accompanied person's insurance.\n\nNext, condition 2: The accompanied person is receiving inpatient treatment. \n\nThe MedicalAccompaniment is an Event (subclass of Event). The inPatientCoAdmission data property must be true.\n\nSo the user must be involved in an event that is a MedicalAccompaniment where inPatientCoAdmission is true. But how is the user linked to this event?\n\nLooking at the ontology, the MedicalAccompaniment is an event. The person being accompanied (PersonX) has a needsCare leading to a CareNeed, which is linked via caregiverInHousehold to the user. Alternatively, the MedicalAccompaniment might be the event that the user is participating in. Not sure. Alternatively, the user has an ff:hasEvent (since Person has ff:hasEvent). \n\nWait, looking at the ontology:\n\nff:hasEvent is an object property from Person or Employer to Event. So the user could have a MedicalAccompaniment event via ff:hasEvent.\n\nAlternatively, the MedicalAccompaniment is linked through the CareNeed. Maybe the CareNeed has a trigger or something else. Alternatively, the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the user is part of, so the user has an ff:hasEvent which is a MedicalAccompaniment with inPatientCoAdmission true.\n\nAssuming that the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the user is involved in, then:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n  sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nThen, within that MedicalAccompaniment, the inPatientCoAdmission must be true. So using a nested shape:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ];\n    sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment;\n  ];\n].\n\nThat would ensure that the user has at least one MedicalAccompaniment event with inPatientCoAdmission true.\n\nCondition 3: The accompaniment must be medically necessary (which is implied by the event being required?), and the fullDayAccompaniment is true (>=8 hours including travel).\n\nThe fullDayAccompaniment is a data property on MedicalAccompaniment, so that's covered by the above, but we need to set that to true.\n\nWait, in the MedicalAccompaniment event's data property, fullDayAccompaniment must be true.\n\nSo in the qualifiedValueShape for the MedicalAccompaniment:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment;\n  sh:hasValue true;\n].\n\nSo combining conditions 2 and 3, the MedicalAccompaniment event must have both inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment as true.\n\nSo the qualifiedValueShape would have both properties.\n\nCondition4: The user has a loss of earnings. The event (MedicalAccompaniment?) must have causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nAssuming the MedicalAccompaniment is the event that causes the loss, then:\n\nIn the same MedicalAccompaniment event, we need to have causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nWait, causesLossOfEarnings is a data property on ff:Event, so the MedicalAccompaniment (as an Event) must have that set to true.\n\nSo adding another property to the qualifiedValueShape:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n  sh:hasValue true;\n].\n\nSo putting it all together for the MedicalAccompaniment constraints:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ];\n    sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment;\n  ];\n].\n\nCondition5: The user is a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember of the accompanied person. This was covered earlier with the path.\n\nCondition6: The accompanied person receives Integration Assistance. \n\nThe accompanied person (PersonX) must have ff:receivesBenefit linked to ff:IntegrationAssistance. Again, to express that in SHACL from the user's perspective:\n\nWe need to ensure that the person linked via closeRelative or immediateCircleMember has ff:receivesBenefit with value ff:IntegrationAssistance.\n\nSo similar to the insurance condition, but for the receivesBenefit property:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] / ff:receivesBenefit;\n  sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nThis ensures that at least one of the closeRelative or immediateCircleMember has that benefit.\n\nPutting all these together, the SHACL shape will have multiple sh:property constraints.\n\nNow, I need to structure the Turtle code properly, using the ff prefixes and ensuring all constraints are correctly placed.\n\nWait, but also, the user must not be receiving the benefit from the insurance if they are compensated, but the condition says that if they are part of Integration Assistance, the costs are covered by the assistance. The user's eligibility is dependent on the accompanied person receiving Integration Assistance, so the above covers that.\n\nAre there any other conditions? Let me double-check:\n\nThe user must not have other priority claims, but the description says \"Sie haben keinen Prioritätsanspruch\". Wait, looking back at the text:\n\nOriginal condition 6 mentions that the user doesn't get the benefit from the insurance if they are paid, but the main requirement is that the accompanied person is on Integration Assistance. So maybe the SHACL constraint only needs to check that the accompanied person is receiving IntegrationAssistance, as per the last part.\n\nAnother point: The user must be accompanying a person with a disability. The accompanied person must have a disability. \n\nWait, the first condition says \"Person mit Behinderung\" (person with disability). So the accompanied person must have a disability. The ontology has ff:hasDisability as a data property. So the accompanied person must have ff:hasDisability true.\n\nTherefore, we need another constraint: the closeRelative or immediateCircleMember must have ff:hasDisability true.\n\nAdding that:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] / ff:hasDisability;\n  sh:hasValue true;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nWait, but ff:hasDisability is a boolean data property on Person. So yes.\n\nSo that's another condition to add.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape for ff:User will have the following properties:\n\n1. User has statutory health insurance.\n2. Accompanied person (via closeRelative/immediateCircle) has statutory health insurance.\n3. User is linked to a MedicalAccompaniment event with inPatientCoAdmission true, fullDayAccompaniment true, and causesLossOfEarnings true.\n4. User is linked via closeRelative or immediateCircle to the accompanied person.\n5. Accompanied person has disability (ff:hasDisability true).\n6. Accompanied person receives IntegrationAssistance.\n\nNow, structuring this in Turtle.\n\nFirst, define the shape for ff:User. The target is the User node.\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\n:ShapeKrankengeld\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] / ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] / ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] / ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n.\n\nWait, but the 'sh:alternativePath' in the paths. In Turtle, the alternativePath is written as a list with sh:alternativePath. So perhaps:\n\nFor the insurance of the accompanied person:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [\n    sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ;\n  ] / ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n].\n\nBut I need to make sure the path is correctly written. Alternatively, using a nested node:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ?closeOrImmediate / ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n] ;\nsh:node [\n  sh:declare ?closeOrImmediate ;\n  sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ;\n] .\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, the path can be written as a sequence with alternativePath.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to split the constraints into separate properties for each condition to avoid confusion.\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the alternativePath can be used in the path expression. Let me check the SHACL syntax for alternativePath.\n\nThe alternativePath is a path that represents a logical OR between the listed paths. So in the path expression, the following is valid:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:closeRelative / ff:hasInsurance ) || ( ff:immediateCircleMember / ff:hasInsurance );\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nBut in Turtle, the alternative is written with sh:alternativePath inside a path expression node. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [\n    a sh:Path ;\n    sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ;\n  ] / ff:hasInsurance ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n].\n\nThis way, the path is first taking either closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, then following hasInsurance.\n\nSimilarly for the other properties (hasDisability and receivesBenefit).\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe complete SHACL would be as follows, ensuring all constraints are covered.\n\nAlso, note that the target is ff:User, so the shape's target is correct.\n\nAnother point: The user must be the caregiver in the MedicalAccompaniment? The MedicalAccompaniment is linked via ff:hasEvent, so that's okay.\n\nTesting all conditions:\n\n- User has insurance: covered.\n- Accompanied person has insurance: covered via the path.\n- Accompanied has disability: yes.\n- Accompanied receives IntegrationAssistance: yes.\n- MedicalAccompaniment event with the required properties: yes.\n- User is closeRelative or immediateCircle: yes via the path (the first property with the alternativePath ensures that there's at least one such relationship).\n\nThis should cover all conditions. I think this is the correct approach. Now, time to write the Turtle code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:ShapeKrankengeld\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n  # Condition 1: Both user and accompanied have statutory health insurance\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [\n      sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ;\n    ] / ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 5: User is closeRelative or immediateCircle of accompanied person\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 2+3: Accompanied has disability\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [\n      sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ;\n    ] / ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 6: Accompanied receives Integration Assistance\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [\n      sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative ff:immediateCircleMember ) ;\n    ] / ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance ;\n  ] ;\n\n  # Condition 2-4: Medical Accompaniment requirements\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n.\n```"

The applicant must have lived in a legally valid marriage or registered partnership before the event.\n\nIneligibility Conditions:\n- If the marriage/partnership was entered into after the insured event AND the death occurred within the first year of that marriage/partnership.\n\nNow, I need to translate these into SHACL constraints targeting the node ff:User.\n\nStarting with the eligibility:\n\nFor the first condition (death due to insured event):\n- The user's spouse must have a causeOfDeath linked to an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. So, the user must be connected via deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner to the deceased, who in turn has a causeOfDeath of one of those event types.\n\nWait, but in SHACL, how do I model this? The user (ff:User) must have a deceased spouse (ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner), and the causeOfDeath of that deceased person must be an instance of one of the three event classes. \n\nSo the shape for ff:User should have a property path that navigates to the deceased's causeOfDeath. The property paths would be something like ff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath. But need to check the ontology for the properties.\n\nLooking at ontology:\n\n- ff:deceasedSpouse has domain ff:Person (so user can have this), range ff:Person (the deceased). Similarly for ff:deceasedCivilPartner.\n\nThe causeOfDeath is an ObjectProperty from Person to Event. So the deceased person (the spouse) must have a causeOfDeath which is a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nSo in SHACL, for the first condition:\n\n- The user must have a deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner (so at least one of these).\n- The causeOfDeath of that deceased person must be an instance of one of the three event classes.\n\nSo, the SHACL shape for the user would have a constraint that the path (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner)/ff:causeOfDeath must be a member of the union of those three classes.\n\nAdditionally, the deceased's causeOfDeath must be one of those three types. So a sh:class constraint on that path with the three classes as allowed.\n\nSecond part: the applicant must have lived in a legally valid marriage or partnership before the event.\n\nThe event here is the causeOfDeath (the accident or disease). So the marriage or partnership must have existed before the event's occurrence.\n\nIn the ontology, the legalUnionBeforeEvent is an ObjectProperty from Event to Person (the partner). Wait, the definition says: \"Links an event (e.g., insurance event), experienced by person A, to another person B with whom they were married or in a civil union before and during the event.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the event (e.g., the work accident) must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the partner. But how does that relate to the user?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have been in a valid marriage/partnership before the event. The event (causeOfDeath) must have occurred while they were in such a union.\n\nAlternatively, the user's marital status prior to the event must have included the deceased as a spouse/partner.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The condition states that the applicant must have lived in a legally valid marriage or partnership before the event. So the user and the deceased must have been in such a union before the event occurred.\n\nPerhaps the event (the causeOfDeath) must have the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user (since the deceased is the one who had the event leading to death). Wait, maybe the event is the causeOfDeath of the deceased, so the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent should point to the user.\n\nAlternatively, the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent must exist and refer to the user, indicating that prior to the event, the deceased was in a marriage/partnership with the user.\n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\nlegalUnionBeforeEvent is a property from Event to Person. So the event (causeOfDeath) must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent link to the user.\n\nTherefore, for the second eligibility condition:\n\nThe event (causeOfDeath of the deceased) must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nThe path would be (ff:deceasedSpouse/ff:causeOfDeath) or (ff:deceasedCivilPartner/ff:causeOfDeath), and then on that event, there must be a legalUnionBeforeEvent that is the user.\n\nWait, the user is the one applying, so the legalUnionBeforeEvent of the event (causeOfDeath) should be the user.\n\nTherefore, the event (ff:causeOfDeath of the deceased) must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent = ff:User.\n\nNow for the ineligibility conditions:\n\nNo claim if:\n\n- The marriage/partnership was entered into after the insured event AND the death occurred within the first year of that marriage/partnership.\n\nSo, the user must NOT have a situation where:\n\n1. The marriage/partnership (with the deceased) was after the event (i.e., the event happened before the marriage/partnership started).\n\nAND\n\n2. The death occurred within the first year of the marriage/partnership.\n\nTherefore, in SHACL, we need to model that either the marriage/partnership was before the event, or the death wasn't within the first year, etc. But since SHACL can't express negative constraints easily, perhaps better to model the ineligibility as a violation if both conditions are true, so the shape must exclude such cases.\n\nBut SHACL's negative constraints are tricky. Since SHACL is for validation (i.e., data must conform to the rules), the ineligibility would mean that if the data meets those ineligibility conditions, then the user is invalid (ineligible). So the shape should have a constraint that if the ineligibility conditions are met, then it's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, to model the eligibility, perhaps it's better to structure the constraints to require that either the marriage/partnership was before the event, or if it's after, then the death wasn't within the first year.\n\nWait, the ineligibility is when both are true: marriage after event AND death within first year.\n\nSo to be eligible, the user must NOT have (marriage after event AND death within first year). Which can be rephrased as either the marriage was before the event, OR the death wasn't within the first year of the marriage.\n\nTherefore, in SHACL, we need to ensure that for the user's relationship with the deceased (spouse or civil partner), either:\n\n- The marriage/partnership was before the event (causeOfDeath's date), OR\n\n- The death occurred more than one year after the marriage/partnership started.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nFirst, the event's date (the causeOfDeath's hasDate) must be before the start of the marriage/partnership? Wait no. The ineligibility is when the marriage was after the event. So the event (causeOfDeath's date) must have happened before the marriage/partnership's start.\n\nAlternatively, the marriage/partnership was formed after the event (i.e., the event date is before the marriage start date).\n\nSo, the ineligibility is when:\n\n(event date < marriage start date) AND (death date - marriage start date < 1 year)\n\nBut death is the event itself (the causeOfDeath), so the death date is the event's hasDate.\n\nWait, the marriage/partnership is the legal union between the user and the deceased. So the marriage start date is when they entered into the marriage/partnership.\n\nThe event (the causeOfDeath) must have occurred before the marriage start date. Then the death (the event) is part of that event, so the death date is the event's date. Then the death date (event's date) is before the marriage start date? That can't be, since the marriage would have to exist before the event.\n\nWait, the ineligibility is when the marriage was entered after the event. So the event (the cause of death) occurred before the marriage. Then the death occurred before the marriage started. That would mean the marriage was after the death, which can't be because the death is of the spouse.\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake. The ineligibility condition is when the couple entered the marriage/partnership after the event (i.e., the event happened before the marriage/partnership was formed), AND the death occurred within the first year of the marriage. Wait, that would mean the death happened after the marriage started but within a year, but the marriage was formed after the event (which caused death). That's a contradiction because the event (the cause of death) must have occurred before the marriage for the ineligibility condition to apply. So the death would be part of the event before the marriage, but the death can't happen after the marriage starts if the marriage was after the event.\n\nHmm, perhaps the ineligibility is when the marriage was formed after the event (i.e., the spouse/partner died due to the event before the marriage), and then they got married, and the death occurred within the first year of the marriage. That doesn't make sense because the death already happened before the marriage. Maybe the wording is that the death occurred within the first year of the marriage/partnership.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ineligibility is when the marriage was formed after the event (so the event was before marriage), and the death (the event's date) is within the first year of the marriage. But that would require the death to be after the marriage starts, which conflicts with the event being before the marriage.\n\nWait, perhaps the ineligibility is when they got married after the event (e.g., the spouse had an accident, then later married the applicant, and died within a year of that marriage). That scenario would trigger ineligibility.\n\nIn that case, the event (the causeOfDeath) is the accident, which happened before the marriage. The death (the event's date) is after the marriage? No, that can't be because the death is the event's date. Wait, the event is the cause of death, so the event's date is when the death happened. So if the marriage was formed after the event (i.e., after the death), then the death date is before the marriage start, so the death can't be within the first year of the marriage because the marriage didn't exist then.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition. The text says:\n\n\"Sie haben in der Regel keinen Anspruch, wenn\n\n  * Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben und\n  * der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist.\"\n\nTranslated: You have no claim if:\n\n- You entered into the marriage/partnership after the insured event (Versicherungsfall) and\n\n- the death occurred within the first year of that marriage/partnership.\n\nSo the event (Versicherungsfall, which caused the death) happened before the marriage/partnership. Then, the marriage/partnership is formed after the event. The death (the event's date) is the same as the event's date, so the death occurred before the marriage. But the second condition requires the death to be within the first year of the marriage. That's impossible because the death was before the marriage. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event (Versicherungsfall) is something that led to the death, but the death occurred after the marriage was formed. So the event could be, say, an occupational disease, and the spouse was diagnosed with it (event) before the marriage, but then married the applicant and later died due to that disease (death within the marriage's first year). That would fit the ineligibility conditions.\n\nIn this case, the Versicherungsfall (the event causing the death) happened before the marriage, but the death (the event's date) is after the marriage starts but within the first year.\n\nTherefore, the two conditions are:\n\n1. The marriage/partnership was formed after the Versicherungsfall (event).\n\n2. The death (event's date) occurred within the first year of the marriage.\n\nSo to model this in SHACL, we need to check that the user does NOT have both of these conditions true.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, the marriage start date must be after the event's date (Versicherungsfall's date).\n\nSecond, the death date (the event's date) must be within the first year of the marriage (so death date is >= marriage start date, and death date - marriage start date < 1 year).\n\nTherefore, to be eligible, the user must NOT have both these conditions.\n\nBut in SHACL, expressing such a negation is challenging because SHACL is for conformance, not exclusion. So perhaps it's better to structure the constraints to require that either the marriage was before the event, OR the death was not within the first year.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the ineligibility as a constraint that if the marriage is after the event AND the death is within the first year, then it's invalid. But since SHACL can't directly model such a negative, perhaps using sh:qualifiedMinCount or other constructs.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:disjoint with a shape that triggers when both conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, create a shape that enforces that either the marriage is before the event, or the death is not within the first year.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the marriage/partnership start date: how is that represented in the ontology?\n\nThe ontology doesn't have a direct property for marriage start date. The user has a marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) which points to an instance of MaritalStatus (e.g., Married). But to track when the marriage started, perhaps the Event that is the marriage? Or perhaps the marital status instance has a start date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the legalUnionBeforeEvent property can help here. Wait, the legalUnionBeforeEvent is on the event (the Versicherungsfall) pointing to the user, indicating that the user was in a union with the deceased before the event.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's marital status history isn't modeled in the ontology in a way that can track when the marriage started. This might be a problem because the ineligibility condition requires knowing the marriage start date.\n\nLooking back at the ontology, I don't see any properties that track the start date of a marriage or partnership. The ontology's properties related to marriage are:\n\n- ff:hasMaritalStatus links to an instance of MaritalStatus (like Married, Widowed, etc.), but it doesn't indicate when that status started.\n\nWithout a property to track the start date of the marriage, modeling the ineligibility condition's second part (death within first year) is impossible. Therefore, according to the ontology provided, this condition might be ambiguous or not modelable, hence we should exclude it as per the strict rules.\n\nThe problem says to not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed because of ambiguity or third-party discretion. Since the ontology lacks the necessary properties (like marriage start date), this part might not be modelable. Therefore, perhaps the ineligibility condition can't be fully captured, so we should only model the eligibility conditions.\n\nWait, the user instruction says to \"model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties\" — no, the instruction says to \"do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\" So we must exclude any condition that can't be modeled with the given ontology.\n\nGiven that the ontology doesn't have a way to track when the marriage started (since ff:hasMaritalStatus just points to the marital status instance, which doesn't have a start date), the second part of the ineligibility condition (death within the first year of the marriage) cannot be modeled. The first part (marriage after the event) also can't be modeled because we don't have the marriage start date.\n\nTherefore, the ineligibility conditions might not be modelable with the given ontology. The problem states to exclude such requirements. Therefore, the ineligibility conditions may be omitted.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the eligibility conditions only.\n\nNow proceeding to write the SHACL.\n\nThe target is ff:User. The shape will have constraints on the user's properties.\n\nFirst, the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner (ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner). So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path (ff:deceasedSpouse || ff:deceasedCivilPartner);\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nSecond, that deceased's causeOfDeath must be one of the three event types (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease).\n\nSo the path would be (ff:deceasedSpouse/ff:causeOfDeath || ff:deceasedCivilPartner/ff:causeOfDeath). Since it's OR between spouse and civil partner, we can model each path separately.\n\nWait, using SHACL's path expressions, perhaps:\n\nsh:path ( [ sh:alternativePath (ff:deceasedSpouse) ] / ff:causeOfDeath,\n           [ sh:alternativePath (ff:deceasedCivilPartner) ] / ff:causeOfDeath )\n\nAlternatively, using the union of paths.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:or to combine the two paths.\n\nAlternatively, the path can be expressed as (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner)/ff:causeOfDeath.\n\nThen, for each such path, the value must be a member of the allowed classes.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner) / ff:causeOfDeath );\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nWait, but the path must evaluate to exactly one of the three classes. Since the user must have at least one deceased partner with such a causeOfDeath, the minCount 1 is needed.\n\nThird condition: the legalUnionBeforeEvent of the causeOfDeath (event) must be the user.\n\nWait, the event (causeOfDeath) must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nSo the path is (ff:deceasedSpouse/ff:causeOfDeath/ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent) must equal the user (ff:User).\n\nBut the user is the one being validated. So, the path for the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent should be the user.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner)/ff:causeOfDeath/ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent );\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n]\n\nBut since the user is the target, in SHACL, the path must evaluate to the user's IRI. Since the target is ff:User, the value of legalUnionBeforeEvent must be the user.\n\nTherefore, this constraint ensures that the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent is indeed the user.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape will have three constraints:\n\n1. Must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\n\n2. The causeOfDeath of that partner must be one of the three event types.\n\n3. The event's legalUnionBeforeEvent must be the user.\n\nAdditionally, each of these must be true, so all properties are required.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would be:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:BenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:deceasedSpouse || ff:deceasedCivilPartner) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner) / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner)/ff:causeOfDeath/ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ) ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but SHACL syntax for paths with alternatives: the | operator is used in the path to denote alternatives. The first property's path is (ff:deceasedSpouse || ff:deceasedCivilPartner) — but in SHACL, the OR for paths is using the | operator. Wait, actually, SHACL's path can use | to denote alternative paths. So the first path is (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner), which is the union of the two properties. Then, the user must have at least one of those.\n\nThe first property's path is (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner), and the minCount 1 ensures that at least one exists.\n\nThe second property's path is the same as above, then followed by /ff:causeOfDeath. So the path is ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner) / ff:causeOfDeath ), and the class must be one of the three.\n\nThe third path is the same path as above, followed by /ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent, which must have the value of the user.\n\nWait, but the third property's path is ( (deceasedSpouse | deceasedCivilPartner)/causeOfDeath/legalUnionBeforeEvent ). The legalUnionBeforeEvent must point to the user.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in SHACL, the path syntax allows combining with | and /.\n\nAnother thing: the legalUnionBeforeEvent is an object property from Event to Person. So the path (deceasedSpouse/causeOfDeath) gives us the Event (the causeOfDeath), then legalUnionBeforeEvent of that event is the user.\n\nThis should correctly model the third condition.\n\nNow, checking for any other constraints:\n\nThe first eligibility condition says the death must be due to an insured event (the three types). That's covered by the second property.\n\nThe second eligibility condition is that the user and the deceased were in a valid marriage/partnership before the event. The legalUnionBeforeEvent on the event must point to the user, which is the third property.\n\nSo this should cover the eligibility conditions.\n\nAs for the ineligibility conditions, since they can't be modeled (due to missing ontology properties like marriage start date), they are omitted as per the problem's instructions.\n\nThus, the final SHACL is as above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:BenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Must have a deceased spouse/civil partner\n        sh:path (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: Cause of death must be a valid insured event\n        sh:path ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner) / ff:causeOfDeath ) ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 3: Legal union existed before the event\n        sh:path ( (ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner)/ff:causeOfDeath/ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ) ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] .\n```"
