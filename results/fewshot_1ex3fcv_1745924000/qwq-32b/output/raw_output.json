The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Einstiegsgeld' with the IDLB B100019_LB_102713860 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text provided.\n\nFirst, the main conditions listed are:\n\n1. The user must have been receiving \"Bürgergeld\" (Citizen benefit) before starting the new activity. Unemployment isn't a requirement here.\n2. The application must be submitted to the Jobcenter before starting the new employment.\n3. The new self-employment or employment must be suitable to help overcome their need for assistance in the long term.\n4. The 'Einstiegsgeld' is necessary for integration into the general labor market.\n5. The employment must involve at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditionally, for self-employment or starting a business, there are extra requirements:\n- Positive evaluation by the Jobcenter regarding personal suitability and the economic viability of the self-employment.\n\nNow, looking at the ontology provided, I need to map these conditions to the available classes, properties, and individuals.\n\nStarting with the first condition: receiving Bürgergeld before the new activity. The Bürgergeld is represented by the individual ff:B100019_LB_106311931. The user must have this benefit. The property to use here would be ff:receivesBenefit. However, the condition specifies that they received it before starting the new activity. But since SHACL is about current data, maybe it's checking if they currently receive it? Wait, the text says \"vor Aufnahme der neuen Tätigkeit\" which means before starting the new activity. Since the SHACL is validating current data, perhaps it's sufficient that they are currently receiving it, assuming the application is before starting. Alternatively, maybe there's a property like receivedWithinLast3Years? But the ontology has ff:receivedBenefit which links to a past benefit. Hmm. Wait, the ontology has ff:receivesBenefit for current benefits and ff:receivedBenefit for past. Since the user needs to have been receiving it before starting the new job, maybe the current receivesBenefit would include that, but I need to ensure that they still do. Or perhaps the application is made before starting, so they might still be receiving it. So the SHACL constraint would require that the user has ff:receivesBenefit with ff:B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nSecond condition: application submitted before starting the activity. But how to model that in SHACL? Since it's about the timing of the application relative to starting work, but SHACL can't handle temporal data unless there's a property that captures the application date. The ontology doesn't have such a property. The user's data might include an application date via some property, but the ontology doesn't mention it. Since the ontology doesn't have that, this condition might be ambiguous and thus we can't model it. The problem states not to model ambiguous requirements. So maybe skip this condition as it can't be assessed with the given ontology.\n\nThird condition: the new activity must be suitable to overcome help need. The ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause pointing to a disability, but not sure. Maybe this is about the purpose of the training or employment. Since the ontology includes ff:participates for training, but the condition is about the activity's suitability. Perhaps the training needs to be commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency being true). The ontology has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency as a data property on Training. So if the user is participating in a training commissioned by the employment agency, that might satisfy the suitability. But the condition is about employment or self-employment, not necessarily training. Hmm, maybe this is not directly mappable. Alternatively, maybe the user must be in an employment with certain properties. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus which could be relevant, but not sure. Since the exact property isn't clear, maybe this condition is too vague and can't be modeled. Wait, the example included a constraint on receiving a benefit. Maybe the main condition is that the user must have the new employment, which has a workHoursPerWeek of at least 15.\n\nFourth condition: Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration. This seems similar to the third point and might be covered by the same constraints.\n\nFifth condition: employment must be at least 15 hours per week. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. So the user's Employment must have workHoursPerWeek ≥ 15.\n\nFor the additional conditions for self-employment:\n\n- Positive evaluation by Jobcenter regarding personal suitability and economic viability. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus, but not sure. The evaluation might be part of a property like ff:triggeringEvent or something else. Alternatively, there might be a data property indicating approval. Since the ontology doesn't have a property for this evaluation, this might also be ambiguous. So perhaps those conditions can't be modeled and should be excluded.\n\nNow, putting together the constraints:\n\n- The user must have receivesBenefit with ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n- The user must have an Employment (or SelfEmployed status?) with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Since the condition mentions \"Erwerbstätigkeit\" which can be employment or self-employment, but the ontology's ff:Employment is for employment, maybe the user has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Alternatively, if self-employment is considered, maybe the employment status is SelfEmployed (ff:SelfEmployed), but the hours would still need to be checked. However, the ontology's ff:workHoursPerWeek is on Employment, not on SelfEmployed. So perhaps the constraint is on ff:Employment's workHoursPerWeek.\n\nWait, the fifth condition says \"Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche\" – their employment activity must include at least 15 hours per week. So the user must have an Employment (or equivalent) with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. So the shape should require that the user has an Employment linked via ff:hasEmployment, and that Employment has workHoursPerWeek ≥15.\n\nAlso, the user must be in an employment status that allows this. Maybe the employment status is JobSeeker or something else, but not sure. Since the first condition allows receiving Bürgergeld without unemployment, maybe the user can be in any employment status except employed? Not sure, but the main point is the hours.\n\nAdditionally, the application must be submitted before starting the activity. Since that's temporal and not covered in the ontology, skip it.\n\nNow, for the SHACL shapes:\n\nTarget node is ff:User. The shape will check:\n\n1. ff:receivesBenefit must include ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n\nBut SHACL requires that the user has at least one such value. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, but maybe the user could have multiple benefits, so the shape needs to ensure that at least one of them is Bürgergeld. Alternatively, that the Bürgergeld is among the benefits they receive. So the hasValue is correct.\n\nSecond constraint: the user has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ff:Employment;  # Maybe redundant but ensures it's Employment type\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n    ];\n]\n\nWait, but the user must have an Employment (maybe via hasEmployment) that has workHoursPerWeek >=15. So the path is ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek. But in SHACL, to express that for each Employment linked via hasEmployment, the workHoursPerWeek is >=15, but the condition requires that at least one Employment exists with that. Wait, actually the user must have at least one Employment where workHoursPerWeek is ≥15. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n            sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n        ];\n    ];\n]\n\nAlternatively, the path is ff:hasEmployment, and then within that, the workHoursPerWeek must be at least 15. So using qualified constraints.\n\nPutting this together.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the user must be in a certain employment status. The condition says \"Arbeitslosigkeit ist keine Voraussetzung\", so unemployment isn't required. So the user might be registered unemployed but that's not required. So perhaps no constraint on employment status, except the hours.\n\nAlso, the 'Einstiegsgeld' is the benefit we're validating eligibility for, so the shape should be linked to that benefit's ID.\n\nThe example provided in the problem includes a shape for the benefit and a node shape for the User. Following the example's structure:\n\nThe SHACL would have a node shape for the benefit, then a shape targeting ff:User with the constraints.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, declare the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:EinstiegsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Bürgergeld constraint\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n        sh:message \"User does not receive Bürgergeld\"@en;\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        # Employment with >=15 hours\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n                sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n                sh:message \"Employment does not meet minimum 15 hours/week\"@en;\n            ];\n        ];\n    ];\n    # Maybe other constraints?\n    # The part about the Jobcenter evaluation is not possible\n    # The necessity for integration might be covered by the employment's purpose, but not modeled\n    # The 'positive evaluation' can't be modeled without a property\n    # So those are omitted\n.\n\nWait, but the first condition says they must have been receiving Bürgergeld before starting the new activity. Since SHACL is about current data, maybe they still are receiving it when applying. So the constraint is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the new activity is either self-employment or employment. The ontology has ff:SelfEmployed as an employment status. So maybe the user's employment status must be SelfEmployed or something else? The condition says \"Selbstständigkeit oder neue Beschäftigung\", so either self-employment or new employment. The employment status would be SelfEmployed or perhaps Employee? But the exact status isn't specified, so perhaps the employment type isn't necessary as long as the work hours are met.\n\nSo the current constraints should be sufficient. The other conditions that can't be modeled are omitted as per the problem's rules.\n\nThus, the final SHACL would include these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main validation shape for the User node\nff:EinstiegsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must currently receive Bürgergeld\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives Bürgergeld.'\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Employment must have at least 15 hours/week\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                sh:message \"Employment does not meet minimum 15 hours/week requirement.\"@en ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102799525 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe first condition is that the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance. Looking at the ontology, survivors' benefits might relate to being a deceased spouse or civil partner. The property ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner could be relevant here. Also, the insurance involved is probably ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. Maybe the user needs to have an insurance of that type?\n\nThe second condition is that the user has remarried or entered a new civil partnership after widowhood. The ontology has ff:MaritalStatus with subclasses like Married and CivilUnion. The property newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property of ff:MaritalStatus, which is a boolean. So the user's marital status should have newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nNow, translating these into SHACL constraints. The target node is ff:User. \n\nFirst constraint: The user must have a claim on survivors' benefits. Since the exact individual for survivors' benefit isn't listed, perhaps the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner. Alternatively, maybe the user must have an insurance linked to such a claim. Alternatively, the requirement might be that the user is a beneficiary via ff:deceasedSpouse or similar. Let's see the ontology properties. The ff:hasInsurance property links a person to an insurance they have. But the benefit in question is a survivors' benefit, which might require being a dependent of a deceased insured person. Since the ontology includes ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner, perhaps the user must have either a deceased spouse or civil partner. So, the user must have at least one of these relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an insurance that provides survivors' benefits. But the ontology's ff:hasInsurance might not directly indicate that. Alternatively, the user's deceased relative must have had the insurance. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The exact ontology terms need to be checked. The Survivors' benefits (Hinterbliebenenleistung) typically require that the deceased was insured. Since the user is the beneficiary, they must be a surviving spouse or civil partner. So the user must have either a deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSecond condition: The user has remarried or new civil partnership after widowhood. The marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood flag set to true. So the user's marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must link to a marital status instance where the newUnionAfterWidowhood is true.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have two properties:\n\n1. The user must have at least one deceased spouse or civil partner. So either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner must exist. Since SHACL can have OR conditions using sh:or, we can check for existence of either property.\n\n2. The marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. So the marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must point to an object where the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood is true.\n\nAdditionally, the target node is ff:User, so the shape targets that.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nFirst, create a shape for the benefit, targetting ff:User. \n\nFirst constraint: Either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner must exist. Using sh:or with two path constraints.\n\nSecond constraint: The marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but how to express that the linked marital status has that property. So, the inner property is the data property of the object of hasMaritalStatus.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:hasValue with a node shape for the marital status. Hmm, maybe better to use a nested shape.\n\nAlternatively, the path can be a property path: ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood and then check that it's true.\n\nYes, that's possible. So the path is:\n\nsh:path [ sh:propertyPath ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:propertyPath ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ]\n\nThen sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:MaritalStatus ;  // Ensure it's a marital status instance\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nBut maybe the simpler way is to use a path with the two properties.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would look like:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Either deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner exists\n        sh:path [ sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or new partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first constraint uses sh:or on the path, which allows checking if either of the properties has at least one value. That should work. The sh:or is applied to the path, so the path is either of those properties, and the minCount 1 requires that at least one of them has a value.\n\nThe second property path is ff:hasMaritalStatus followed by ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood. The sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean would require that this property is true.\n\nI should also make sure that the marital status is present. But since the path requires the newUnionAfterWidowhood, if hasMaritalStatus is missing, then the path would not have a value, but the sh:minInclusive would require it to be true. Wait, that might not work. Because if the path doesn't exist, then the value is not present, which would not satisfy the boolean condition. So perhaps the user must have a marital status, and that marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood as true. Therefore, the path should check that the property exists and is true.\n\nAlternatively, the path's value must be exactly true. So, using sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean. That would require that the path's value is exactly true. But if the path is not present, then it's invalid. So combining with sh:minCount 1 on the path. \n\nWait, maybe better to structure the second constraint as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # Or sh:hasValue \"true\"\n    ]\n]\n\nBut in SHACL, the nested property can be done with the path being a property path. Alternatively, the above approach with path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood and sh:hasValue true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nThis would require that the path exists and has value true. So if the user has no marital status, then this would fail, which is correct because they must have a marital status that fulfills that condition.\n\nTherefore, the second property can be written as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:message \"User must have a marital status indicating new union after widowhood.\"@en ;\n]\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe shape will have two properties: one for the deceased spouse/civil partner, and the other for the marital status's newUnionAfterWidowhood being true.\n\nAdditionally, the benefit's individual should be defined as a SocialBenefit with the given ID and labels, but the example shows that the shape name is based on the benefit's label. Following the example, the shape is named after the benefit's label, so perhaps:\n\nThe benefit's individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance retirement settlement\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner for survivors' claim.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or formed new civil partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in the example, the shape's name was the same as the label's German part, like \"Einstiegsgeld\". Here, the German label is \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\", so maybe the shape name is \"GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung\" without spaces.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final SHACL should include the individual definition and the node shape with those two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit individual\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance retirement settlement\"@en .\n\n# SHACL shape for eligibility validation\nff:GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have a deceased spouse or civil partner\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ \n            sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) \n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner for survivors' claim.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Must have remarried/new partnership after widowhood\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or formed new civil partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_582422. Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nThe first condition is that there must be an accident at work or on the way to work, or an recognized occupational disease. Looking at the ontology, the relevant classes for these are WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, and OccupationalDisease, all of which are subclasses of Event. \n\nThe second condition is that the person is participating in a qualified measure for participation in working life, specifically occupational rehabilitation. The ontology has the class OccupationalRehabilitation, so the user must have a participation in that. The property to link a person to a training or program is participates, so the path would be ff:participates with the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nNow, translating this into SHACL shapes. The main shape targets ff:User. The first condition requires that the user has an event of one of the mentioned types. So a property shape on ff:hasEvent must check the class is one of those three. Since SHACL allows using sh:class with multiple options, I can list them in sh:class.\n\nThe second condition is straightforward: the user must have a participation in an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. So another property shape on ff:participates with sh:class set to ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nI need to ensure the SHACL syntax is correct. The shapes should be node shapes with targetNode as ff:User. Each condition is a separate property constraint. Also, the messages should be in English as per the example.\n\nWait, the first condition's events (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease) are all subclasses of Event, so in SHACL, the sh:class can include those three. Let me confirm their URIs from the ontology:\n\n- WorkAccident is ff:WorkAccident\n- CommutingAccident is ff:CommutingAccident\n- OccupationalDisease is ff:OccupationalDisease\n\nYes. So the first property shape's sh:class should be (ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease).\n\nThe second condition uses participates to an OccupationalRehabilitation. The property path is ff:participates and the class is ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. Also, since participation is required, sh:minCount 1 is needed.\n\nI should structure the main shape with two properties: one for the event and one for participation. Each with their respective constraints. Also, the social benefit individual must be defined with its ID and labels.\n\nLet me check the example provided. In the example, they used sh:or for multiple shapes, but here the conditions are separate, so no need for or. Just two separate property constraints.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL would look like this:\n\nDefine the SocialBenefit individual first. Then create a NodeShape for the benefit, targetting ff:User. The first property checks that the user has an event of the correct type. The second checks participation in occupational rehab.\n\nLet me also include appropriate messages for each condition, similar to the example.\n\nI need to make sure all prefixes are correctly used, and that the Turtle syntax is valid. Also, use the correct property paths. For the first condition, the path is ff:hasEvent, and the class check. For the second, the path is ff:participates with the class.\n\nYes, that should cover the requirements without adding any extra constraints. Let me write this out properly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Transitional Allowance for Occupational Rehabilitation\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:UnfallRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582422 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: User has relevant accident or occupational disease\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has work accident/commuting accident/recognized occupational disease'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 2: Participates in occupational rehabilitation\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Participating in occupational rehabilitation'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and wrap it in triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Kinderzuschlag' benefit based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one child who meets certain criteria. The child must be under 25, not married or in a civil partnership, and living in the same household. Also, the child shouldn't have priority claims over the benefit. The user must receive child benefit for the child, which is either Kindergeld or an equivalent from abroad.\n\nNext, the income conditions: as a couple, the family gross income must be at least €900/month, or as a single parent, personal gross income at least €600/month. The income after reductions shouldn't bring the child supplement to zero. They must not have considerable assets. The combined income plus other benefits must cover the family's needs under SGB II. The benefit is subordinate to other income sources for the child, so the user must pursue those first.\n\nNow, mapping this to SHACL shapes. The target is ff:User. Let's look at the ontology. The user must have a child via ff:receivesChildBenefitFor. The child's age is checked via ff:hasAge <25. Marital status should exclude Married and CivilUnion. SameHouseholdAs should link to User. Also, the child must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the Kinderzuschlag.\n\nFor income, if the user is a single parent (ff:isSingleParent true), check personalGrossIncome >=600. Else, familyGrossIncome >=900. The income's reducesChildSupplementTo must be >0. The user's hasConsiderableAssets must be false. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit should be true, but that's a data property on the user. Also, the user must not have other benefits that take priority, which is covered by the child's shape.\n\nI need to structure the NodeShapes. The main shape (ff:KinderzuschlagShape) targets User. It requires the receivesChildBenefitFor with a ChildShape. The income conditions use sh:or with two shapes for couple vs single. The income reduction check uses the hasIncome's reducesChildSupplementTo path. The considerable assets are a direct check on the user. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is another property on the user needing to be true.\n\nWait, the ontology's ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is a data property on Person, so the user must have that as true. Also, the 'nachrangig' part requires the child to have no priority claims, which is already in the ChildShape via hasNoPriorityClaimsOver.\n\nLet me check the ontology again. For 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver', the domain is Person and range SocialBenefit. So the child must have an edge to the benefit indicating no priority claims over it. So in ChildShape, the property path would be ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with value the benefit's ID.\n\nPutting this together in Turtle. The shapes for income are similar to the example. Also, the user must have canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit true. Need to include that as a property in the main shape.\n\nI think that's all. Now, structure the SHACL accordingly, making sure all conditions are covered with appropriate paths and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_581863 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Kinderzuschlag\"@de, \"Child supplement\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # At least one eligible child\n        sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"No eligible child found meeting all requirements.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        ff:IncomeShapeCouple\n        ff:IncomeShapeSingle\n    ) ;\n    # Income reduction must not nullify supplement\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo) ;\n        sh:minExclusive 0 ;\n        sh:message \"Child supplement would be reduced to zero.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # No considerable assets\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Considerable assets disqualify eligibility.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Can cover family needs with combined income/benefits\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Incomes do not cover family basic needs.\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# CHILD SHAPE\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Under 25 years old\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 25 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not married/civil union\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Same household as user\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over this benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ] .\n\n# INCOME SHAPE FOR COUPLES\nff:IncomeShapeCouple a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in (false) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n        sh:message \"Family gross income below required threshold.\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# INCOME SHAPE FOR SINGLE PARENTS\nff:IncomeShapeSingle a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n        sh:message \"Personal gross income below required threshold.\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL shape for the 'Bürgergeld' (Citizen benefit) with the IDLB B100019_LB_106311931 based on the given conditions. Let me go through the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be employable. The definition says they need to be able to work at least 3 hours a day and be at least 15 years old, but not have reached the retirement age. The retirement age is mentioned as 67 for those born after 1963, but varies for others. However, since SHACL can't handle dynamic age checks based on birth year directly, maybe we can use the 'hasAge' data property. The age must be between 15 and below the retirement age. But how do I represent the retirement age? The ontology has 'isPensionable' which is true if they've reached retirement age. So, the user's age must be >=15 and 'isPensionable' must be false.\n\nNext, they must be needy. This means they can't cover their basic needs and those of their dependent household members with their own income/assets, or priority benefits. The ontology has 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' which should be false. Also, they must not have priority claims over other benefits. The 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' object property should link to the relevant benefits like 'Wohngeld', 'Arbeitslosengeld', etc. Wait, the text says \"no priority claims over other providers or persons.\" The ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' which links to the SocialBenefit instances. So the user must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to each of those benefits. But how to list them? The examples used hasValue for a specific benefit. Maybe we need to require that for all required benefits, the user has a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver relation. Alternatively, perhaps the shape should check that the user has no such claims over any of the priority benefits listed. But in SHACL, maybe we can use sh:property with sh:hasValue for each of those benefits, but that might be too specific. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be receiving those benefits. Wait, the condition says they can't have priority claims, which might mean they aren't eligible for them. Alternatively, perhaps the 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' being false already implies that. Maybe I should focus on the data properties here.\n\nThe user must live in Germany. The 'countryOfResidence' should be Germany (ff:Germany).\n\nAlso, they need to be in Germany as their country of residence. So:\n\n- ff:countryOfResidence = ff:Germany\n\nFor the employment status: being employable. The ontology has 'employableHoursPerDay' which should be >=3. And 'hasAge' >=15, and 'isPensionable' is false.\n\nThe needy part: 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' is false.\n\nThe 'no priority claims' part: For each relevant benefit (like Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag), the user must have a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not be receiving those benefits. Wait, the text says \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern (zum Beispiel Wohngeld, Arbeitslosengeld, Kinderzuschlag)\". So they must not have claims over those benefits, meaning they are not eligible for them. So perhaps the user must not be receiving those benefits, or have an explicit hasNoPriorityClaimsOver. Since the ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver', maybe we require that the user has that relation with each of the priority benefits. But which benefits are considered priority here? The examples list Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, and Kinderzuschlag. Looking at the ontology, those are:\n\n- Arbeitslosengeld: ff:B100019_LB_576842\n- Wohngeld: ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n- Kinderzuschlag: ff:B100019_LB_581863\n\nSo the user must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver each of these. In SHACL, to check that for each of these benefits, the user has a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link. Since SHACL can't loop through, perhaps we need a sh:property for each. Alternatively, maybe the user must have at least one such link, but that's not correct. The condition requires that for all those benefits, the user has no priority. So each must be present. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be receiving those benefits, but that's different. Hmm. The exact wording is \"haben keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern [...] oder anderen Personen\". So the user must not have priority claims over those benefits, meaning they can't claim those benefits before others. So the user must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to each of those benefits.\n\nTherefore, for each of the listed benefits, the user must have a triple like user ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver benefit. To model this in SHACL, each benefit must be a value in the list. So in SHACL, we can have multiple sh:property constraints each requiring that the user has hasNoPriorityClaimsOver each of the specific benefits. Alternatively, perhaps using sh:in with a list of the benefits. Wait, but how to specify multiple required properties? Maybe three separate sh:property blocks each checking one of the benefits.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape will target ff:User and have several constraints:\n\n1. Country of residence is Germany.\n2. Age >=15 (using ff:hasAge >= 15)\n3. Not pensionable (ff:isPensionable is false)\n4. Employable hours per day >=3 (ff:employableHoursPerDay >= 3)\n5. Can't cover basic needs (ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false)\n6. For each priority benefit (Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag), the user has hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to them.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the user must not be receiving those benefits? But the condition is about having priority claims, so perhaps just the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is sufficient.\n\nNow, let's structure this in SHACL.\n\nFirst, define the NodeShape for Bürgergeld:\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Country of residence is Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"User must reside in Germany.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Age >=15\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:message \"User must be at least 15 years old.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not pensionable (isPensionable is false)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must not have reached pensionable age.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Employable hours per day >=3\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive 3 ;\n        sh:message \"User must be able to work at least 3 hours daily.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Can't cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unable to cover basic needs with own means or priority benefits.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority over Arbeitslosengeld\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; # Arbeitslosengeld\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over unemployment benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority over Wohngeld\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ; # Wohngeld\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over housing benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority over Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ; # Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over child supplement.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but each of these hasNoPriorityClaimsOver needs to be present for each benefit. So each of those three properties must exist. So each sh:property block checks that the user has a triple with that specific benefit as the object. Since SHACL allows multiple such constraints, each ensuring one of the three, that should work.\n\nAlso, check if there's any other conditions. The original text mentions \"leben in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" which is covered by the countryOfResidence.\n\nAnother point: The employable part also requires that the user hasn't reached the retirement age, which is handled by isPensionable being false.\n\nThe needy part: 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' must be false.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Now, let's write the Turtle code accordingly, ensuring all prefixes are correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931_Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Resides in Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"User must reside in Germany.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Age at least 15 years\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"User must be at least 15 years old.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not pensionable (has not reached retirement age)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must not have reached pensionable age.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Minimum 3 hours daily work capacity\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"User must be able to work at least 3 hours daily.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Inability to cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unable to cover basic needs with own means/priority benefits.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over unemployment benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; # Arbeitslosengeld\n        sh:message \"User must not have priority claims over unemployment benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over housing benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ; # Wohngeld\n        sh:message \"User must not have priority claims over housing benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over child supplement\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ; # Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:message \"User must not have priority claims over child supplement.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit described in the given text. Let me start by understanding the requirements provided. \n\nThe benefit is \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user must receive benefits from the basic security (Grundsicherung).\n2. The need for the support was determined in a discussion with their integration specialist.\n3. Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the start of the measure.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to map these conditions to the available properties and classes. \n\nFirst, the basic security benefit is likely the \"Grundsicherung\" which in the ontology examples is represented by \"L100040_LB_8664880\". Wait, in the example provided earlier, the housing benefit is \"L100040_LB_8665924\" (Wohngeld), so maybe the Grundsicherung is another individual. Wait, looking at the ontology's individuals:\n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals section, there's \"IntegrationAssistance\" which is a SocialBenefit. But the user receives \"Grundsicherung\" which might be \"Sozialhilfe\" (SocialAssistance) in German. Checking the ontology, there's an individual called \"SocialAssistance\" (Types: ff:SocialBenefit). Yes, that's probably the Grundsicherung. So the first condition would require that the user is receiving SocialAssistance. \n\nWait, the example uses \"L100040_LB_8664880\" but in the ontology, the individual with that label is \"L100040_LB_8665924\" which is Wohngeld (housing benefit). Wait, perhaps there's a typo here. Wait, the example in the problem's examples section has:\n\nIn the example given, the SHACL code uses \"sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880\" for Grundsicherung, but in the ontology, the actual individual for Wohngeld is L100040_LB_8665924. Maybe there's an error here, but I'll follow the example's approach. Wait, perhaps in the ontology, there's another entry. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals section:\n\nIndividual: ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n    Annotations: rdfs:label \"Housing benefit\"@en, rdfs:label \"Wohngeld\"@de\n    Types: ff:SocialBenefit \n\nHmm, so maybe the Grundsicherung (basic security) is represented by another individual. Let me see:\n\nIn the ontology, there's an individual called \"IntegrationAssistance\" which is a SocialBenefit. Wait, perhaps \"Grundsicherung\" is \"Sozialhilfe\" which is \"SocialAssistance\" in the ontology. Yes, the ontology has \"SocialAssistance\" as a SocialBenefit. So the user must be receiving SocialAssistance. So the first condition's SHACL constraint is that the user has a receivesBenefit link to SocialAssistance. Wait, the ontology has the object property \"receivesBenefit\" which links a person to a SocialBenefit. So the first condition would be that the user has at least one \"receivesBenefit\" to SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: The need was determined in a discussion with an integration specialist. The ontology has an object property called \"participates\" which links a person to a program like training. But how to represent the discussion with an integration specialist? Maybe there's a property related to having an integration specialist, but I don't see one in the ontology. The examples use \"Integrationfachkraft\" but the ontology might not have a direct property for that. The problem states not to model ambiguous requirements. Since the ontology doesn't have a property indicating that the need was determined by an integration specialist, maybe this condition can't be modeled. The user might not have a direct way to represent this in the data. The instruction says not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. So this second condition might be excluded because it's up to a third party's determination.\n\nThird condition: Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure started. The Jobcenter is \"FederalEmploymentAgency\" in the ontology (an individual of RehabilitationProvider). The participation is a Training (since the benefit is for measures like training). The ontology has \"subjectToContract\" property for Training, which links to VocationalTrainingContract, but maybe \"commissionedByEmploymentAgency\" is a data property. Wait, yes, there's \"commissionedByEmploymentAgency\" which is a data property on Training, with range boolean. So if the Training was commissioned by the employment agency (FederalEmploymentAgency), then this is true. Alternatively, perhaps the Training instance has a \"commissionedByEmploymentAgency\" set to true. \n\nBut the exact way to model this is that the user's participation in a Training must have been approved by the Jobcenter. The ontology has \"participates\" linking the user to a Training. So maybe the user's Training must have the commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true. So the user must have a Training that they participate in, and that Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe SHACL shape should target ff:User. \n\nFirst condition: User must have a receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition is ambiguous and possibly third party's decision, so omit.\n\nThird condition: User must have a participates link to a Training which has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\nFor the first condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nFor the third condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n        sh:message \"...\";\n    ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL path: \n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, maybe better to structure it as a nested property. The user must participate in a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nAlternatively, the path for the Training's property can be checked via a nested shape. \n\nAlternatively, using a property path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nYes, that might work. The user must have at least one participates link where the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe shape for the benefit would have two constraints: \n\n1. Receives SocialAssistance\n2. Participates in a Training where commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nNow, the IDLB is B100019_LB_102730340, but in the ontology, there's an example with B100019_LB_102716305, which is labeled as \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld\". The user's benefit has a different ID. Since the ontology doesn't list this specific ID, but the task requires creating the SHACL for the given benefit, we can define the benefit as an individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nNow, the NodeShape would target ff:User and have the two constraints.\n\nAlso, the example uses \"checksFundingRequirement\" as a custom predicate. The example's shape has ff:checksFundingRequirement pointing to the benefit. So perhaps we should include that too.\n\nThus, the final SHACL would look like:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102730340 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # First condition: User receives SocialAssistance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not receive basic security benefits\" ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Third condition: Participation in training approved by Jobcenter\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ; # Ensure the object is a Training\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            sh:message \"Participation not approved by Jobcenter\" ;\n        ]\n    ] .\n```\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the nested property might need to be structured differently. Alternatively, using a path and constraints on the path.\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL property shape for the participates path with a constraint on the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:Training ; # Ensure it's a Training instance\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"User must participate in a Jobcenter-approved training\" ;\n]\n\nThat might be better. Because qualifiedMinCount ensures that at least one of the participates links meets the condition.\n\nYes, that's probably the right approach. So the second constraint would use a qualified value shape to check that the Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would have two properties:\n\n- ReceivesBenefit to SocialAssistance\n- Participates in a Training (ff:participates) which must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true.\n\nSo the SHACL code would be as follows.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\n# Define the validation shape\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102730340 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Requirement 1: User must receive Social Assistance (Grundsicherung)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives basic security benefits'\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Requirement 3: Participation must be approved by Jobcenter (commissioned training)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;  # Ensure participates points to Training instance\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Participation must be Jobcenter-approved training'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (B100019_LB_582429). The user provided an example, so I should follow that structure.\n\nFirst, the requirements: the user must have statutory accident insurance and be unfit for work due to an insurance event (work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease).\n\nLooking at the ontology, the StatutoryAccidentInsurance is an individual of type Insurance. So the first constraint is that the user has this insurance via ff:hasInsurance. The example uses sh:hasValue to specify the exact insurance, so I'll do the same here.\n\nNext, the earning capacity must be UnfitForWork. The example uses sh:in to check the value and references a node shape for the triggering event. The triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent) must be one of the allowed classes: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nI'll create a node shape (CapacityReductionShape) for the EarningCapacity that checks the triggeringEvent's class. The example uses sh:or with sh:class for each allowed class. Need to make sure to include all three.\n\nAlso, ensure that the targetNode is ff:User and all components are SHACL Core. Don't add extra terms not in the ontology. The example didn't have any other constraints, so I think that's all. Let me check the ontology again for any missing properties, but the requirements seem covered. \n\nWait, the example's CapacityReductionShape is linked via sh:node in the property shape. So the EarningCapacity node must conform to that shape. That's correct here. Also, the messages should be in English as per the example. \n\nI think that's it. Now, structure the Turtle code accordingly, making sure prefixes are correct and syntax valid.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582429 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance injury allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVVerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582429 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: User has statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance\"@en\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: User is unfit for work due to valid insurance event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:UnfitForWork ) ;\n        sh:node ff:EarningCapacityValidation ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unfit for work due to valid insurance event\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# Shape for validating earning capacity reduction cause\nff:EarningCapacityValidation a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Triggering event must be work/commuting accident or occupational disease\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Bildung und Teilhabe' with IDLB L100040_LB_12280162. I need to make sure I understand the requirements first. The user must be eligible based on either receiving one of the listed benefits or if they can't cover the costs themselves and get an individual assessment. Also, age limits are up to 25 for education and 18 for social/cultural participation.\n\nStarting with the target node, it's always ff:User, so the NodeShape will target that. The conditions involve checking if the user is receiving certain benefits or qualifies through an individual assessment. The listed benefits are Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931), Wohngeld (ff:L100040_LB_8665924), Kinderzuschlag (ff:B100019_LB_581863), Sozialhilfe (ff:SocialAssistance), Asylbewerberleistungen (ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits), or if their family has low income.\n\nFirst, I need a shape that checks if the user is receiving any of these benefits. Using sh:or for each benefit. Also, there's an alternative path if they can't cover costs and have an assessment. But the problem says \"the possibility to have their claim assessed\" might not be directly modelable. Since the user must either receive one of the benefits or meet the other condition. Wait, the text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann, hat die Möglichkeit, seinen individuellen Anspruch...\" So if they don't get the benefits but can't cover costs, they can be assessed. But the SHACL must model eligibility based on these conditions. However, modeling the possibility of an assessment might not be straightforward. The user's eligibility would require either:\n\n1. They or their family receive one of the listed benefits, OR\n2. They can't cover costs themselves and have had an assessment.\n\nBut the SHACL needs to validate existing data. The second condition might require checking data properties like canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit or something similar. However, the exact ontology terms need to be checked. Let me check the ontology again.\n\nLooking at data properties related to income and coverage:\n\n- ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit: True if can cover basic needs with income/assets/priority benefits.\n\nWait, the condition says \"die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann\" which would mean can't cover those costs themselves. Maybe that's represented by a property like ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver or something else? Alternatively, perhaps the ontology has a property indicating inability to cover costs, but I might need to see if there's a data property for that. Alternatively, maybe ff:hasConsiderableAssets is the opposite. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds set to false, but that's about personal basic needs. The requirement is about covering the costs for education and participation. Since the ontology might not have a direct property for this, perhaps the problem states to ignore ambiguous requirements. Since the text says \"has the possibility to have their claim assessed\", but SHACL can't model that unless there's a property indicating an assessment has been done. Since the examples didn't include that, maybe we can focus only on the first part (receiving the benefits) and the age limit, as the other part might be ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n\nTherefore, the main conditions are:\n\n- The user is under 25 (hasAge <25)\n- Either:\n   a) The user or their family receives one of the listed benefits, OR\n   b) They qualify through the individual assessment (but maybe this can't be modeled and is excluded due to ambiguity)\n\nWait, the text says \"der Leistungsanspruch gilt für Kinder und junge Menschen bis zur Vollendung des 25. Lebensjahres.\" So age is a must. The benefits part: the user or their family must receive one of the benefits. So for the first part, checking if the user has a ff:receivesBenefit link to any of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen). Also, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" – that might translate to the family's income being below a threshold. The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome in ff:Income, but how is that linked? Maybe the user's income has familyGrossIncome below a certain value, but since the exact threshold isn't given, perhaps it's represented by another property. Alternatively, maybe the 'family with low income' is covered by existing properties like ff:hasConsiderableAssets (if false) or ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. Since the problem says to not model ambiguous requirements, maybe the low income is considered part of the listed benefits or requires a property that's not present. Since the examples use minCount and hasValue, perhaps the family income part is considered as part of the listed benefits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'family with low income' is separate and needs a different check. Let me parse the requirements again:\n\nThe user is eligible if they or their family receive one of the listed benefits OR their family has low income. Wait, the original German says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another option. So the user must be in a family with low income even if not receiving the benefits. So the user must satisfy either:\n\n- receiving one of the listed benefits, or\n- their family has low income.\n\nBut how to model \"family with low income\"? The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome in Income. So perhaps the user's income (ff:hasIncome) has a familyGrossIncome below a certain threshold. But the problem doesn't specify the exact value, so maybe this can't be modeled and we have to exclude it. Since the task says not to model ambiguous requirements, perhaps only the listed benefits and the age are considered.\n\nWait the problem says \"Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\" So the family income part might be ambiguous, so we might only include the benefits part. Let me recheck the text:\n\n\"Anspruchsberechtigt sind junge Menschen, wenn sie, beziehungsweise ihre Familien, eine der folgenden Leistungen beziehen: [list], Familien mit geringem Einkommen.\"\n\nSo the user or their family must receive one of the benefits OR their family has low income. But since \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition, it's separate from the listed benefits. But modeling that requires knowing if the family's income is low. Since the ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome, maybe we can check that it's below a certain threshold. But the problem doesn't specify the threshold, so that's ambiguous. Therefore, we can exclude that part. So only the benefits part and age are modeled.\n\nWait, but the user can also be eligible if they don't receive the benefits but can't cover costs and get assessed. But since that assessment is a possibility, maybe that's also at the discretion of third parties, so it's excluded. Thus, the main requirements are:\n\n1. User has age <25 (ff:hasAge <25)\n2. User or their family receives at least one of the listed benefits.\n\nNow, the listed benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931)\n- Wohngeld (L100040_LB_8665924)\n- Kinderzuschlag (B100019_LB_581863)\n- Sozialhilfe (SocialAssistance)\n- Asylbewerberleistungen (AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n\nAlso, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition but might be ambiguous.\n\nSo for the first part, the user must be receiving one of those benefits, or their family does. But how to model \"their family\"? The ontology has relationships like ff:hasChild, ff:parentalAdress, but maybe the family is linked via some properties. Alternatively, maybe the user's family's benefits are represented via ff:receivesBenefit on the user, but the problem states \"sie oder ihre Familien\" so the user themselves or their family members. This complicates things because SHACL can't traverse to family members unless there's a property linking to them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's own benefits are sufficient, and the \"family\" part is considered as part of the listed benefits (like Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag are family-related). Maybe the problem expects to check if the user is receiving any of those benefits, regardless of being for the family.\n\nWait, the user's own receivesBenefit would link to the benefits they personally receive. For example, if the user is a child, their parent's Wohngeld might not be linked to the user. Since the ontology doesn't have a clear way to express family members' benefits, maybe this is ambiguous and we can only check the user's own benefits.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that the user or their family receives the benefits, but without ontology terms to model family members' benefits, this can't be done. Hence, perhaps only the user's own receivesBenefit is considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's family is considered via ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker or other family links, but that's unclear. Given the ontology's properties, perhaps the best we can do is check if the user is receiving any of the listed benefits. So the SHACL would require that the user has at least one of those benefits in their ff:receivesBenefit list, and their age is under 25.\n\nWait the problem says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition, but without data properties, maybe it's excluded. So the main conditions are age <25 and receiving at least one of the listed benefits. The other conditions (like the possibility of assessment) are not modeled because they are at the discretion of third parties or ambiguous.\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nThe shape for the benefit (L100040_LB_12280162) would target ff:User. The properties would be:\n\n- hasAge must be less than 25 (sh:maxExclusive 25)\n- must have at least one of the listed benefits in receivesBenefit OR (but this is OR with other conditions that might not be modeled). Since the other conditions are excluded, the main requirement is that the user has at least one of the benefits listed.\n\nWait, but the user can be eligible either via receiving the benefits OR via family low income (excluded) or via the individual assessment (excluded). So the only modelable condition is the benefits and age.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would require:\n\n1. hasAge <25\n2. receivesBenefit includes at least one of the listed benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the benefit also covers Teilhabe (social/cultural participation) up to 18. But that's part of the benefit's scope, not an eligibility condition. The eligibility is up to 25 for education and 18 for Teilhabe, but the user just needs to be under 25 overall.\n\nSo the SHACL would look like:\n\nThe NodeShape for the benefit would have:\n\n- A property for hasAge with maxExclusive 25\n- A property for receivesBenefit with sh:hasValue for each of the benefits, using sh:or.\n\nWait, the benefits are multiple, so the sh:or would be for each of the listed benefits. Alternatively, since the user needs to have at least one of them, the path ff:receivesBenefit must have at least one of the listed instances.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]  # Bürgergeld\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]    # Wohngeld\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]     # Kinderzuschlag\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]      # Sozialhilfe\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ]  # Asylbewerberleistungen\n    )\n]\n\nAdditionally, the age condition.\n\nAlso, the benefit's ID is L100040_LB_12280162, so the SocialBenefit individual should be defined with that IRI.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\nff:L100040_LB_12280162Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"The user must be under 25 years old.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]  # Bürgergeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]    # Wohngeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]     # Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]      # Sozialhilfe\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ]  # Asylbewerberleistungen\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"The user must receive at least one of the specified benefits.\"@en\n    ] .\n\nWait but the user can also be eligible via their family's benefits, but that's unclear in the ontology. Since we can't model family links, perhaps this is the best we can do.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which we can't model, so it's excluded. The other part about individual assessment is also excluded.\n\nTherefore, this should be the SHACL graph.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Age requirement: under 25 years\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"User must be under 25 years old.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must receive one of the listed benefits\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ] # Bürgergeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]   # Wohngeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]    # Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]     # Sozialhilfe\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] # Asylbewerberleistungen\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must receive one of the listed benefits: Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, or Asylbewerberleistungen.\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the given social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\" (Statutory Accident Insurance Pension) with IDLB B100019_LB_582404. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nThe benefit is provided if the person is statutorily accident insured and meets the following conditions:\n\n1. Their earning capacity is reduced:\n   * due to one or more insurance events,\n   * beyond the 26th week after the insurance event,\n   * by at least 20%.\n\nFirst, I'll check the ontology for the relevant properties and classes. The user must be linked to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance for being insured. The earning capacity must be reduced (ff:ReducedEarningCapacity?), and the reduction needs to be at least 20% (ff:reductionInPercent). Also, the reduction must be beyond 26 weeks (ff:reductionDurationInWeeks), and the cause should be an insurance event (ff:Event, maybe via ff:triggeringEvent).\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:EarningCapacity has properties like reductionInPercent and reductionDurationInWeeks. The triggeringEvent for EarningCapacity would link to the insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.). The insurance event must be of a type that's covered under statutory accident insurance, such as WorkAccident, SchoolAccident, etc.\n\nSo, the SHACL shape should target ff:User and include constraints for:\n\n- Must have an ff:hasEarningCapacity that is a ReducedEarningCapacity (or has properties indicating reduction).\n- The reductionInPercent must be >= 20.\n- The reductionDurationInWeeks must be >=27 (since it's beyond the 26th week).\n- The triggeringEvent of the EarningCapacity must be an instance of an insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.).\n- The user must have ff:hasInsurance as ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure the insurance event is part of the accident insurance? The insurance event's type might need to be checked. Alternatively, since the user has StatutoryAccidentInsurance, any event covered by that insurance would be relevant. Maybe the triggeringEvent's type is an Event that's covered by accident insurance, but the ontology might not specify that. The example in the problem doesn't model such constraints, so perhaps we just check that there's a triggering event linked.\n\nSo, structuring the SHACL:\n\n1. The user must have an EarningCapacity with:\n   - reductionInPercent >= 20 (using sh:minInclusive)\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27 (sh:minInclusive)\n   - The triggeringEvent must exist (sh:minCount 1)\n\n2. The user must have ff:hasInsurance including ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nWait, the ontology's ff:hasInsurance is an object property to ff:Insurance. So the user should have ff:hasInsurance with value ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nAdditionally, the EarningCapacity must have a triggeringEvent that is an instance of an Event (but maybe any event, as long as it's part of the insurance cases).\n\nPutting this together in Turtle:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- TargetNode: ff:User\n- Properties for hasInsurance, hasEarningCapacity, and constraints on EarningCapacity's properties.\n\nWait, the EarningCapacity must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity? Or does the EarningCapacity just have to have those properties set? The ontology defines ff:ReducedEarningCapacity as an instance of EarningCapacity, so perhaps the user's earning capacity must be an instance of ReducedEarningCapacity, but maybe it's better to check the properties instead. Since the problem says \"reduction of at least 20%\", maybe the EarningCapacity doesn't have to be exactly ReducedEarningCapacity, but just have the properties set. However, the ontology might expect that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an EarningCapacity that is a ReducedEarningCapacity (since that's an instance), but also with the required properties. Let me check the ontology:\n\nIn the ontology, there's an individual ff:ReducedEarningCapacity of type EarningCapacity. So perhaps the user's earning capacity must be that instance. But the problem says \"reduction of at least 20%\", so maybe that instance already represents a reduction, but the exact percentage is captured in reductionInPercent.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user's earning capacity must be an instance of EarningCapacity (could be ReducedEarningCapacity), and then the properties on that instance must meet the criteria.\n\nSo, the SHACL could have:\n\nFor the earning capacity:\n\n- The user must have at least one ff:hasEarningCapacity (sh:minCount 1)\n- The earning capacity must have:\n   - reductionInPercent >=20\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27\n   - a triggeringEvent (sh:minCount 1)\n\nAdditionally, the user must have the insurance.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would look like this:\n\nFirst, define the shape for the User:\n\nff:GUV_Rente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ;  # Ensure it's an EarningCapacity instance\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but SHACL doesn't have a sh:class constraint in the core components. Oh right, the core components don't include sh:class. The user must use only SHACL Core components. So maybe instead, the hasEarningCapacity must have a value that is an instance of EarningCapacity, but how? Since SHACL core doesn't have that, perhaps it's better to not enforce that and rely on the ontology's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triggeringEvent must be an Event that's linked via ff:triggeringEvent to the EarningCapacity.\n\nAlso, the reduction must be due to insurance events. But how to check that the triggeringEvent is an insurance event? The insurance events are subclasses of Event, like WorkAccident, etc. Since the ontology has those subclasses, perhaps the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of them, but SHACL can't check for subclass membership with core components. So maybe that's out of scope unless the problem allows it. Since the user says to not model ambiguous parts, perhaps we can just require that the triggeringEvent exists, and assume that the application data will have the correct events.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triggering event must be of a type covered by accident insurance, but since the ontology doesn't have a property indicating that, maybe it's not possible. So proceed without that check.\n\nAlso, the reduction must be due to one or more insurance events. The triggeringEvent could be one such event, but the problem says \"eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle\" (one or more insurance cases). So perhaps the earning capacity's triggeringEvent could be a list, but in SHACL, maybe we just ensure at least one exists.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape would include the insurance, the earning capacity with the required properties, and the triggering event.\n\nWait, the user needs to have at least one triggering event for the earning capacity. So the hasEarningCapacity's triggeringEvent must have min count 1.\n\nAdditionally, the reduction must be due to one or more insurance events, but since SHACL can't enforce \"one or more\", but the triggeringEvent's existence is enough for at least one, perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL would look like the above, but without the sh:class.\n\nWait, the hasEarningCapacity must have at least one instance of EarningCapacity. But SHACL can't enforce that, so perhaps it's okay as long as the path exists and the properties are there.\n\nAlso, the user must be statutorily insured via ff:hasInsurance including ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nAnother point: The reduction must be due to an insurance event (Versicherungsfälle), which are events covered by the insurance. Since the insurance is StatutoryAccidentInsurance, the triggeringEvent should be one of the accident events (WorkAccident, etc.), but again, SHACL can't check that with core components unless the event's type is listed as a subclass. Since the ontology has those subclasses, maybe we can require that the triggeringEvent is an instance of, say, ff:Event, but that's redundant because it's already a subclass of Event. Hmm, perhaps it's better to not include that and rely on the data's correctness.\n\nThus, the final SHACL would be as I outlined above.\n\nWait, also the reduction must be \"infolge eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle\" - so the triggering event(s) must be insurance events. But without knowing the exact properties, perhaps it's sufficient that the triggeringEvent exists, as the user is already insured, so the events are covered by the insurance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triggeringEvent is linked via ff:hasEvent or another property, but the ontology shows that ff:triggeringEvent is defined for EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation, so it's correct.\n\nThus, the SHACL constraints are:\n\n- User must have ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance (sh:hasValue)\n- User must have a ff:hasEarningCapacity (minCount 1)\n   - That earning capacity must have reductionInPercent >=20 (decimal)\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27 (int)\n   - triggeringEvent exists (minCount 1)\n\nSo the Turtle code would be:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Metadata for the benefit\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# Shape for validation\nff:GUV_Rente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be statutorily accident insured.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have an earning capacity with required reductions\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have an earning capacity with required reductions.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n            sh:message \"Reduction must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"A triggering insurance event must be present.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Metadata for the benefit\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# Shape for validation\nff:GUV_Rente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Statutory accident insurance must be present\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be statutorily accident insured.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: Reduced earning capacity due to insurance event(s)\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a reduced earning capacity.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction must be ≥20% (reductionInPercent ≥20)\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction must persist beyond 26 weeks (reductionDurationInWeeks ≥27)\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must last at least 27 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Must have a triggering insurance event (e.g., accident)\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"A qualifying insurance event must have triggered the reduction.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' (B100019_LB_582441). Let's start by understanding the requirements from the given text.\n\nFirst, the eligibility criteria are:\n\n1. The user's spouse or civil partner died due to an insured event (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease).\n2. The user was in a valid marriage or civil partnership before the event.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n- If the marriage or partnership was formed after the insured event, and the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nLooking at the example provided, they used shapes to model these conditions. The example used ff:deceasedCivilPartner and ff:deceasedSpouse to link to the deceased partner, then checked if the causeOfDeath was an insurance event (WorkAccident etc.), and ensured the user was in a legal union before the event via legalUnionBeforeEvent.\n\nNow, I need to translate the exclusion into SHACL. The exclusion says that if the user formed the union after the event AND the death was within the first year, they are ineligible. So, the inverse would be that either the union was before the event OR the death wasn't within the first year. But since SHACL is about constraints for eligibility, we have to model this as a condition that must NOT be met. Alternatively, the constraint must ensure that the exclusion scenario is not present.\n\nAlternatively, the eligibility requires that it is NOT the case that the user formed the union after the event and the death was within the first year. To model this, maybe using sh:not in SHACL.\n\nBreaking down the exclusion:\n\nExclusion condition is (UnionAfterEvent AND DeathWithinFirstYear). The user must NOT meet this. So, the shape should have a constraint that (UnionAfterEvent AND DeathWithinFirstYear) is false. \n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? Let's think. The exclusion's first part is \"Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben\" which means the user entered the marriage/civil partnership after the insured event. The second part is \"der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist\" which is the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nTo model this, for each deceased partner (spouse or civil partner), we need to check:\n\nIf the marriage/civil partnership was formed after the event (the causeOfDeath event?), and the death occurred within the first year of the marriage/partnership.\n\nBut how to capture the timeline? The event (causeOfDeath) must have happened before the marriage, which is the opposite of the exclusion's first condition. Wait no: the exclusion's first condition is that the union was formed AFTER the event. So if that's true, then the user is excluded.\n\nSo the constraint for eligibility is that it's NOT the case that (union after event AND death within first year of union).\n\nBut in SHACL, constraints are for things that must hold. So perhaps the shape must ensure that either the union was not formed after the event, or the death was not within the first year.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL should enforce that either:\n\n- The union was formed before the event, OR\n\n- The death occurred more than one year after the union was formed.\n\nBut how to represent that?\n\nFirst, the event (the causeOfDeath) has a date (hasDate), and the marriage has a start date (when did the user form the union with the deceased?).\n\nWait, the ontology has properties like legalUnionBeforeEvent, which connects the event to the partner. So maybe the legalUnionBeforeEvent is already indicating that the user was in the union before the event. Wait, in the example, they required that the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. That might already handle the first part (the union was before the event). \n\nWait, the example's InsuranceEventShape has a property:\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n\nWhich ensures that the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. That would mean that the user was in the union before the event. So that handles the main eligibility condition. But the exclusion is about forming the union AFTER the event. So if the legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user, that implies the union was before the event, so it's okay. So the main condition is already covered. \n\nNow for the exclusion's second part: death within first year of the union. But the exclusion only applies if the union was formed after the event, which is already excluded by the main condition. Wait no, because the example's constraint already requires that the user was in the union before the event. So the exclusion's first condition (union formed after the event) would already be excluded by that. So maybe the exclusion's first condition is already handled by the existing constraint. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The example's InsuranceEventShape has the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user, which would mean that the user was in the union before the event. So if the user entered the union after the event, that would fail the main eligibility, so the exclusion's first part can't occur if the main condition is met. Therefore, perhaps the exclusion is redundant in this case. Wait, but the exclusion is part of the conditions given, so maybe I need to model it even if it's overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exclusion is an additional condition. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe main eligibility criteria are the two points. The exclusion is a case where even if those are met, they are not eligible. Wait, no: the exclusion says \"Sie haben in der Regel keinen Anspruch, wenn [condition]\". So if the user meets the exclusion condition, they are not eligible, even if the main criteria are met. So it's an additional condition to check for ineligibility.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL must include constraints for both the eligibility criteria and exclude the cases where the exclusion applies.\n\nHmm, but how to model that. Because SHACL is for defining what must be true for eligibility. So perhaps the exclusion criteria must be turned into constraints that must NOT be true. \n\nAlternatively, the exclusion condition must not be met. So the SHACL shape must have a constraint that the exclusion scenario is not present.\n\nThe exclusion scenario is:\n\n(UnionAfterEvent AND DeathWithinFirstYearOfUnion)\n\nTo ensure that this is false, the constraints must ensure that either:\n\nUnion was not after the event (i.e., before or same time as event)\n\nOR\n\nDeath not within first year of the union.\n\nBut how to represent these in SHACL?\n\nFirst, to check whether the union was after the event. The event has a date (hasDate). The union's start date would be the marriage or civil partnership start date. But the ontology doesn't have a property that directly captures when the marriage was formed. The ontology has legalUnionBeforeEvent, but that's a property of the event, pointing to the user, indicating that the user was in the union before the event. So if the marriage was after the event, then legalUnionBeforeEvent would not include the user, so the main condition would fail. Thus, the main eligibility condition already ensures that the union was before the event. Therefore, the first part of the exclusion (UnionAfterEvent) is already excluded by the main condition. Therefore, the only part left is the second part of the exclusion, but since the first part is already excluded, perhaps the exclusion's second part is irrelevant?\n\nWait, perhaps the exclusion scenario is when the user formed the union after the event (which is excluded by the main condition), AND the death occurred within the first year of the union. Since the main condition already requires the union was before the event, the exclusion's first condition can't be met, so the entire exclusion scenario is already excluded. Therefore, maybe the exclusion can be ignored, because it's already covered by the main condition?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where the union was formed after the event, but the legalUnionBeforeEvent still points to the user. That would be a contradiction. So perhaps the exclusion is redundant and doesn't need to be modeled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exclusion is about forming the union after the event, but the legalUnionBeforeEvent is required to include the user. Therefore, the exclusion scenario can't happen because if the user entered the union after the event, then legalUnionBeforeEvent wouldn't include them, so the main condition would already fail, making them ineligible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the exclusion is redundant and doesn't require an additional constraint. So the example's SHACL is sufficient.\n\nWait, but the problem's text includes the exclusion, so perhaps I should model it. Let me read again the exclusion:\n\nSie haben in der Regel keinen Anspruch, wenn\n\n  * Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben und\n  * der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist.\n\nSo, if both conditions are met (union after the event and death within first year), then they are excluded. \n\nThe main condition requires that the user was in the union before the event (so the first part of the exclusion's condition is the opposite). Therefore, the exclusion's first condition can't be true if the main condition is met. Therefore, the exclusion's scenario is already excluded. So maybe the SHACL provided in the example is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL from the example should work, but let me check again.\n\nThe example's shape for InsuranceEventShape has:\n\n- The causeOfDeath must be one of the three event types (WorkAccident etc.)\n\n- legalUnionBeforeEvent must include the user (so the union was before the event)\n\nSo any user meeting the main criteria is eligible, and the exclusion scenario is already excluded because the first part of the exclusion (union after event) would fail the legalUnionBeforeEvent condition.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL in the example is correct, and the exclusion condition doesn't need to be modeled separately.\n\nThus, the correct SHACL should be as in the example, but using the correct identifiers. Wait, the problem's example's SHACL uses the ff:B100019_LB_582441 as the SocialBenefit, which matches the current problem's benefit ID. Therefore, the example provided is actually the solution for this problem. Wait, looking back, the user provided an example with the same benefit, so perhaps the answer is the same as the example?\n\nWait, the user's input says \"TEXT: Es folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582441. [...] SHACL: [example]\".\n\nThen the current problem's TEXT is the same as the example's TEXT, so the answer is the same SHACL as the example? That can't be. Wait no, maybe the user is providing the example as a solved example to learn from, and now the actual task is another benefit, but the problem here is the same as the example. Wait looking at the problem:\n\nThe user says: \"Your task is to generate a validation graph using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) based on the description of eligibility requirements for a social benefit. [...] You will receive [...] Text: The social benefit description [...]\"\n\nThe Text provided here is exactly the same as the example's TEXT. So the problem is the same as the example's, so the SHACL should be the same as the example's. However, the example's SHACL uses the shape names like ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape, but the problem may require using different shape names, but SHACL allows any valid names as long as they are unique. However, the example's SHACL is correct, so perhaps the answer is the same.\n\nWait but the user's task says \"the social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph\" and the TEXT provided is the same as the example. Therefore, the correct answer is the SHACL from the example, but maybe with the exact formatting as per the problem's instructions.\n\nLooking at the example's SHACL:\n\nThey have:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ; [ ... ]\n\nThen the shapes: ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape, etc.\n\nThe problem requires that the output is in Turtle, within triple backticks. So the example's SHACL is correct. However, perhaps the user wants to ensure that it's exactly the same, but maybe the example's SHACL is the correct answer here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a solved example to guide, and the problem is actually a different benefit, but the user made a mistake. Wait no, the user's current problem's TEXT is exactly the same as the example's TEXT, so the SHACL should be the same. So the answer is to output the same SHACL as in the example, but perhaps with the exact formatting.\n\nWait but the user might have made a mistake and wants to test if I recognize that. Alternatively, maybe there's a difference. Let me recheck the problem's TEXT.\n\nThe TEXT given here is identical to the example's TEXT. The benefit ID is the same (B100019_LB_582441), the conditions are the same. So the correct SHACL is exactly the one in the example. Therefore, I should output that SHACL as the answer.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance widow's pension\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVWitwenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User's spouse OR civil partner died \n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n    ) .\n\nff:DeceasedPartnerShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n     # The deceased partner had statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Dceased person has statutory accident insurance'\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:InsuranceEventShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Death was caused by an insurance event' or 'User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:InsuranceEventShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Death was caused by an insurance event\n    sh:or (\n            [sh:class ff:WorkAccident]\n            [sh:class ff:CommutingAccident]\n            [sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease]\n     ) ;\n    # User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' benefit. First, I need to parse the requirements from the given text and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nStarting with the user's eligibility conditions. The first point mentions that they must live apart from their parents during training, and the company is too far, or they are at least 18, married, or have a child living with them. The ontology has ff:parentalAdress and ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany as a data property on Adress. So, the user must either have a parental address where the company is too far, or meet one of the age, marital status, or child conditions.\n\nNext, non-German residents: they can get the benefit unless they have an Asylum Act permit or are tolerated with less than 15 months. The ontology has ff:hasAsylumActPermit and ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months. So, the user must not have those, or if they are non-German, those conditions must not apply.\n\nFinancial need: they can't cover living costs, transport, family visits, clothing, childcare. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit and ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds. But maybe the user must not be able to cover these, so need to check the inverse.\n\nTraining eligibility: first vocational training, or if not, can't be integrated otherwise. The ontology has ff:isFirstVocationalTraining. For the non-first case, need a shape with a disability that reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently).\n\nTraining must be recognized under specific laws (CraftsCode, VocationalTrainingAct, NursingProfessionsAct, MaritimeLabourAct). The training must have ff:recognizedByLaw linked to these individuals.\n\nContract requirement: ff:subjectToContract with a VocationalTrainingContract.\n\nFor disabled users, additional cases: training in recognized forms, extension, repetition, etc. The training must have ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to a Disability that has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently.\n\nTraining abroad: for vocational training, part abroad must not exceed 1 year and be appropriate. For full abroad, needs equivalence. The ontology's ff:monthsAbroad and ff:percentAbroad properties could be used. Maybe for part abroad, monthsAbroad <= 12 and percent <= 50%? Or check the data properties' ranges.\n\nAdditional for preparatory measures: commissioned by employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency).\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes. The target is always ff:User. The main shape will have multiple AND constraints.\n\nBreaking down each condition into SHACL constraints:\n\n1. Living situation:\n   - Either (parental address exists and tooFar is true) OR (age >=18 OR marital status is Married/CivilUnion/Widowed/Divorced OR hasChild)\n   This requires using SHACL's OR via OR conditions. But since SHACL Core doesn't have OR, need to use sh:or with separate shapes.\n\n2. Residence conditions for non-Germans:\n   - NOT (hasAsylumActPermit OR (isTolerated AND uninterruptedLegalStay <15 months))\n   Need to check if they are German (ff:isNationalOf Germany) or if they don't have asylum permit and stay duration meets.\n\n3. Financial inability:\n   - NOT (canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit OR canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds)\n   Since they must not be able to cover, so the properties must be false.\n\n4. Training must be first or eligible under disability:\n   - Training has isFirstVocationalTraining OR (has a Disability that reduces prospects AND ...)\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe breaking into multiple shapes with sh:and and sh:or.\n\nAlso, the training must be of type VocationalTraining or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nFor abroad cases, need to check properties like monthsAbroad and percentages.\n\nNeed to ensure that all the conditions are covered without ambiguity. Also, using only SHACL Core components, so no SPARQL.\n\nPutting this all together in Turtle syntax, ensuring each constraint is properly linked. Need to reference the correct ontology terms and structure the shapes correctly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_574724 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe\"@de, \"Vocational Training Allowance\"@en .\n\nff:BerufsausbildungsbeihilfeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unemployed.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n        sh:message \"User must be in vocational training.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                    sh:minIn \"1\"^^xsd:integer ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class ff:Disability ;\n                    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                    sh:qualifiedValueShape [ \n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                            sh:hasValue true \n                        ] \n                    ] \n                ] ]\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Training must be first or due to permanent work integration issues.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingAct, ff:CraftsCode, ff:NursingProfessionsAct, ff:MaritimeLabourAct ;\n                sh:message \"Training must be recognized under applicable laws.\"@en\n            ] ;\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class ff:VocationalTrainingContract \n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                    sh:hasValue true \n                ] ]\n            )\n        ] \n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:parentalAdress ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ;\n                sh:hasValue true \n            ] ] \n            [ sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                    sh:minIn \"18\"^^xsd:int \n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion, ff:Widowed, ff:Divorced \n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 \n                ] ]\n            ) ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasResidenceStatus ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:Germany \n            ] ] \n            [ sh:and (\n                [ sh:not [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ;

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the social benefit 'Ausbildungsgeld' (B100019_LB_574711) based on the given conditions. Let me go through each requirement step by step and see how to translate them into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, the requirements are:\n\n1. The user has a disability (hasDisability is true) and their rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency).\n2. The user is participating in one of the specified measures:\n   - First vocational training,\n   - Vocational preparatory education including basic training,\n   - Individual company qualification within supported employment,\n   - Entry procedure or vocational training area in a workshop for disabled people or another service provider.\n3. The user has no claim to transitional allowance (so they shouldn't be eligible for the transitional allowance benefit, which is B100019_LB_102716305).\n\nStarting with the first condition: hasDisability and rehabilitation provider. \n\nFrom the ontology, the hasDisability data property is on the Person class. So, the user must have ff:hasDisability true. The rehabilitation provider is linked via ff:hasRehabilitationProvider. The provider must be exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency individual (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). So, a SHACL constraint for that would require the user to have a value of that individual on that property, and the hasDisability to be true.\n\nSecond condition: participating in one of the measures. The user must have ff:participates linked to a Training that is one of the listed types. The listed options include \"Entry procedure and vocational training in a workshop...\" which is the ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea class. The others like vocational training (ff:VocationalTraining?), but need to check the ontology for exact classes. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training. The first vocational training could be indicated by the isFirstVocationalTraining data property being true on the Training. Vocational preparatory education might be another subclass, but perhaps the ontology doesn't have an explicit class for that. The problem mentions \"individual company qualification within supported employment\" which might be covered under another subclass, but perhaps we can model it by checking if the training is of a certain type. Alternatively, maybe the key is that the participates must be to a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or another class, but since the exact classes aren't all listed, maybe we can rely on the data properties or other properties. Alternatively, the first part might require that the training is of type VocationalTraining and has isFirstVocationalTraining true. However, the exact mapping might be tricky. Since the example in the problem's example used a hasValue for a specific social benefit, maybe here we can look at the Training's type. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'participates' property's range is Training, and the allowed types include:\n\n- The user's training is an instance of ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or\n- The training is a VocationalTraining and has the property isFirstVocationalTraining = true, \n- etc. \n\nBut since the exact classes for all measures may not be in the ontology, maybe the key is that the participates must be to any Training, but with some conditions. Alternatively, maybe the first condition is covered by the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and the others are covered by other Training subclasses or properties. Since the problem might expect using the available classes, I'll check the ontology again. \n\nLooking at the ontology's Training subclasses, there's VocationalTraining and School, and EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The \"first vocational training\" might be indicated by the isFirstVocationalTraining data property on the Training being true. The \"individual company qualification\" might not have an explicit class, so perhaps the problem expects that any Training is acceptable as long as it's part of the listed options, but since the ontology might not have all, maybe the only explicitly mentioned one is EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and the rest are covered by VocationalTraining with the first being true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'participates' must be to a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or a VocationalTraining where isFirstVocationalTraining is true. \n\nSo, for SHACL, this might require that the user's participates target must have at least one of those conditions. Since SHACL can't do OR in property paths easily, perhaps multiple constraints with different paths. Alternatively, use sh:or. \n\nThird condition: no claim to transitional allowance. The transitional allowance is ff:B100019_LB_102716305. The user must not have an 'isEligibleFor' link to that benefit. So, the user should not have ff:isEligibleFor pointing to that benefit. \n\nNow, structuring this in SHACL:\n\nStart with the NodeShape targeting ff:User.\n\nFirst constraint: hasDisability is true.\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nSecond constraint: hasRehabilitationProvider is exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nThird constraint: participates in a Training that is of the correct type(s). \n\nThis is a bit more complex. The user must have at least one participates link to a Training that is either:\n\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or \n- VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true, or \n- etc. \n\nAssuming that the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is one of the options, and maybe others are covered by other types. But since the problem lists four options and only one is explicitly in the ontology, maybe the rest are considered part of other Training subclasses. Alternatively, perhaps the main point is that the participates must be to any Training, but the shape requires that the Training has the right properties. \n\nAlternatively, since the example used hasValue for a social benefit, perhaps here the Training's type must be one of the listed, so the shape can check for the Training's type. For example:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class [ a sh:ClassConstraint;\n        sh:or ( \n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ];\n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining; sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ]\n        )\n    ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nBut I'm not sure if SHACL allows that syntax. Alternatively, maybe using sh:node which is a NodeShape that enforces the Training to be of certain types or have certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that the participates must be to a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or another specific class, but since others aren't in the ontology, perhaps the example can just check for EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the participates must be to a Training instance, and the Training has to be of certain types. So the constraint would be:\n\nThe user must have at least one participates link where the object is a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea OR (instance of VocationalTraining and isFirstVocationalTraining is true).\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with sh:or in a NodeShape.\n\nSo the participates path must have a value that satisfies one of those conditions.\n\nTherefore, the constraint could be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:node [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nThis way, any Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true is acceptable.\n\nFourth constraint: The user is not eligible for the transitional allowance (B100019_LB_102716305). \n\nThis requires that the user does not have an ff:isEligibleFor link to that benefit. \n\nIn SHACL, this can be a sh:property with sh:disjoints:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor;\n    sh:disjoint ([ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]);\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nAlternatively, using sh:maxCount 0 with sh:hasValue, but disjoint is better here.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe node shape will have four properties: hasDisability, hasRehabilitationProvider, participates, and the disjoint for isEligibleFor.\n\nNow, checking the ontology again for the exact terms. The rehabilitation provider is ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, correct. The transitional allowance is ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (from the first example's SHACL which referenced that as transitional allowance). \n\nAlso, the first condition's hasDisability must be true, so the data property is ff:hasDisability with value true.\n\nAnother thing: The user must have at least one participates link. So the sh:minCount 1 on participates.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle:\n\nStart with the prefix declarations, then the social benefit's definition (though the example includes it, but maybe it's needed here? The problem says to generate the SHACL graph based on the description, so maybe we should include the benefit definition as well. The example included the benefit as an individual.)\n\nSo first:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training allowance\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # hasDisability is true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # has Rehabilitation provider as FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # participates in the required training types\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]  # For the entry procedure part\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n                    ]\n                ]  # For first vocational training\n                # Maybe add other conditions here if needed, but the ontology may not have all\n            )\n        ];\n        sh:message \"Does not meet required participation in training measures.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Not eligible for transitional allowance\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:disjoint ([ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]) ;  # The transitional allowance\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for transitional allowance, conflicting requirement.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the fourth constraint is that the user has no claim to transitional allowance, meaning they should not be eligible for it. The disjoint check here ensures that the user's isEligibleFor does not include that benefit. However, sh:disjoint on the property would mean that the path's values are disjoint with the specified node. Wait, maybe it's better to use sh:maxCount 0 with a sh:hasValue.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with sh:nodeKind sh:IRI and sh:not, but perhaps the simplest is:\n\nThe user must not have an isEligibleFor link to B100019_LB_102716305. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:disjoint ([ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]) ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 0 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValues (\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]\n    );\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nWait, qualifiedMinCount 0 with qualifiedValues would mean that at least 0 of those values are present, but that's not the right approach. \n\nWait, the disjoint approach says that the values of the path must not intersect with the specified set. So using sh:disjoint is correct here. The path's values (the benefits the user is eligible for) must be disjoint with the set containing the transitional allowance. So if the user has that benefit in isEligibleFor, it would violate the constraint.\n\nTherefore, the disjoint approach is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL should look like that. Let me check if all parts are covered.\n\nAnother point: The second condition's other parts like \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" might not be directly represented in the ontology. Since the ontology doesn't have an explicit class for that, maybe the problem expects that we only model the ones present in the ontology (like EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and VocationalTraining with isFirst true). So the SHACL constraints as above should suffice for the given ontology.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include all four constraints as outlined.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit individual\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main NodeShape targeting the User\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # 1.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL validation graph for the unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld) with IDLB B100019_LB_576842. The requirements provided are in German, so I need to parse them accurately and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the requirements carefully. The benefit is granted if the person is unemployed, which has several conditions. Let me break down each requirement:\n\n1. **Arbeitslosigkeit (Unemployment):**\n   - The person is not in an employment relationship, or works less than 15 hours per week.\n   - They must be available for placement efforts by the employment agency (availableForPlacement property).\n\n2. **Registration:**\n   - Registered unemployed electronically with an ID or in person. The registration must be done, which implies the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed.\n   - Also, they need to have submitted the application form, but since SHACL can't check forms directly, maybe this is out of scope. The ontology might not have a property for the form, so perhaps we can ignore this part as per the rules.\n\n3. **Versicherungszeit (Insurance Period):**\n   - Within the last 30 months before unemployment registration, at least 12 months of compulsory insurance. The ontology has ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 which is a boolean indicating this condition.\n\nNow, mapping these to the ontology:\n\n- For unemployment status:\n  - The user's employment status must be ff:RegisteredUnemployed (since they registered).\n  - The employment (if any) must have workHoursPerWeek < 15. But the ontology has ff:inEmployment (boolean) and ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. However, the user is a Person, so maybe they must not be inEmployment or if they are, their employment's workHoursPerWeek < 15.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"not in employment or work less than 15 hours\". So the user can have an employment but only less than 15 hours. But the ontology has ff:inEmployment (boolean) which is true if in any employment. So perhaps the inEmployment must be false, OR if true, their employment's workHoursPerWeek < 15?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, which might already imply being unemployed or working less than 15 hours. Let me check the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:RegisteredUnemployed is an employment status with the comment \"A person has officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\" So the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed. Additionally, the availability for placement (ff:availableForPlacement) must be true.\n\nFor the employment hours: The requirement says either not in employment OR working less than 15 hours. But if the user is registered as unemployed (RegisteredUnemployed), does that already cover that? The ontology's ff:Unemployed status has a comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" So perhaps the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed implies that the user meets the 15-hour condition. However, to be thorough, maybe we should also check that their employment (if any) has workHoursPerWeek <15? But since the employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, maybe that's redundant. Let me see the ontology again:\n\nThe ff:RegisteredUnemployed is a sub-class of EmploymentStatus, but the ff:Unemployed individual has the comment that explicitly mentions the 15-hour rule. So maybe the user's employment status must be either RegisteredUnemployed or Unemployed, but the problem states \"Sie stehen nicht in einem Beschäftigungsverhältnis oder Sie üben nur eine Erwerbstätigkeit in einem Umfang von weniger als 15 Stunden wöchentlich aus und...\" So combining both conditions. Wait, but the first condition is that they are unemployed (arbeitslos sind), which is defined by the employment status. The employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, which includes the 15-hour part. So perhaps the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed is sufficient for the first two parts of the unemployment condition.\n\nThus, the first condition translates to:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus = ff:RegisteredUnemployed\n- AND availableForPlacement is true (since the requirement says \"available for placement efforts\")\n\nNext, the registration part: The user must have registered, so their employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, which might already imply that. So maybe that's covered by the employment status.\n\nThe third condition: compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\n- The user must have employment status RegisteredUnemployed.\n- The user's availableForPlacement must be true.\n- The user's compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true.\n\nNow, looking at the ontology's properties:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus links a Person to an EmploymentStatus. So the user must have exactly one EmploymentStatus which is ff:RegisteredUnemployed.\n\n- The availableForPlacement is a data property of Person (xsd:boolean), so it must be true.\n\n- ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is a data property of Person, also boolean, must be true.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shape.\n\nThe target node is ff:User.\n\nWe need a shape that targets ff:User and has constraints on these properties.\n\nEach condition becomes a sh:property in the shape.\n\nFirst, the employment status:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed;\n]\n\nSecond, availableForPlacement must be true:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n]\n\nThird, compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n]\n\nAdditionally, maybe check that the user is not receiving other conflicting benefits? Wait, the problem statement doesn't mention that. The requirements given are only the listed ones, so perhaps that's all.\n\nWait the original text says \"Sie haben Anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld, wenn...\" followed by the three points. There's no mention of other benefits, so we don't need to include that unless it's implied. The problem says to not model ambiguous requirements, so stick to what's explicit.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape would be named something like ArbeitslosengeldShape, and the target node is ff:User.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ; # Assuming the ID is correct here\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User must have employment status RegisteredUnemployed.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must be available for placement.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have compulsory insurance for at least 12 of the last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first example uses ff:checksFundingRequirement, but that's not in the ontology. Wait the example had a property that's not in the ontology, but maybe that's okay? Wait the ontology's ObjectProperties don't include ff:checksFundingRequirement. So maybe that's a mistake in the example, but since the user says to use only terms from the ontology, perhaps I should avoid that. The example might have been illustrative but the actual ontology doesn't have that property. So perhaps just the node shape without that.\n\nAlso, the user's employment status must have exactly one value (RegisteredUnemployed). So sh:minCount 1 and sh:maxCount 1? Or just sh:minCount 1 since it's required. Since the requirement says \"Sie haben Anspruch wenn...\" which implies that these are necessary conditions, so they must have at least one value. So minCount 1 and hasValue ensures that the only possible value is RegisteredUnemployed. Alternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount with a filter? Wait no, hasValue requires that one of the values is exactly that. Wait, maybe the user must have that as their employment status. So hasValue must be present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the employment status must be exactly RegisteredUnemployed, so:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed;\n    sh:maxCount 1;\n    sh:message \"... must have exactly RegisteredUnemployed employment status.\"@en;\n]\n\nBut maybe the ontology allows multiple employment statuses? Unlikely, since it's a property of a person. Let me check the ontology:\n\nThe domain of ff:hasEmploymentStatus is Person, and the range is EmploymentStatus. Since EmploymentStatus is a class, perhaps each person has exactly one, but the ontology doesn't enforce that. So to ensure that the employment status is exactly RegisteredUnemployed, we can require that the value must be exactly that, and that it's present. So the hasValue and minCount 1 would suffice, assuming that the user can't have multiple employment statuses. But to be safe, maybe adding a maxCount 1 to prevent multiple.\n\nHowever, the problem states to use only SHACL Core components. So, if using sh:hasValue, it checks that at least one of the values is the given one. But perhaps the user must have that as their only employment status. Since the ontology doesn't define cardinality, but the requirement says \"arbeitslos sind\" which is covered by having the correct employment status. So proceed with the hasValue approach.\n\nAlso, the first example used a shape with sh:targetNode ff:User, which is correct here.\n\nSo the final SHACL should be as above, but with the correct ID for the benefit. The benefit's individual is ff:B100019_LB_576842 according to the text.\n\nWait in the problem statement, the TEXT says \"die Sozialleistung 'Arbeitslosengeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_576842\". So the SocialBenefit individual is ff:B100019_LB_576842, which is already in the ontology (see the Individual section):\n\nIndividual: ff:B100019_LB_576842\n    Annotations: rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, rdfs:label \"Unemployment benefit\"@en\n    Types: ff:SocialBenefit \n\nTherefore, the SHACL should reference that individual.\n\nThe shape should be named something like ff:ArbeitslosengeldShape, and the target is ff:User.\n\nI think that covers all the conditions. Let me check again:\n\n1. Employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed (covered by hasEmploymentStatus with hasValue).\n\n2. availableForPlacement must be true (data property).\n\n3. compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true (data property).\n\nYes. The other parts like registration method (electronic or in person) are about the process, not the eligibility criteria's data, so they are out of scope for SHACL which validates the RDF data, not the process steps.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL is as written above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User must have employment status 'RegisteredUnemployed'.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must be available for employment placement.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have compulsory insurance for at least 12 months in last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit described, targeting the \"ff:User\" node. The task is based on the provided ontology and the example given. Let me first parse the requirements from the text.\n\nThe benefit in question is \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\" with IDLB B100019_LB_102717659. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of developing such a disability.\n2. Their rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\n3. Their prospects of participating in the workforce are significantly reduced permanently due to the severity of their disability, necessitating support.\n4. They must be willing to undergo vocational training or similar integration.\n\nLooking at the example provided, it uses SHACL's \"or\" for the disability condition, checks the rehabilitation provider, and ensures the disability's impact. I need to replicate that structure here, making sure to use the correct ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the User must have either a disability type (ff:hasDisabilityType) of VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, or be at risk (ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType). The example uses \"sh:or\" with qualified value shapes. The DisabilityShape in the example checks for the type and severeDisability being true, and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently being true. Since the requirement mentions \"hochgradige\" (severe), I need to include the severeDisability data property set to true. Also, the third condition implies that the disability is the reason for reduced work prospects, so the workforceIntegrationProblemBecause property should point to the disability.\n\nNext, the rehabilitation provider must be exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency. The example uses sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) for the hasRehabilitationProvider property.\n\nThe fourth condition about being willing to undergo training might be a data property, but looking at the ontology, there's ff:participates which links to Training. However, the requirement says \"bereit sein\" (be ready/willing), which might not be directly modeled. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for willingness, perhaps this is inferred if they are participating in a training program. Alternatively, maybe it's implied by other properties like availableForPlacement, but the example didn't include such a condition. Since the user must be \"bereit\", maybe it's captured by being in a training or having some intent, but since the ontology doesn't specify a property for willingness, perhaps this is omitted as per the rule not to invent terms. The example didn't include this either, so maybe it's assumed through other means or considered non-mandatory to model.\n\nWait, the example's last condition in their case was \"Sie sind bereit...\", and they used a property where the user is the inverse of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause. Wait, looking back at the example's SHACL, they have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in ( ff:User ) ;\n]\n\nThis seems to ensure that there exists a Disability where the user is the cause (since the property links Disability to the user). So perhaps the same approach applies here. The user must be linked via the inverse of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause to a Disability that meets the criteria.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape would have:\n\n- OR condition on hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType, each pointing to a DisabilityShape.\n- A property for hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n- The DisabilityShape must check type (Visual/Hearing), severeDisability, reducesWorkProspectsPermanently, and the inverse path to the user via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause.\n\nAdditionally, the User must be participating in training, but if there's no property for willingness, maybe it's not included. The example didn't model the last condition as a participation but perhaps the presence of the disability and need for support implies willingness. Alternatively, the example's last condition was modeled by the inverse path, so maybe here it's similar.\n\nWait, in the example's text, the fourth condition was \"bereit, sich beruflich bilden...\", and they used the inverse path for workforceIntegrationProblemBecause. Perhaps that's how they captured the need for support. The requirement here is similar, so the same approach applies.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL should include those components. Also, the IDLB in the text is B100019_LB_102717659, which is different from the example's B100019_LB_102716305. So the SocialBenefit individual must be correctly named.\n\nLet me structure the Turtle:\n\nFirst, define the SocialBenefit individual with the correct ID.\n\nThen, create a NodeShape targeting ff:User.\n\nThe OR condition for disabilities:\n\nsh:or ( [ hasDisabilityType with DisabilityShape ] [ atRiskOfDisabilityType with DisabilityShape ] )\n\nThe Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nThe DisabilityShape must:\n\n- Have rdf:type of VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment.\n- severeDisability true.\n- reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n- The user is the subject of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause (so inverse path).\n\nAlso, ensure that the Disability is linked to the user via the relevant object properties.\n\nWait, the atRiskOfDisabilityType is a property from Person to Disability, so the OR condition includes both hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType. The DisabilityShape applies to both cases.\n\nThus, the DisabilityShape's constraints ensure that the Disability is of the right type, is severe, and reduces work prospects. Additionally, the user must have that disability (either existing or at risk) as the reason for needing workforce integration help (via the inverse path).\n\nPutting this all into Turtle syntax, ensuring correct prefixes and structure.\n\nAlso, note that the example uses sh:checksFundingRequirement, but that might be specific to their example. Since the task doesn't mention that, perhaps it's not necessary here. The main components are the NodeShape with the constraints.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for correct property names and classes. The example used ff:severeDisability and ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently, which are data properties on Disability. The inverse path for workforceIntegrationProblemBecause: the property ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause has domain Person and range Disability. So the inverse would go from Disability to Person, so the user must be connected via that property. Hence, the inverse path ensures that the Disability is the reason for the user's workforce integration problem.\n\nTherefore, the shape should be correctly structured as in the example, adapted to the given conditions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit node\nff:B100019_LB_102717659 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\"@de, \"Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments\"@en .\n\n# Main validation shape targeting the user\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: Must have/severe visual/hearing disability or be at risk\n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape \n        ]\n        [\n            sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape \n        ]\n    ) ;\n    # Requirement 2: Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 4: Willingness implied through participation in training\n    # (Assumed by presence of disability-related conditions as in example)\n.\n\n# Shape for qualifying disabilities\nff:DisabilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Must be visual or hearing impairment\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must be severe\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must permanently reduce work prospects\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must be the reason for workforce integration needs\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ; # Link back to user\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the Insolvenzgeld benefit based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the benefit ID is B100019_LB_576848, so I'll make sure to include that in the SHACL shapes. The main conditions are:\n\n1. An insolvency event occurred at the employer's side. This can be one of three scenarios:\n   a. Insolvency proceeding opened against the employer's assets.\n   b. Insolvency application rejected due to lack of assets.\n   c. Business discontinued with obvious lack of assets.\n\n2. The user didn't receive wages for up to 3 months before the insolvency event.\n\n3. The user is employed in Germany or temporarily abroad but still under German social security.\n\n4. The user must be legally recognized as an employee, even if they're a partner in a GmbH or similar.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the employer is linked via ff:hasEmployment and ff:employer. The insolvency events are subclasses of ff:Event, so I'll need to check their types. For the wage cut, the ff:wageCutOffsetMonths data property on the event must be between -3 and -1 months. \n\nThe employment status must be ff:Employee. For the country conditions, either countryOfEmployment is Germany or, if abroad, socialSecurityCountry is Germany. \n\nI should structure the SHACL shapes similarly to the example provided. The main shape targets ff:User and includes all the required properties. The insolvency event is checked with an OR of three shapes (A, B, C), each corresponding to one scenario. The wage cut is a shared shape (WageCutShape) to avoid duplication.\n\nI need to ensure all paths are correctly formed using the ontology's properties. Also, messages should be in English as per the example. Let me verify each part step by step to make sure I didn't miss any conditions or use the wrong ontology terms.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: Insolvency event occurred\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:employer) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            ff:EventShapeA\n            ff:EventShapeB\n            ff:EventShapeC\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency event at employer'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 2: Wage cut within 3 months before event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths) ;\n        sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n        sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Wage cut within 3 months before event'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 3: Employment location condition\n    sh:or (\n        ff:GermanyEmploymentShape\n        ff:AbroadEmploymentShape\n    ) ;\n    # Requirement 4: Legal employee status\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:in (ff:Employee) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Legal employee status'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# INSOLVENCY EVENT SUB-SHAPES\nff:EventShapeA a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path (ff:hasEvent rdf:type) ;\n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency proceeding'.\"@en .\n\nff:EventShapeB a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path (ff:hasEvent rdf:type) ;\n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency application'.\"@en .\n\nff:EventShapeC a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path (ff:hasEvent rdf:type) ;\n    sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Business discontinuation'.\"@en .\n\n# EMPLOYMENT LOCATION SHAPES\nff:GermanyEmploymentShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment) ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:AbroadEmploymentShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment) ;\n        sh:not [ sh:in (ff:Germany) ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n```"

examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and wrap it in triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:
