The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and wrap it in triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente' benefit. The user wants me to generate a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility conditions, targeting the \"ff:User\" node. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the requirements from the provided text. The benefit is for surviving dependents of someone who died due to an occupational accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease. The user must be a child, stepchild, foster child, grandchild, or sibling living in the deceased's household and supported by them, or the deceased was mainly contributing to their living expenses. \n\nAdditional conditions apply if the user is between 18 and under 27: they must be in school/vocational training, have a disability preventing self-support, or in a transitional period of up to 4 months between education phases or after military/community service.\n\nNow, mapping these to SHACL constraints using the ontology provided. \n\nStarting with the node shape for ff:User. The target is always ff:User. \n\nFirst condition: The deceased must have died due to an occupational accident (WorkAccident), commuting accident (CommutingAccident), or occupational disease (OccupationalDisease). The user must be linked to the deceased via one of the relationships: natural child, stepchild, foster child, or through living in the same household and being supported. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the deceased is linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or similar? Wait, actually, the deceased is the person who had the event causing their death. The deceased's death event must be of one of those types. So the user should have a relationship to the deceased person, who in turn has a causeOfDeath that is one of the specified event types.\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:causeOfDeath as an object property from Person to Event. So the deceased person (linked via some property to the user) must have a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. But how is the user related to the deceased?\n\nThe user can be a child (ff:hasChild), stepchild (ff:stepChildTo?), foster child (ff:fosterChildTo?), etc. Let me check the ontology's object properties:\n\n- ff:hasChild links a person to their child. So to be a child, the user would be in the range of ff:hasChild from the deceased. But in SHACL, the user is the subject. So perhaps the user must be the child of the deceased (i.e., the deceased has the user as a child via ff:hasChild). Similarly for stepchild: the user is linked via ff:stepChildTo to the deceased. Foster child via ff:fosterChildTo. \n\nWait, looking at the ontology's definitions:\n\n- ff:naturalChildTo links a person to their natural parent. So the user (as natural child) is the child of the deceased, so the user has ff:naturalChildTo pointing to the deceased. Similarly, stepChildTo links a person to their step parent. FosterChildTo links to foster parent. So the user would have those properties pointing to the deceased.\n\nAlternatively, the user is the child, stepchild, or foster child of the deceased, so the user's node must have one of these properties with the deceased as the object. \n\nAdditionally, for grandchildren or siblings living in the same household and supported, it's a bit more complex. The user must be an Enkel (grandchild) or Geschwister (sibling) of the deceased, but how to represent that? The ontology has ff:hasChild and other relations but maybe not directly for grandchildren. Alternatively, perhaps through a chain of relationships, but SHACL doesn't handle that. The text says \"Enkel oder Geschwisterteil\" (grandchild or sibling part?), but the exact ontology terms aren't clear. Since the ontology might not have direct properties for grandchild, perhaps the condition is that the user is in the deceased's household and supported, so maybe the user must be in the household (ff:sameHouseholdAs) and have some support (maybe via ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker being the deceased?), but the exact properties aren't clear. Alternatively, the text mentions \"im Haushalt der verstorbenen Person gelebt haben und dort versorgt und betreut wurden\" which is about living and being cared for there. The ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold which links a CareNeed to a caregiver in the household. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the user is linked via ff:sameHouseholdAs to the deceased, and there's some other condition. But maybe the ontology doesn't have a direct property for \"supported and cared for\". The problem is that the ontology might not have explicit properties for these relationships, so perhaps some parts need to be inferred through existing properties. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the main path is to have the user related via one of the listed relationships (child, stepchild, foster child, grandchild, sibling) and have lived in the household. But given the ontology's structure, perhaps the key is to have the user linked via ff:closeRelative or another property. Wait, looking at the ontology's object properties, there's ff:closeRelative, which links a person to a close relative. But the text specifies more specific relationships. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deceased must be linked via some property to the user, but since SHACL can't traverse that, maybe the user must have a property pointing to the deceased with the correct type. For example, the user has a deceased parent via ff:naturalChildTo, or step parent via ff:stepChildTo, etc. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a deceased parent, step-parent, foster parent, or be a grandchild/sibling who lived in the same household. Since the exact properties for grandchild or sibling aren't clear, maybe the problem expects to model only the first part (child, stepchild, foster child) and the household condition. Alternatively, the example might ignore some parts due to ontology limitations.\n\nAnother point: the deceased must have died due to one of the specified events. So the deceased's causeOfDeath must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nSo, the SHACL shape should enforce that the user is linked to the deceased via one of the allowed relationships (child, stepchild, foster child, grandchild, sibling) or that the deceased was their main caregiver. But given the ontology's properties, perhaps:\n\n- The user must have a deceased parent (ff:naturalChildTo points to the deceased), or step parent (ff:stepChildTo), or foster parent (ff:fosterChildTo), OR \n\n- The user is a grandchild or sibling who lived in the deceased's household and was supported there. \n\nBut without explicit properties for grandchild or sibling in the ontology, maybe the condition is covered by being a close relative (ff:closeRelative) with household presence (ff:sameHouseholdAs). Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to focus on the first part (children) and the household condition. Alternatively, maybe the examples aren't provided, so I have to proceed with what's possible.\n\nNext, the user must be between 18 and under 27 years old (so ff:hasAge must be >=18 and <27). Additionally, one of the following must hold:\n\n- In education/training (ff:participates in School or VocationalTraining?), \n\n- Cannot support self due to disability (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause links to a Disability that reduces work prospects permanently),\n\n- In a transitional period (ff:isInTransitionalPeriod is true).\n\nWait, the transitional period is covered by ff:isInTransitionalPeriod data property, which is true if in a transitional period of <=4 calendar months. \n\nNow, putting this into SHACL shapes:\n\nThe main shape for the User must have:\n\n- A path to the deceased's causeOfDeath being one of the three event types. Wait, but how to link the user to the deceased's causeOfDeath? Since the user is related to the deceased via one of the properties (child, etc.), the deceased's causeOfDeath must be one of those events. But in SHACL, you can't traverse through another node's properties unless it's in the same graph. The user's data would need to have the deceased's event linked somehow. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's RDF data includes the deceased person (as an individual) and their causeOfDeath. So the user's data might have something like:\n\n:User ff:deceasedSpouse [ a ff:Person ; ff:causeOfDeath [ a ff:WorkAccident ] ] .\n\nBut how to express that the user must have such a relationship via one of the allowed familial links. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a deceased parent (ff:naturalChildTo pointing to the deceased), and that deceased has a causeOfDeath of the required type. \n\nThis is getting complex because SHACL can't directly express constraints on related nodes unless they are explicitly referenced. Since the SHACL must validate the user's data, perhaps the user's data includes the deceased as an individual and their causeOfDeath. So in SHACL terms:\n\nThe user must have a deceased parent via one of the relationships (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo), and that deceased's causeOfDeath is one of the event types. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would require that the user has at least one of the following properties (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo, or some other for grandchild/sibling), and the object of that property must have a causeOfDeath that is a member of the allowed events. \n\nBut SHACL's sh:property can't directly traverse two hops (user -> deceased -> causeOfDeath). However, SHACL allows for nested constraints. \n\nWait, SHACL has sh:path that can be a path expression. So maybe:\n\nFor the user to have a child (natural) to someone (deceased) who has a causeOfDeath of the correct type. \n\nSo:\n\nThe user must have at least one of the following relationships (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo) pointing to a deceased person whose causeOfDeath is one of the required events. \n\nBut how to express that the target of the relationship (the deceased) has a causeOfDeath of type WorkAccident, etc.?\n\nThis requires a property path in SHACL. For example:\n\nThe user must have a naturalChildTo where the target has a causeOfDeath that is a member of the allowed events. \n\nBut in SHACL, you can use the path with a path expression. \n\nFor example:\n\nsh:path [ \n  sh:inversePath ff:naturalChildTo ; \n  sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ; \n  sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) \n]\n\nWait, but inversePath might not be straightforward. Alternatively, the path would be:\n\nThe path for the user's naturalChildTo, then their causeOfDeath. But SHACL allows path expressions like:\n\nsh:path ?deceasedPerson ff:causeOfDeath\n\nBut maybe I need to structure the shape as a nested property. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a deceased parent (via naturalChildTo), and that deceased has a causeOfDeath of the required type. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's data includes the deceased's event directly, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the detailed family relationship and focus on the conditions that can be directly checked via data properties. Wait, no, the main condition is the relationship to the deceased and the cause of death. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SHACL needs to ensure that the user has a deceased parent (via one of the relationships), and that the deceased's causeOfDeath is one of those events. \n\nBut in SHACL, since you can't traverse to the deceased's properties unless they are in the user's data, perhaps the user must have a property like ff:deceasedParent or similar. Looking at the ontology, the user can have a ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner, but those are for spouses. Wait, the deceased here is a parent (or other relative), so maybe the user has a deceased parent via ff:hasChild in reverse. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ontology has no direct way to express the deceased parent, so the problem might require using the ff:causeOfDeath via another path. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the main conditions:\n\n1. User must be a child (natural, step, foster) or grandchild/sibling living in household and supported, or the deceased was their main caregiver.\n\n2. Deceased died due to WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\n3. If between 18-27, must be in training, cannot support due to disability, or in transitional period.\n\nStarting with the first part: relationships to the deceased.\n\nAssuming the user's data includes the deceased as a person linked via one of the relationships. For example:\n\nUser ff:naturalChildTo [ a ff:Person ; ff:causeOfDeath ... ]\n\nTo model that the user has a naturalChildTo relationship to someone whose causeOfDeath is one of the allowed events.\n\nIn SHACL, for the user to have at least one of the following:\n\nEither:\n\n- ff:naturalChildTo points to someone with causeOfDeath in the allowed events,\n\nOR\n\n- ff:stepChildTo points to someone with causeOfDeath in allowed events,\n\nOR\n\n- ff:fosterChildTo points to someone with causeOfDeath in allowed events,\n\nOR\n\n- (for grandchild/sibling: need to see how that's represented, but perhaps via ff:closeRelative and sameHouseholdAs?)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects to focus only on the first three relationships (child, stepchild, foster child), as those are explicit in the ontology.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have a sh:or constraint where one of these relationships exists, and the target has the correct causeOfDeath.\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL?\n\nPerhaps using a sh:property for each possible relationship (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo), and for each, a nested constraint on the target's causeOfDeath.\n\nAlternatively, use a sh:property with a path that includes the relationship and the causeOfDeath, then check if any of those paths exists.\n\nWait, here's an approach using sh:or:\n\nThe shape for the user requires that there exists at least one of the following:\n\nEither:\n\n- (has naturalChildTo to a person whose causeOfDeath is one of the allowed events)\n\nOR\n\n- (has stepChildTo ... etc.)\n\nSo each of these would be a separate sh:property with a path and a constraint.\n\nFor example, for naturalChildTo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ;\n  sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n  sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nBut then the user must have at least one such path. So the overall constraint would be a sh:or of multiple such properties.\n\nWait, but the path ff:naturalChildTo/ff:causeOfDeath would require that the user has a naturalChildTo link to a person who has a causeOfDeath of one of those types. So the user must have such a parent, and that parent's causeOfDeath is correct.\n\nSo the shape would have a sh:or with three components (natural, step, foster), each requiring their path.\n\nThen, for the other cases (grandchild, sibling in household), perhaps another sh:property that requires ff:closeRelative and sameHouseholdAs, but I'm not sure. Since the ontology might not have explicit properties for that, maybe the problem expects to omit those conditions due to ambiguity or ontology limitations. The user instructions say not to model ambiguous requirements. Since the ontology doesn't have direct properties for grandchild or sibling's household condition, perhaps those are considered ambiguous and excluded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have ff:sameHouseholdAs the deceased and be a close relative (ff:closeRelative). But again, without explicit data, it's hard to model. Given the strict instructions, perhaps only the first three relationships are modeled.\n\nNext, the age condition between 18-27: \n\nThe user's age (ff:hasAge) must be between 18 and 26 (since under 27). \n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n  sh:minInclusive 18 ;\n  sh:maxExclusive 27\n]\n\nBut only if they are in that age range, then they need one of the three conditions (training, disability, transitional period).\n\nWait, the age condition is only relevant if they are between 18 and 27. So the overall structure is:\n\nEither the user is under 18, or between 18-27 and satisfies one of the three conditions.\n\nSo in SHACL terms, this can be expressed with a sh:or where one branch is \"hasAge < 18\" or (hasAge between 18-27 AND (training OR disability OR transitional)).\n\nBut how to structure this?\n\nAlternatively, the requirement is that if the user is between 18 and under 27, then they must meet one of the three conditions. So the condition is:\n\n(age < 18 OR (age >=18 AND age <27 AND (training OR disability OR transitional)))\n\nBut SHACL can model this with a sh:or and sh:and.\n\nAlternatively, the shape could have:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n  [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ] ], \n\n  [ \n    sh:and ( \n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ; sh:maxExclusive 27 ] ], \n      [ sh:or ( \n        trainingCondition, \n        disabilityCondition, \n        transitionalCondition \n      ) ] \n    ) \n  ] \n\n)\n\nNow, each of those conditions:\n\nTraining: participates in a School or VocationalTraining (since the user is in Schul- oder Berufsausbildung). Looking at the ontology, School and VocationalTraining are subclasses of Training. So ff:participates should point to an instance of either of those classes.\n\nSo:\n\ntrainingCondition is a sh:class constraint:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:class [ \n    sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) \n  ] ;\n  sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nDisability condition: cannot support self due to disability. The user has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a Disability that has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as true.\n\nWait, the text says \"because of a disability they cannot support themselves\". The ontology has ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause which points to a Disability. \n\nWait, looking back at the ontology:\n\n- ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause points to Disability as the reason needing workforce integration support.\n\n- ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause also points to Disability as the reason they can't support themselves.\n\nThe text says \"kann wegen Behinderung nicht selbst für Unterhalt aufkommen\" which translates to cannot support because of disability. The ontology has ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause for that purpose.\n\nSo the user must have a ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause link to a Disability. Additionally, that disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must be true?\n\nWait the text says \"because of a physical, mental or psychological disability cannot support themselves\". The ontology's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is a data property of Disability, indicating if it reduces work prospects permanently. So the disability must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nTherefore, the condition is:\n\nUser has a ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause pointing to a Disability with ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nIn SHACL, this would be a nested constraint:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n      sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nTransitional period condition: ff:isInTransitionalPeriod must be true.\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ;\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, also note that the user must be eligible even if they are in one of these conditions, so the overall structure requires the causeOfDeath condition, the relationship, and the age-related conditions.\n\nWait, no, the main conditions are:\n\n1. Relationship to deceased via one of the allowed types (child, step, foster, etc.) and deceased's causeOfDeath is correct.\n\n2. Age and the other conditions if applicable.\n\nThe SHACL shape must combine all these.\n\nSo the overall shape for the user is:\n\nA shape with targetClass ff:User, and constraints:\n\n- Must have one of the relationships (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo) to a person whose causeOfDeath is one of the allowed events. \n\n- Plus the age-related conditions.\n\nAdditionally, there's the part about the deceased being the main caregiver (overwiegend für Lebensunterhalt aufgekommen). But how to model that?\n\nThe text says \"die verstorbene Person überwiegend für Ihren Lebensunterhalt aufgekommen ist.\" \n\nThe ontology has ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker which links a person to the main provider of their living expenses. So the user's ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker should be the deceased. \n\nBut how to link that to the deceased's causeOfDeath? \n\nThis complicates things further. The user must have their primary care taker as the deceased (who is now deceased), and that deceased's causeOfDeath is correct. \n\nAlternatively, the user has ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker pointing to the deceased, who in turn has the causeOfDeath.\n\nSo the path for the primary care taker's causeOfDeath would be:\n\nff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath \n\nThis adds another possible path for eligibility.\n\nThus, the user can be eligible via either:\n\n- Being a child, stepchild, foster child of the deceased (with the causeOfDeath condition), \n\nOR \n\n- Being someone whose primary caregiver was the deceased (with the causeOfDeath condition and the caregiver relationship).\n\nAdditionally, the part about living in the household and being supported (for grandchild/siblings) might be covered by the primary caregiver condition.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the main parts that are directly representable with the ontology.\n\nThe SHACL shape will thus have:\n\n- A sh:or constraint that includes:\n\n   - For each of the child relationships (natural, step, foster), a path to the deceased's causeOfDeath being correct.\n\n   - For the primary caregiver condition, a path to the primary caregiver's causeOfDeath being correct.\n\nAdditionally, the age and other conditions.\n\nSo the shape will have multiple sh:property elements under sh:or for the relationships.\n\nPutting this all together in Turtle:\n\nStart with the @prefixes, then define a shape with targetNode ff:User.\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- Constraints for the relationships leading to the correct causeOfDeath.\n\n- Constraints for the age and the three conditions.\n\nThe final SHACL graph would look something like this:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n\n:ShapeWaisenrente a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Check relationship and cause of death\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:path ( ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ; sh:minCount 1 ] .\n      [ sh:path ( ff:stepChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ; sh:minCount 1 ] .\n      [ sh:path ( ff:fosterChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ; sh:minCount 1 ] .\n      [ sh:path ( ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n    ) \n  ] ;\n  \n  sh:property [\n    # Age condition and subsequent conditions if applicable\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ] .\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ; sh:maxExclusive 27 ] .\n          [\n            sh:or (\n              # In training\n              [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] ; sh:minCount 1 ] .\n              # Disability condition\n              [\n                sh:path ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:node [\n                  sh:property [ sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ; sh:hasValue true ]\n                ]\n              ] .\n              # Transitional period\n              [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ]\n            )\n          ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ] .\n\nWait, but the SHACL syntax in Turtle uses semicolons and periods correctly. Also, the nested sh:or and sh:and need proper brackets.\n\nLet me structure it correctly:\n\nEach sh:property element under the main shape is for a separate condition.\n\nFirst, the relationship and causeOfDeath:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ... ) \n  ...\n]\n\nWait, the first sh:property is for the relationship and causeOfDeath, which is an or of four paths.\n\nThen the second sh:property is for the age and other conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the first condition is that the user must have at least one of the relationship paths, and also satisfy the age conditions.\n\nWait, in SHACL, all the properties in a NodeShape are ANDed together. So the user must satisfy all the properties listed.\n\nThus, the shape has two sh:property elements:\n\n1. The relationship and causeOfDeath condition (as an or of four paths)\n\n2. The age and other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL would look like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n\n:ShapeWaisenrente a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  # Condition 1: Relationship and causeOfDeath\n  sh:property [\n    sh:predicate ff:naturalChildTo ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] , [\n    sh:predicate ff:stepChildTo ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] , [\n    sh:predicate ff:fosterChildTo ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] , [\n    sh:predicate ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  \n  # OR condition: The user must have at least one of the above relationships\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:path ff:naturalChildTo ; sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ; sh:qualifiedValueShape ... ] \n    ... \n  )\n\nWait, perhaps the qualified approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:or with each path:\n\nWait maybe the first approach is better with sh:or and path expressions.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or for the four conditions (naturalChildTo etc.), each requiring their path.\n\nSo the first property is an OR of the four paths leading to correct causeOfDeath.\n\nThen the second property is the age condition.\n\nSo the final code:\n\n:ShapeWaisenrente a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  # Check that at least one relationship exists leading to correct causeOfDeath\n  sh:property [\n    sh:or (\n      # Natural Child path\n      [ sh:path ( ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; \n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n      ]\n      # Step Child path\n      [ sh:path ( ff:stepChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; \n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n      ]\n      # Foster Child path\n      [ sh:path ( ff:fosterChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; \n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n      ]\n      # Primary Care Taker path\n      [ sh:path ( ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath ) ; \n        sh:oneOf ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Age and conditions if applicable\n  sh:property [\n    sh:or (\n      # User is under 18\n      [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:maxExclusive 18 ]\n      # Or between 18-27 and meets one of the conditions\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive 18 ; sh:maxExclusive 27 ]\n          [\n            sh:or (\n              # In training\n              [ sh:path ff:participates ; \n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] ; \n                sh:minCount 1 \n              ]\n              # Disability condition\n              [\n                sh:path ff:cannotSupportThemselvesBecause ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:node [\n                  sh:property [ \n                    sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ; \n                    sh:hasValue true \n                  ]\n                ]\n              ]\n              # Transitional period\n              [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ]\n            )\n          ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ] .\n\nThis should cover the requirements.

Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text provided.\n\nFirst, the main conditions listed are:\n\n1. The user must have been receiving \"Bürgergeld\" (Citizen benefit) before starting the new activity. Unemployment isn't a requirement here.\n2. The application must be submitted to the Jobcenter before starting the new employment.\n3. The new self-employment or employment must be suitable to help overcome their need for assistance in the long term.\n4. The 'Einstiegsgeld' is necessary for integration into the general labor market.\n5. The employment must involve at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditionally, for self-employment or starting a business, there are extra requirements:\n- Positive evaluation by the Jobcenter regarding personal suitability and the economic viability of the self-employment.\n\nNow, looking at the ontology provided, I need to map these conditions to the available classes, properties, and individuals.\n\nStarting with the first condition: receiving Bürgergeld before the new activity. The Bürgergeld is represented by the individual ff:B100019_LB_106311931. The user must have this benefit. The property to use here would be ff:receivesBenefit. However, the condition specifies that they received it before starting the new activity. But since SHACL is about current data, maybe it's checking if they currently receive it? Wait, the text says \"vor Aufnahme der neuen Tätigkeit\" which means before starting the new activity. Since the SHACL is validating current data, perhaps it's sufficient that they are currently receiving it, assuming the application is before starting. Alternatively, maybe there's a property like receivedWithinLast3Years? But the ontology has ff:receivedBenefit which links to a past benefit. Hmm. Wait, the ontology has ff:receivesBenefit for current benefits and ff:receivedBenefit for past. Since the user needs to have been receiving it before starting the new job, maybe the current receivesBenefit would include that, but I need to ensure that they still do. Or perhaps the application is made before starting, so they might still be receiving it. So the SHACL constraint would require that the user has ff:receivesBenefit with ff:B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nSecond condition: application submitted before starting the activity. But how to model that in SHACL? Since it's about the timing of the application relative to starting work, but SHACL can't handle temporal data unless there's a property that captures the application date. The ontology doesn't have such a property. The user's data might include an application date via some property, but the ontology doesn't mention it. Since the ontology doesn't have that, this condition might be ambiguous and thus we can't model it. The problem states not to model ambiguous requirements. So maybe skip this condition as it can't be assessed with the given ontology.\n\nThird condition: the new activity must be suitable to overcome help need. The ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause pointing to a disability, but not sure. Maybe this is about the purpose of the training or employment. Since the ontology includes ff:participates for training, but the condition is about the activity's suitability. Perhaps the training needs to be commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency being true). The ontology has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency as a data property on Training. So if the user is participating in a training commissioned by the employment agency, that might satisfy the suitability. But the condition is about employment or self-employment, not necessarily training. Hmm, maybe this is not directly mappable. Alternatively, maybe the user must be in an employment with certain properties. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus which could be relevant, but not sure. Since the exact property isn't clear, maybe this condition is too vague and can't be modeled. Wait, the example included a constraint on receiving a benefit. Maybe the main condition is that the user must have the new employment, which has a workHoursPerWeek of at least 15.\n\nFourth condition: Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration. This seems similar to the third point and might be covered by the same constraints.\n\nFifth condition: employment must be at least 15 hours per week. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. So the user's Employment must have workHoursPerWeek ≥ 15.\n\nFor the additional conditions for self-employment:\n\n- Positive evaluation by Jobcenter regarding personal suitability and economic viability. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus, but not sure. The evaluation might be part of a property like ff:triggeringEvent or something else. Alternatively, there might be a data property indicating approval. Since the ontology doesn't have a property for this evaluation, this might also be ambiguous. So perhaps those conditions can't be modeled and should be excluded.\n\nNow, putting together the constraints:\n\n- The user must have receivesBenefit with ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n- The user must have an Employment (or SelfEmployed status?) with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Since the condition mentions \"Erwerbstätigkeit\" which can be employment or self-employment, but the ontology's ff:Employment is for employment, maybe the user has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Alternatively, if self-employment is considered, maybe the employment status is SelfEmployed (ff:SelfEmployed), but the hours would still need to be checked. However, the ontology's ff:workHoursPerWeek is on Employment, not on SelfEmployed. So perhaps the constraint is on ff:Employment's workHoursPerWeek.\n\nWait, the fifth condition says \"Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche\" – their employment activity must include at least 15 hours per week. So the user must have an Employment (or equivalent) with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. So the shape should require that the user has an Employment linked via ff:hasEmployment, and that Employment has workHoursPerWeek ≥15.\n\nAlso, the user must be in an employment status that allows this. Maybe the employment status is JobSeeker or something else, but not sure. Since the first condition allows receiving Bürgergeld without unemployment, maybe the user can be in any employment status except employed? Not sure, but the main point is the hours.\n\nAdditionally, the application must be submitted before starting the activity. Since that's temporal and not covered in the ontology, skip it.\n\nNow, for the SHACL shapes:\n\nTarget node is ff:User. The shape will check:\n\n1. ff:receivesBenefit must include ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n\nBut SHACL requires that the user has at least one such value. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, but maybe the user could have multiple benefits, so the shape needs to ensure that at least one of them is Bürgergeld. Alternatively, that the Bürgergeld is among the benefits they receive. So the hasValue is correct.\n\nSecond constraint: the user has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ff:Employment;  # Maybe redundant but ensures it's Employment type\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n    ];\n]\n\nWait, but the user must have an Employment (maybe via hasEmployment) that has workHoursPerWeek >=15. So the path is ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek. But in SHACL, to express that for each Employment linked via hasEmployment, the workHoursPerWeek is >=15, but the condition requires that at least one Employment exists with that. Wait, actually the user must have at least one Employment where workHoursPerWeek is ≥15. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n            sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n        ];\n    ];\n]\n\nAlternatively, the path is ff:hasEmployment, and then within that, the workHoursPerWeek must be at least 15. So using qualified constraints.\n\nPutting this together.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the user must be in a certain employment status. The condition says \"Arbeitslosigkeit ist keine Voraussetzung\", so unemployment isn't required. So the user might be registered unemployed but that's not required. So perhaps no constraint on employment status, except the hours.\n\nAlso, the 'Einstiegsgeld' is the benefit we're validating eligibility for, so the shape should be linked to that benefit's ID.\n\nThe example provided in the problem includes a shape for the benefit and a node shape for the User. Following the example's structure:\n\nThe SHACL would have a node shape for the benefit, then a shape targeting ff:User with the constraints.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, declare the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:EinstiegsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Bürgergeld constraint\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n        sh:message \"User does not receive Bürgergeld\"@en;\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        # Employment with >=15 hours\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n                sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n                sh:message \"Employment does not meet minimum 15 hours/week\"@en;\n            ];\n        ];\n    ];\n    # Maybe other constraints?\n    # The part about the Jobcenter evaluation is not possible\n    # The necessity for integration might be covered by the employment's purpose, but not modeled\n    # The 'positive evaluation' can't be modeled without a property\n    # So those are omitted\n.\n\nWait, but the first condition says they must have been receiving Bürgergeld before starting the new activity. Since SHACL is about current data, maybe they still are receiving it when applying. So the constraint is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the new activity is either self-employment or employment. The ontology has ff:SelfEmployed as an employment status. So maybe the user's employment status must be SelfEmployed or something else? The condition says \"Selbstständigkeit oder neue Beschäftigung\", so either self-employment or new employment. The employment status would be SelfEmployed or perhaps Employee? But the exact status isn't specified, so perhaps the employment type isn't necessary as long as the work hours are met.\n\nSo the current constraints should be sufficient. The other conditions that can't be modeled are omitted as per the problem's rules.\n\nThus, the final SHACL would include these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main validation shape for the User node\nff:EinstiegsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must currently receive Bürgergeld\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives Bürgergeld.'\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Employment must have at least 15 hours/week\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                sh:message \"Employment does not meet minimum 15 hours/week requirement.\"@en ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the 'Kindergeld' social benefit based on the given conditions. Let's start by understanding the requirements for the parents and the child.\n\nFirst, the parents must be in Germany with unlimited income tax liability or be taxed as such. This applies to EU, EEA, or Swiss nationals. They don't need a domestic residence. For EU/EEA citizens moving after August 2019, after four months, they must meet the Free Movement Act conditions. That includes being self-employed, employed, job-seeking, or involuntarily unemployed; deriving freedom from a family member; having sufficient means and health insurance; or having permanent residency. \n\nFor non-EU/EWR/Swiss parents, they need a residence permit allowing work or be a recognized refugee/asylee.\n\nThe child must have residence in Germany or another EU/EEA/Swiss country. Also, if the child is in the EU/EEA/Switzerland, but a parent has unlimited tax liability in Germany, that's acceptable.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the User is a Person. The SHACL must target ff:User. \n\nFirst, for the parents' tax liability. The ontology has ff:incomeTaxLiability with range ff:TaxLiabilityScope. The required value is UnlimitedTaxLiability (ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability). So a constraint for that property must have sh:hasValue.\n\nNext, for EU/EWR/Swiss nationality: ff:isNationalOf must link to a Country that is a subclass of EEAplusCH (since EEA+CH includes EU/EEA/Switzerland). So using sh:class with sh:nodeKind sh:Class and sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH. \n\nBut there's also a condition for non-EU citizens. They must have a residence permit allowing work (ff:entitlesToEmployment true) or be recognized refugee/asylee (ff:recognizedRefugee true or ff:entitledToAsylum true). Since the user can be in either category, we need sh:or. \n\nThe four-month rule for EU/EEA citizens after moving: The move event (ff:MoveToGermany) must have a date (ff:hasDate) such that the time from that date to now is more than four months? Wait, the condition says after the 4th month post-entry, so if they moved less than four months ago, maybe another condition applies. Wait the problem says \"ab dem 4. Monat ab Einreise müssen die Voraussetzungen des Freizügigkeitsgesetzes erfüllt sein.\" So if they moved after August 2019, then after four months, they must meet the free movement conditions. But how to model this? The user must have either moved more than four months ago or meets the free movement conditions. Hmm, perhaps this is tricky. But maybe the main point is that if they are EU/EEA, they must meet the free movement conditions after four months. Since we can't track time dynamically, maybe the SHACL can't enforce the timeline unless the move date is provided. Since SHACL is static, perhaps we can't check the exact duration, so maybe the condition is that they have the required attributes regardless. Maybe the four-month part is a timing condition that can't be captured without date info, so perhaps we model the free movement conditions as a must-have if they are EU/EEA.\n\nThe free movement conditions include being employed, job-seeking, etc. Let's see: \n\nThe user must have one of the following:\n\n- EmploymentStatus: ff:Employee, ff:SelfEmployed (since \"selbständig oder unselbständig erwerbstätig\" – self-employed or employed)\n- ff:JobSeeker (arbeitsuchend) or ff:Unemployed (unfreiwillig arbeitslos)\n- derive freedom from a close relative (ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists)\n- has adequate health insurance (ff:adequateHealthInsurance true)\n- has permanent residency (ff:permanentRightOfResidence true)\n\nThese are OR conditions. So for EU/EEA citizens, they must have at least one of these.\n\nThis might require a SHACL shape with sh:or for each of these conditions.\n\nAlso, for the residence permit part, if they are not EU, they must have either a residence permit that entitles to employment (ff:entitlesToEmployment true) or be a refugee/asylee.\n\nNow for the child's conditions:\n\nThe child must have residence in Germany or another EU/EEA/Swiss country. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence, which for the child must be a subclass of EEAplusCH or Germany. But since Germany is a subclass of Country, perhaps the country is either Germany or in EEAplusCH. So for the child's countryOfResidence, the value must be a Country that is a member of EEAplusCH or exactly Germany. Wait, but Germany is part of EEAplusCH? The ontology says EEAplusCH is EU/EEA and Switzerland. Germany is part of EU, so yes. So the country just needs to be a subclass of EEAplusCH. Wait, the ontology says EEAplusCH is a subclass of Country. So the countryOfResidence must be an instance of EEAplusCH or Germany (but Germany is part of EEAplusCH). So the child's countryOfResidence must be a Country that is an instance of EEAplusCH.\n\nAlternatively, the country must be in EEAplusCH or Germany? No, since Germany is in EEAplusCH. So the countryOfResidence should be a Country that is a subclass of EEAplusCH.\n\nAdditionally, even if the child is in another EU country, if a parent has unlimited tax liability in Germany, then it's okay. So the parent's tax liability must be unlimited, and the child's residence can be elsewhere in EU/EEA/Switzerland.\n\nWait, the child's residence can be in any of those, but the parent must have the tax liability in Germany. So the parent's ff:incomeTaxLiability must be ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability. So the parent's condition is already covered in the first part.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape for ff:User must have constraints:\n\n1. Must have ff:incomeTaxLiability with value ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability, OR\n\n   (if EU citizen):\n\n   a) ff:isNationalOf is a Country in EEAplusCH, AND\n\n      (must have moved more than four months ago? Not sure how to model, so perhaps assume that if they are in EEAplusCH, they meet the free movement conditions, which requires:\n\n      They must have at least one of:\n\n      - EmploymentStatus is Employee, SelfEmployed, JobSeeker, Unemployed\n\n      - derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists (has someone they derive it from)\n\n      - adequateHealthInsurance is true\n\n      - permanentRightOfResidence is true\n\n   OR\n\n   b) For non-EU: has residence permit that entitles to work, or is refugee/asylee.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's structure the SHACL step by step.\n\nThe main shape for User must have:\n\n- Either:\n\n   - The user's incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability (covers first condition)\n\nOR\n\n   - (User is EU/EEA/Swiss national and meets Free Movement conditions) OR (non-EU with valid permit/refugee)\n\nWait, the first bullet says for parents (user) being EU/EEA/Swiss, they must have unlimited tax liability OR be taxed as such. So perhaps the first part is already covered by the first condition (incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability). The second bullet adds that for EU citizens moving after Aug 2019, after four months they must meet the Free Movement conditions. Since SHACL can't track dates, maybe this is considered as part of the Free Movement conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the first condition (unlimited tax liability) covers the general case, but EU/EEA citizens may also qualify under the Free Movement Act conditions even if their tax liability isn't unlimited? Not sure. The problem says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz. Ein inländischer Wohnsitz ist nicht zwingend erforderlich.\"\n\nSo for EU citizens, they must be taxed as unlimited, but the tax liability can be in Germany even without a residence. So the first condition applies to them. But for those moving after 2019, after four months, they must also meet Free Movement conditions. Since we can't check the move date, perhaps the Free Movement conditions are additional constraints for EU citizens. So:\n\nIf user is in EU/EEA/Swiss (ff:isNationalOf a EEAplusCH), then they must have either:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability (which is required anyway?), \n\nAND also meet the Free Movement conditions (since after four months, they must meet those). Wait, the problem says \"ab dem 4. Monat... müssen die Voraussetzungen des Freizügigkeitsgesetzes erfüllt sein\". So perhaps after four months, the tax condition is not enough, so the user must also meet the Free Movement conditions. But how to model that without the move date?\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the problem expects to ignore the timeline and just require the Free Movement conditions for EU citizens. Alternatively, perhaps the first part covers the tax condition, and the EU citizens must also meet the Free Movement conditions (since they are part of the requirements after four months). So perhaps:\n\nThe user must satisfy one of the following:\n\n1. The user's incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability (covers the first case)\n\nOR\n\n2. (User is EU/EEA/Swiss and meets Free Movement conditions) OR (non-EU with valid permit/refugee)\n\nWait, but the first case already includes EU citizens. Maybe the first condition is for all users except those who are non-EU but qualify under other terms.\n\nAlternatively, the structure is:\n\nThe user must meet either:\n\na) They are a citizen of EU/EEA/Switzerland, and have unlimited tax liability, and also meet the Free Movement conditions (since after four months, they must meet those), OR\n\nb) They are a non-EU citizen with valid residence permit or refugee status.\n\nHmm, perhaps the SHACL needs to have:\n\nThe user must have ff:incomeTaxLiability of UnlimitedTaxLiability, OR\n\n(If they are an EU citizen, they must also meet Free Movement conditions) AND have the tax liability?\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe the problem expects to model the conditions as:\n\nThe user must have:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability, OR\n\n- (isNationalOf is a EEAplusCH and meets Free Movement conditions) OR \n\n- (is not EU and has residence permit entitles to work OR is refugee/asylee).\n\nBut also, the user must be either EU citizen (meeting their conditions) or non-EU (meeting theirs).\n\nAlternatively, the first condition (unlimited tax liability) is sufficient, but for EU citizens, they also need to meet the Free Movement conditions if they moved after a certain time. Since we can't track that, perhaps the Free Movement conditions are required for EU citizens.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may require that the user has incomeTaxLiability of UnlimitedTaxLiability, OR (for EU citizens, they have Free Movement conditions met AND are in EEAplusCH).\n\nWait, the problem says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz. Ein inländischer Wohnsitz ist nicht zwingend erforderlich.\"\n\nSo EU citizens are included in the first condition. So the first condition is satisfied if they are taxed as unlimited. But for those moving after 2019, after four months they need to also meet Free Movement conditions. Since SHACL can't track time, maybe the Free Movement conditions are mandatory for EU citizens in addition to the tax condition. Or perhaps the tax condition is sufficient, but the Free Movement conditions are for other cases where tax isn't unlimited? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first condition is for tax, and the second part is additional requirements for EU citizens after moving. Since the problem states that for EU citizens moving after 2019, after four months they must meet Free Movement conditions. Since the SHACL can't enforce the time aspect, perhaps the Free Movement conditions are required for EU citizens, regardless.\n\nMaybe the approach is:\n\nThe user must:\n\n1. Have incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability\n\nOR\n\n2. (isNationalOf in EEAplusCH AND meets Free Movement conditions)\n\nOR\n\n3. (is not EU/EEA/Swiss AND has valid residence permit OR is refugee/asylee)\n\nWait, but the first condition includes EU citizens. So perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe user must have:\n\nEither:\n\n- ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability, OR\n\n- (if EU citizen, they must meet Free Movement conditions) AND have the tax liability? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem's first bullet applies to all, but for EU citizens, they also must meet Free Movement conditions after four months. Since we can't track that, perhaps the Free Movement conditions are required for EU citizens in addition to the tax condition.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, maybe I should proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the parent's conditions:\n\nThe user must have:\n\nEither:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability is ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability (covers first case)\n\nOR\n\n- if they are EU citizen (ff:isNationalOf a EEAplusCH), then they must meet the Free Movement conditions (the OR conditions listed)\n\nOR\n\n- if they are not EU, then they must have a residence permit that allows work (ff:entitlesToEmployment true) or be a refugee/asylee (ff:recognizedRefugee true or ff:entitledToAsylum true)\n\nWait, but the problem says for non-EU citizens, they must have either a residence permit allowing work OR be refugee/asylee. So that's another condition.\n\nSo the shape for the user would have a sh:or with three conditions:\n\n1. incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability\n\n2. (isNationalOf is EEAplusCH AND meets Free Movement conditions)\n\n3. (is not EEAplusCH AND has residence permit OR refugee status)\n\nWait, but how to model 'is not EEAplusCH' in SHACL? Since SHACL can't have NOT conditions easily, perhaps it's better to structure as:\n\nThe user must satisfy one of the following:\n\na) The user has incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability (this covers all cases where tax liability is there, including EU citizens)\n\nOR\n\nb) The user is an EU citizen and meets Free Movement conditions (since they must also meet those after four months)\n\nOR\n\nc) The user is not an EU citizen but has the residence permit or refugee status.\n\nBut in SHACL, this would need to be expressed with sh:or and nested conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first condition (a) is sufficient, but for EU citizens, they also need to meet the Free Movement conditions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first condition (a) is mandatory, but for EU citizens moving after 2019, they must also meet the Free Movement conditions. Since SHACL can't track that, perhaps the Free Movement conditions are required for EU citizens in addition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first condition (tax) is mandatory, but the Free Movement conditions are additional for EU citizens beyond that. But the problem says the first condition includes EU citizens, so maybe the Free Movement conditions are part of the additional requirements for those moving after 2019.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe user must:\n\n- have incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability (covers the first bullet)\n\nAND\n\neither:\n\n- (if they are EU citizen, they must meet the Free Movement conditions) OR (they are non-EU and have the residence permit or refugee status)\n\nBut how to model that in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, the EU citizen case requires that if they are in EEAplusCH, then they must also meet the Free Movement conditions. So a sh:property with sh:hasValue for incomeTaxLiability, plus a sh:or for other conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's focus on the data properties and object properties available.\n\nThe Free Movement conditions for EU citizens:\n\nThey must have one of:\n\n- EmploymentStatus: Employee, SelfEmployed, JobSeeker, Unemployed (from ontology: ff:Employee, ff:SelfEmployed, ff:JobSeeker, ff:Unemployed are instances of EmploymentStatus)\n\nSo user's ff:hasEmploymentStatus must be one of those.\n\nOR\n\n- derive freedom from a relative (ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists, i.e., has a value)\n\nOR\n\n- adequateHealthInsurance is true (ff:adequateHealthInsurance = true)\n\nOR\n\n- permanentRightOfResidence is true (ff:permanentRightOfResidence = true)\n\nSo for the EU case, the user must have at least one of these.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nFor EU citizens (ff:isNationalOf in EEAplusCH):\n\nsh:or containing the four conditions above.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape would be:\n\nStart with a shape for the user:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n<https://foerderfunke.org/KindergeldShape> a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:nodeKind sh:Class ; sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ]\n            [ sh:nodeKind sh:Class ; sh:subClassOf ff:Country ; sh:not [ sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n        ) ;  # Wait, no, this is not correct. Maybe instead, split into cases.\n    ];\n    # For EU citizens (isNationalOf in EEAplusCH), must meet Free Movement conditions\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    # Wait, perhaps better to use sh:or to split into EU and non-EU cases.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or for the three main conditions (incomeTax, EU with FM conditions, non-EU with permit/refugee).\n\nWait, this is getting too complex. Maybe proceed with the following:\n\nThe main shape requires that the user has incomeTaxLiability as UnlimitedTaxLiability OR (if EU citizen, they meet FM conditions) OR (non-EU with permit/refugee).\n\nBut in SHACL, this is challenging. Alternatively, the incomeTax condition is mandatory, and for EU citizens, the FM conditions are additional.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability (covers first condition), and also, if they are an EU citizen (isNationalOf in EEAplusCH), then they must also meet at least one of the FM conditions.\n\nSo:\n\nThe shape has:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability must be UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nAND\n\nFor users who are EU citizens (isNationalOf in EEAplusCH), they must meet at least one of the FM conditions (EmploymentStatus, derive from relative, health insurance, permanent residency).\n\nAdditionally, non-EU citizens must have either residence permit allowing work or refugee/asylee.\n\nWait but the problem states for non-EU citizens, they need residence permit OR refugee status, but the first condition (incomeTax) might not apply to them. So maybe:\n\nThe user must:\n\nEither:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability (applicable to all, including EU and non-EU if they have that tax status)\n\nOR\n\n- (if not EU, they must have residence permit OR refugee/asylee)\n\nBut the problem's second bullet says for non-EU citizens, they need the permit or refugee status. So if they don't have the tax condition, they must meet the other.\n\nBut the first condition covers the tax case, so the OR is between the tax case and the non-EU cases.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let me try to write the SHACL step by step.\n\nFirst, the tax liability must be UnlimitedTaxLiability. This is a mandatory condition unless another path is taken.\n\nWait no, the first bullet says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz.\"\n\nSo the tax condition is required for all, including EU citizens. So the user must have incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nAdditionally, for EU citizens moving after 2019, after four months they must meet the Free Movement conditions. Since we can't track the move date, perhaps those conditions are required for EU citizens.\n\nSo for EU citizens (ff:isNationalOf in EEAplusCH):\n\nThey must have at least one of:\n\n- EmploymentStatus is one of (Employee, SelfEmployed, JobSeeker, Unemployed)\n\n- derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists (has a value)\n\n- adequateHealthInsurance is true\n\n- permanentRightOfResidence is true\n\nThus, the SHACL would have:\n\nA shape for ff:User with:\n\n- ff:incomeTaxLiability must be ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nAND\n\nIF ff:isNationalOf is a subclass of EEAplusCH, then they must have at least one of the above conditions.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be expressed with a sh:property that has a sh:or for the four conditions, but only if they are in EEAplusCH.\n\nThis requires a qualified shape.\n\nThe qualified shape would look like:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:or ( ... the four conditions ... ) ;\n    ]\n]\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, using sh:or to split into cases:\n\nThe user must have either:\n\n- (incomeTax is UnlimitedTaxLiability AND (if EU, meet FM conditions)) OR\n\n- (not EU and meet permit/refugee conditions).\n\nAlternatively, the following structure:\n\nThe shape has a sh:or with two branches:\n\n1. The user has incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability, and if they are EU, they meet FM conditions.\n\n2. The user is not EU and has residence permit or refugee status.\n\nBut how to model \"if EU then FM conditions\"?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe using nested sh:or:\n\nThe first branch (1) is:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability is UnlimitedTaxLiability,\n\nAND (for EU citizens, they must have FM conditions).\n\nThis can be modeled as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n],\n[\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:not [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isNationalOf ; sh:hasValue ?country ; sh:or ( ... check country is EEA ... ) ] ] ]  # Not EU, so no need for FM conditions\n\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path rdf:type ;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n                ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n                sh:or ( ... FM conditions ... ) ;\n            ]\n        ] ]\n    )\n]\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe I should simplify.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects the following:\n\nThe user must have:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability (mandatory)\n\nAND\n\nFor EU citizens (isNationalOf in EEAplusCH), they must meet at least one of the FM conditions.\n\nAND\n\nFor non-EU citizens (not in EEAplusCH), they must have residence permit allowing work OR be refugee/asylee.\n\nThus, the SHACL would be:\n\nsh:NodeShape for ff:User with:\n\n- incomeTaxLiability hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability\n\nAND\n\nA sh:or for the following:\n\nEither:\n\n- (isNationalOf is in EEAplusCH AND has at least one FM condition)\n\nOR\n\n- (isNationalOf not in EEAplusCH AND (has residence permit OR refugee/asylee))\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL.\n\nAlternatively, split into two properties:\n\nFirst, the incomeTax is required.\n\nThen, for the citizenship part:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:or (\n        [ sh:inversePath ff:isNationalOf ]\n        [ sh:inversePath ff:hasResidenceStatus ]  # Not sure\n    ) ];\n    # Not sure\n]\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Let's proceed with the child's conditions.\n\nThe child must have countryOfResidence in EEAplusCH or Germany.\n\nWait, the child's country must be in Germany or another EU/EEA/Switzerland country. So:\n\nThe child's countryOfResidence must be a Country that is a subclass of EEAplusCH (since Germany is part of that).\n\nSo in SHACL, the user (parent) must have a child (via ff:hasChild) whose countryOfResidence is in EEAplusCH.\n\nBut how to express that? Since the user is the parent, we need to navigate to their children.\n\nUsing SHACL's path expressions, we can do:\n\nFor the user's children:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ;  # Or sh:subClassOf?\n]\n\nWait, countryOfResidence's range is ff:Country. So each child's countryOfResidence must be an instance of a subclass of EEAplusCH.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:nodeKind sh:Class ;\n    sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ;\n]\n\nBut SHACL's path may require using sh:zeroOrMorePath or similar. Alternatively, the shape must ensure that every child has countryOfResidence in EEAplusCH.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have at least one child (since it's about Kindergeld), but the condition is that each such child meets the country condition.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Maybe I'll focus on the parent's conditions first.\n\nLet me try to draft the SHACL step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must have ff:incomeTaxLiability set to ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n]\n\nThen, for EU citizens (isNationalOf in EEAplusCH):\n\nThey must have at least one of the FM conditions:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus in (Employee, SelfEmployed, JobSeeker, Unemployed)\n\n- derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom exists (has a value)\n\n- adequateHealthInsurance is true\n\n- permanentRightOfResidence is true\n\nThis can be expressed with a sh:or of sh:property elements.\n\nSo for EU citizens:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Employee ]  # Not sure about the instances. The ontology has ff:Employee as an instance of EmploymentStatus.\n\n            [ sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n\n            [ sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\n            [ sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ; sh:hasValue true ]\n        ) ;\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, the EmploymentStatus instances are ff:Employee, ff:SelfEmployed, ff:JobSeeker, ff:Unemployed. So the first condition is that the user's hasEmploymentStatus is one of those.\n\nSo the first part would be:\n\n[ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:hasValue ?employmentStatus ; sh:or ( [ sh:hasValue ff:Employee ] [ sh:hasValue ff:SelfEmployed ] [ sh:hasValue ff:JobSeeker ] [ sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ] ) ]\n\nBut SHACL's sh:hasValue can't take multiple values unless using sh:or.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n[ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:in (ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed ff:JobSeeker ff:Unemployed) ]\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nSo the FM conditions are:\n\nsh:or (\n\n    [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ; sh:in (ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed ff:JobSeeker ff:Unemployed) ]\n\n    [ sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n\n    [ sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\n    [ sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ; sh:hasValue true ]\n\n)\n\nThus, the EU citizen part is:\n\nsh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:or ( ... )\n]\n\nNow, for non-EU citizens (not in EEAplusCH), they must have:\n\nEither:\n\n- residence permit that entitles to employment (ff:entitlesToEmployment is true on their residence permit)\n\nOR\n\n- recognized refugee (ff:recognizedRefugee true) or entitled to asylum (ff:entitledToAsylum true)\n\nThe residence permit is accessed via ff:hasResidencePermit, so:\n\nEither:\n\n- (ff:hasResidencePermit / ff:entitlesToEmployment) hasValue true\n\nOR\n\n- (ff:recognizedRefugee or ff:entitledToAsylum) is true.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n    sh:qualifiedMaxCount 0 ;  # Not EEAplusCH\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;  # Not sure, maybe better to invert.\n]\n\nAlternatively, for users not in EEAplusCH, they must have one of the other conditions.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Given time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to focus on the main points and ensure the SHACL is valid.\n\nThe final SHACL might look like this:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n<https://foerderfunke.org/KindergeldShape> a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:or (\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n                    sh:in (ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed ff:JobSeeker ff:Unemployed)\n                ]\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom ;\n                    sh:minCount 1\n                ]\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:qualifiedMaxCount 0 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:or (\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit / ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n                [\n                    sh:or (\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ;\n    ]\n.\n```\n\nWait, but the countryOfResidence for the child must be EEAplusCH or Germany. Since Germany is part of EEAplusCH, the class check is sufficient.\n\nHowever, SHACL's sh:class on a path navigates to the country's class. The countryOfResidence's range is ff:Country, which includes EEAplusCH as a subclass. So using sh:class with ff:EEAplusCH would require the country to be an instance of that class.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using sh:subClassOf.\n\nBut according to the ontology, EEAplusCH is a class, and countries like Germany are instances of it.\n\nThus, the path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence must be an instance of a subclass of EEAplusCH.\n\nHence, the SHACL for child's country:\n\n[\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:nodeKind sh:Class ;\n    sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ;\n]\n\nBut SHACL's path may require using sh:zeroOrMorePath. Alternatively, the country must be an instance of EEAplusCH or its subclasses.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n[\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ]\n        [ sh:class ff:Germany ]\n    )\n]\n\nBut since Germany is already in EEAplusCH, perhaps just checking the super class is enough.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n[\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:nodeKind sh:Class ;\n    sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ;\n]\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the countryOfResidence is an individual of a subclass of EEAplusCH, so the path should have:\n\nsh:class [ sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ]\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:class [ sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ] ;\n]\n\nBut I'm not sure about the syntax. Alternatively, the following:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:hasValue ?country ;\n    sh:constraint [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type ;\n            sh:subClassOf ff:EEAplusCH ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nThis might be more accurate, but SHACL syntax may not allow that.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n<https://foerderfunke.org/KindergeldShape> a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Parent must have unlimited income tax liability\n        sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # EU/EEA/Swiss citizens must meet Free Movement conditions\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;  # Must be EU/EEA/Swiss citizen\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:or (\n                # Employment conditions\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n                    sh:in (ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed ff:JobSeeker ff:Unemployed)\n                ]\n                # Derive freedom from relative\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom ;\n                    sh:minCount 1\n                ]\n                # Sufficient health insurance\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n                # Permanent residency\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ],\n    [\n        # Non-EU/EEA/Swiss must have valid residence permit or refugee status\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:qualifiedMaxCount 0 ;  # Not an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path rdf:type ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:EEAplusCH ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:or (\n                # Residence permit entitles to employment\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit / ff:entitlesToEmployment ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n                # Refugee/asylee status\n                [\n                    sh:or (\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                        [\n                            sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ;\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ],\n    [\n        # Child must reside in Germany or EU/EEA/Switzerland\n        sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:class ff:EEAplusCH ;  # Germany is included in EEAplusCH\n    ]\n.\n```"

Looking at the ontology, survivors' benefits might relate to being a deceased spouse or civil partner. The property ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner could be relevant here. Also, the insurance involved is probably ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. Maybe the user needs to have an insurance of that type?\n\nThe second condition is that the user has remarried or entered a new civil partnership after widowhood. The ontology has ff:MaritalStatus with subclasses like Married and CivilUnion. The property newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property of ff:MaritalStatus, which is a boolean. So the user's marital status should have newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nNow, translating these into SHACL constraints. The target node is ff:User. \n\nFirst constraint: The user must have a claim on survivors' benefits. Since the exact individual for survivors' benefit isn't listed, perhaps the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner. Alternatively, maybe the user must have an insurance linked to such a claim. Alternatively, the requirement might be that the user is a beneficiary via ff:deceasedSpouse or similar. Let's see the ontology properties. The ff:hasInsurance property links a person to an insurance they have. But the benefit in question is a survivors' benefit, which might require being a dependent of a deceased insured person. Since the ontology includes ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner, perhaps the user must have either a deceased spouse or civil partner. So, the user must have at least one of these relationships.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an insurance that provides survivors' benefits. But the ontology's ff:hasInsurance might not directly indicate that. Alternatively, the user's deceased relative must have had the insurance. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The exact ontology terms need to be checked. The Survivors' benefits (Hinterbliebenenleistung) typically require that the deceased was insured. Since the user is the beneficiary, they must be a surviving spouse or civil partner. So the user must have either a deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSecond condition: The user has remarried or new civil partnership after widowhood. The marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood flag set to true. So the user's marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must link to a marital status instance where the newUnionAfterWidowhood is true.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have two properties:\n\n1. The user must have at least one deceased spouse or civil partner. So either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner must exist. Since SHACL can have OR conditions using sh:or, we can check for existence of either property.\n\n2. The marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. So the marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must point to an object where the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood is true.\n\nAdditionally, the target node is ff:User, so the shape targets that.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nFirst, create a shape for the benefit, targetting ff:User. \n\nFirst constraint: Either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner must exist. Using sh:or with two path constraints.\n\nSecond constraint: The marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but how to express that the linked marital status has that property. So, the inner property is the data property of the object of hasMaritalStatus.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:hasValue with a node shape for the marital status. Hmm, maybe better to use a nested shape.\n\nAlternatively, the path can be a property path: ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood and then check that it's true.\n\nYes, that's possible. So the path is:\n\nsh:path [ sh:propertyPath ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:propertyPath ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ]\n\nThen sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:MaritalStatus ;  // Ensure it's a marital status instance\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nBut maybe the simpler way is to use a path with the two properties.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would look like:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Either deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner exists\n        sh:path [ sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or new partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first constraint uses sh:or on the path, which allows checking if either of the properties has at least one value. That should work. The sh:or is applied to the path, so the path is either of those properties, and the minCount 1 requires that at least one of them has a value.\n\nThe second property path is ff:hasMaritalStatus followed by ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood. The sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean would require that this property is true.\n\nI should also make sure that the marital status is present. But since the path requires the newUnionAfterWidowhood, if hasMaritalStatus is missing, then the path would not have a value, but the sh:minInclusive would require it to be true. Wait, that might not work. Because if the path doesn't exist, then the value is not present, which would not satisfy the boolean condition. So perhaps the user must have a marital status, and that marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood as true. Therefore, the path should check that the property exists and is true.\n\nAlternatively, the path's value must be exactly true. So, using sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean. That would require that the path's value is exactly true. But if the path is not present, then it's invalid. So combining with sh:minCount 1 on the path. \n\nWait, maybe better to structure the second constraint as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # Or sh:hasValue \"true\"\n    ]\n]\n\nBut in SHACL, the nested property can be done with the path being a property path. Alternatively, the above approach with path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood and sh:hasValue true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nThis would require that the path exists and has value true. So if the user has no marital status, then this would fail, which is correct because they must have a marital status that fulfills that condition.\n\nTherefore, the second property can be written as:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:message \"User must have a marital status indicating new union after widowhood.\"@en ;\n]\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe shape will have two properties: one for the deceased spouse/civil partner, and the other for the marital status's newUnionAfterWidowhood being true.\n\nAdditionally, the benefit's individual should be defined as a SocialBenefit with the given ID and labels, but the example shows that the shape name is based on the benefit's label. Following the example, the shape is named after the benefit's label, so perhaps:\n\nThe benefit's individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance retirement settlement\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner for survivors' claim.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or formed new civil partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in the example, the shape's name was the same as the label's German part, like \"Einstiegsgeld\". Here, the German label is \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\", so maybe the shape name is \"GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung\" without spaces.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final SHACL should include the individual definition and the node shape with those two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit individual\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance retirement settlement\"@en .\n\n# SHACL shape for eligibility validation\nff:GesetzlicheUnfallversicherungRentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have a deceased spouse or civil partner\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ \n            sh:or ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) \n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner for survivors' claim.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Must have remarried/new partnership after widowhood\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or formed new civil partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_582422. Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nThe first condition is that there must be an accident at work or on the way to work, or an recognized occupational disease. Looking at the ontology, the relevant classes for these are WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, and OccupationalDisease, all of which are subclasses of Event. \n\nThe second condition is that the person is participating in a qualified measure for participation in working life, specifically occupational rehabilitation. The ontology has the class OccupationalRehabilitation, so the user must have a participation in that. The property to link a person to a training or program is participates, so the path would be ff:participates with the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nNow, translating this into SHACL shapes. The main shape targets ff:User. The first condition requires that the user has an event of one of the mentioned types. So a property shape on ff:hasEvent must check the class is one of those three. Since SHACL allows using sh:class with multiple options, I can list them in sh:class.\n\nThe second condition is straightforward: the user must have a participation in an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. So another property shape on ff:participates with sh:class set to ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nI need to ensure the SHACL syntax is correct. The shapes should be node shapes with targetNode as ff:User. Each condition is a separate property constraint. Also, the messages should be in English as per the example.\n\nWait, the first condition's events (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease) are all subclasses of Event, so in SHACL, the sh:class can include those three. Let me confirm their URIs from the ontology:\n\n- WorkAccident is ff:WorkAccident\n- CommutingAccident is ff:CommutingAccident\n- OccupationalDisease is ff:OccupationalDisease\n\nYes. So the first property shape's sh:class should be (ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease).\n\nThe second condition uses participates to an OccupationalRehabilitation. The property path is ff:participates and the class is ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. Also, since participation is required, sh:minCount 1 is needed.\n\nI should structure the main shape with two properties: one for the event and one for participation. Each with their respective constraints. Also, the social benefit individual must be defined with its ID and labels.\n\nLet me check the example provided. In the example, they used sh:or for multiple shapes, but here the conditions are separate, so no need for or. Just two separate property constraints.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL would look like this:\n\nDefine the SocialBenefit individual first. Then create a NodeShape for the benefit, targetting ff:User. The first property checks that the user has an event of the correct type. The second checks participation in occupational rehab.\n\nLet me also include appropriate messages for each condition, similar to the example.\n\nI need to make sure all prefixes are correctly used, and that the Turtle syntax is valid. Also, use the correct property paths. For the first condition, the path is ff:hasEvent, and the class check. For the second, the path is ff:participates with the class.\n\nYes, that should cover the requirements without adding any extra constraints. Let me write this out properly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Transitional Allowance for Occupational Rehabilitation\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:UnfallRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582422 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: User has relevant accident or occupational disease\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has work accident/commuting accident/recognized occupational disease'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 2: Participates in occupational rehabilitation\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Participating in occupational rehabilitation'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this SHACL validation graph problem. The user wants to create a SHACL shape for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld' benefit. The conditions given are in German, so I need to parse those carefully. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each requirement step by step.\n\nThe first condition is: \"Sie ein Kind Ihres Haushaltes wegen der Folgen eines Versicherungsfalls (Schul und Kindergartenunfall) beaufsichtigen, betreuen oder pflegen müssen.\" So the user must care for a household child due to an insurance event (school or kindergarten accident). \n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant properties might be ff:hasChild, ff:caregiverInHousehold, or ff:needsCare. The insurance event could be a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, which are subclasses of Event. The user must be linked to an event that caused the need for care. Maybe the child has a CareNeed that is linked to an accident. \n\nNext, \"Ihr Kind das 12. Lebensjahr noch nicht vollendet hat\" means the child is under 12. So the child's age must be less than 12. The ontology has ff:hasAge as a data property on Person. So the child's hasAge must be < 12.\n\nThird condition: \"Sie vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung (z.B. Krankengeld, Arbeitslosengeld) hatten.\" The user must have had a claim to earnings or another benefit before the care started. The triggering event (the accident) caused a loss of earnings. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent on EarningCapacity, which links to an Event. Also, the event (accident) might have ff:causesLossOfEarnings set to true. Alternatively, the user must have had an employment or benefit before the event. Maybe the user's EarningCapacity's triggerEvent is the accident, and the event caused loss of earnings. \n\nFourth condition: \"keine andere in Ihrem Haushalt lebende Person Ihr Kind betreuen kann.\" No other household member can care for the child. The user must not have any other person in the household (via ff:sameHouseholdAs) who can provide care. The CareNeed must not have a caregiverInHousehold other than the user. So for the child's CareNeed, the caregiverInHousehold must be the user, and there are no others. Wait, actually, the condition says there is no other person in the household who can care. So for the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, there must be none except the user? Or that the user is the only possible caregiver. Hmm. Alternatively, the user's household (linked via sameHouseholdAs) must not have any other person who can provide care. \n\nNow, translating this into SHACL constraints. The shapes must target ff:User. Let's start with the first condition.\n\n1. The user must have a child in the household who is being cared for due to an accident. \n\nThe user must have a child (ff:hasChild). The child must be part of the household (maybe via sameHouseholdAs? Or the user and child share household). Alternatively, the child is in the household, so the user and child are linked via sameHouseholdAs. But maybe the care is for a household child, so the child must be in the user's household. \n\nThe care need (CareNeed) of the child must be linked to an event that is either SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. So the CareNeed's trigger event (triggeringEvent) must be one of these. Alternatively, the CareNeed is a result of an accident event. The user must be the caregiver? Or the caregiver is the user. \n\nAlternatively, the user has a child (ff:hasChild) who has a CareNeed that is linked to an accident event. The CareNeed must have a caregiverInHousehold which is the user. \n\nWait the first condition says the user must be the one providing care. So the CareNeed must have a caregiverInHousehold pointing to the user. \n\nAlso, the CareNeed's triggering event must be a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. \n\nSo for the first condition, the user must have a child (ff:hasChild) who has a CareNeed which is linked via caregiverInHousehold to the user, and the CareNeed's triggering event is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. \n\nAlternatively, the event causing the need is the accident, so the CareNeed's trigger event is the accident. \n\n2. Child's age under 12. So the child must have hasAge < 12. \n\n3. User had an earnings claim before the care started. The event (accident) caused loss of earnings. The user's EarningCapacity's triggeringEvent is the accident, and the event's causesLossOfEarnings is true. Or the user had an employment or benefit before the accident. \n\nWait the condition says \"vor der Beaufsichtigung ... einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder Geldleistung hatten\". So before the care was needed (i.e., before the accident happened), the user had a claim to earnings or benefit. \n\nSo the event (accident) must have a date, and before that date, the user had an employment (ff:inEmployment true?) or received a benefit (like Arbeitslosengeld). \n\nAlternatively, the user's EarningCapacity's triggeringEvent is the accident, and the EarningCapacity's reduction is due to the accident. Or the user's income before the accident was sufficient. \n\nHmm, maybe the user must have had an employment status before the accident. Since the accident caused the care need, the accident's date must be after the user's previous employment. \n\nAlternatively, the user's EmploymentStatus before the accident was something like Employed, but after the accident they had to take care of the child. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an employment or benefit before the accident, so the accident's date must be after when the user had that. \n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe using the ff:triggeringEvent on the EarningCapacity, which points to the accident, and the accident must have caused loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings true). \n\nThe user must have an EarningCapacity whose triggeringEvent is the same as the CareNeed's triggering event (the accident), and the accident's causesLossOfEarnings is true. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have an EarningCapacity whose triggeringEvent is the accident, and the accident's causesLossOfEarnings is true. \n\nSo for the third condition, the user must have an EarningCapacity linked via triggeringEvent to an event (the accident) which is a School or Kindergarten accident, and that event has causesLossOfEarnings true. \n\n4. No other household member can care for the child. So for the CareNeed, there are no other caregivers in the household. The CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must only be the user. \n\nAlternatively, the user is the only caregiver available. So, for the CareNeed, the caregiverInHousehold is the user, and there are no other persons in the household (via sameHouseholdAs) who can provide care. \n\nTo model this in SHACL:\n\nFor condition 1:\n\n- The user must have a child (ff:hasChild)\n- The child must have a CareNeed\n- The CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user\n- The CareNeed's triggeringEvent is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, the shape for the user must have a property path ff:hasChild that must have a child with a CareNeed, and so on. But in SHACL, maybe we need to structure it as:\n\nThe user must have a child (ff:hasChild ?child).\n\nThat child must have a CareNeed (ff:needsCare ?careNeed).\n\nThat CareNeed must have a caregiverInHousehold that is the user.\n\nThe CareNeed's triggeringEvent must be an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\nAdditionally, the triggering event must be the same as the one causing the EarningCapacity reduction.\n\nHmm, but how to link these in SHACL?\n\nMaybe using sh:property with paths.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:and to combine multiple conditions.\n\nCondition 2: the child's hasAge < 12.\n\nSo the child's hasAge must be less than 12.\n\nCondition 3: The triggering event (the accident) must have causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nSo the event (triggeringEvent of the CareNeed) must have causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nCondition4: No other caregivers in the household.\n\nThe CareNeed must not have any caregiverInHousehold that is someone else in the household.\n\nAlternatively, the user must be the only caregiverInHousehold for that CareNeed.\n\nBut in SHACL, how to express that there are no other caregivers?\n\nMaybe using sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 and sh:qualifiedMaxCount 1 for the caregiverInHousehold, and the value must be the user. \n\nWait, the user must be the only caregiver. So:\n\nThe CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user. So the property must have exactly one value, which is the user.\n\nAlternatively, the user is the caregiver, and there are no other caregivers.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold\n\nsh:minCount 1\n\nsh:maxCount 1\n\nsh:hasValue ff:User\n\nWait but the user is the current node, so the path would be something like:\n\nIn the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the value must be the user (the target node). \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user.\n\nWait, in SHACL shapes, the target is ff:User. So the shape is for the user, and the CareNeed is a node connected via the user's child.\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Maybe breaking down each condition into constraints.\n\nAnother approach is to create a shape for the user, and then for each required condition, add a SHACL constraint.\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one child (ff:hasChild).\n\nThen, for each such child (via sh:property with path ff:hasChild), the child must have a CareNeed (ff:needsCare), which must meet the following:\n\nThe CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user (so the user is the caregiver).\n\nThe CareNeed's triggeringEvent must be a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident, and that event must have causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nAdditionally, the child's hasAge < 12.\n\nFor the fourth condition, no other household members can care. So, for the CareNeed, there are no other caregivers in the household. Since the caregiver is the user, and the user is in the same household as the child (since it's their household child), perhaps the absence of other caregivers is ensured by requiring that the caregiverInHousehold is only the user.\n\nAlternatively, the user must not have any other household members who can care. But how to model that?\n\nMaybe the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user, and there are no other persons in the household (sameHouseholdAs) who could be caregivers. \n\nThis might be difficult. Maybe we can state that the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user, and there are no other individuals connected via the sameHouseholdAs property of the user that are also caregivers.\n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user, and there are no other caregivers for that CareNeed. \n\nSo for the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the only value allowed is the user. \n\nThus, the constraints for the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold:\n\nsh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold\n\nsh:minCount 1\n\nsh:maxCount 1\n\nsh:hasValue ?user (but how to reference the user? Since it's the target node, maybe use sh:nodeKind sh:This for the path?)\n\nWait, in SHACL, when the path is ff:caregiverInHousehold, the target node is the CareNeed. The user is the target node (ff:User), so maybe the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user. So:\n\nIn the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the value must be the user. So:\n\nsh:property [ \n\n    sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n\n].\n\nBut in SHACL, you can't directly reference the target node. Hmm. Wait, the CareNeed is part of the user's data, so the user has a child who has a CareNeed, and the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user. So in the CareNeed's shape, the caregiverInHousehold must be the user. But how to express that the value is the user?\n\nAlternatively, using sh:sparql:\n\nMaybe using a SPARQL constraint to check that for each CareNeed linked via the user's child, the caregiver is the user, and there are no other caregivers in the household.\n\nBut the problem is that SHACL Core doesn't have SPARQL, only Core components. The user specified to use SHACL Core constraint components only.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps for the fourth condition, it's impossible to model exactly because it requires checking other nodes in the graph. Since the user can't use SPARQL, maybe this condition is too complex and cannot be modeled with SHACL Core. But the user's instruction says not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. Alternatively, maybe the fourth condition can be inferred via the first condition that the caregiver must be the user, and thus others are not caregivers. Maybe the fourth condition is redundant if the first ensures only the user is the caregiver.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth condition requires that no other household member can care. So, perhaps there's no other person in the household (sameHouseholdAs) who can provide care. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sufficient that the user is the only caregiver, so the caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user, which can be modeled by having minCount and maxCount of 1 and the value being the user. But how to express the value is the user?\n\nWait, the target node is ff:User. So in the CareNeed's shape, the caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user. To do this in SHACL Core:\n\nWithin the CareNeed's shape (which is part of the user's shape's property paths), the caregiverInHousehold must be the user. So in SHACL, the path is ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:caregiverInHousehold. The value of this path must be exactly the user.\n\nSo for the user's shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/(ff:needsCare/ff:caregiverInHousehold);\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nWait, but the path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:caregiverInHousehold would traverse to the caregiver. To have that value be the user, but the user is the target node, so the path would result in the user being the caregiver. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nFor the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the value must be the user (the target node). So using sh:property with the path ff:caregiverInHousehold and sh:hasValue ?this, where ?this is the user. But SHACL doesn't have variables. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:nodeKind sh:This for the value, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's impossible with SHACL Core, so we have to omit the fourth condition if it's not possible. But the user says to not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. The fourth condition is about no other caregivers in the household. Since the user can't check other people in the household via SHACL Core constraints without SPARQL, maybe this condition is too ambiguous or requires third-party assessment. So perhaps exclude it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth condition is implied if the caregiver is the user. Because if there are other caregivers, then the user might not be the only one. But the condition requires that no other can, so maybe the only caregiver is the user. Thus, requiring that the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is exactly the user. So the min and max count of 1 and hasValue the user. But since the user can't reference themselves, this might not be possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps this condition can't be modeled with SHACL Core, so we should exclude it. The user's instruction says to not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. Alternatively, maybe I can model it by requiring that the caregiverInHousehold is the user (so the user must be the caregiver), but that doesn't ensure others aren't. But maybe that's the best approximation. \n\nAlternatively, the fourth condition can be modeled by stating that the user must not have any other household members who are caregivers for that CareNeed. But how to do that without SPARQL? I think it's not possible. So maybe the fourth condition is too complex and should be omitted. But the user's problem says to strictly comply and not model ambiguous or third-party parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth condition is captured by the first condition's requirement that the user is the caregiver, so that's sufficient. The requirement says \"keine andere ... Person ... betreuen kann\", which means no other can, so the user is the only one. So maybe the first condition's caregiverInHousehold being the user is sufficient if the CareNeed only has that one caregiver. \n\nThus, proceed with that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User must have the following properties:\n\n1. Must have at least one child (ff:hasChild).\n\n2. For each child (via ff:hasChild), the child must have a CareNeed (ff:needsCare).\n\n3. The CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be exactly the user (ff:User). So the path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:caregiverInHousehold must have value equal to the user. But since SHACL can't reference the user node directly in a constraint, perhaps we can model it by requiring that the caregiverInHousehold is exactly the user's IRI. Assuming that in the data, the user is represented as ff:User, then the value must be ff:User. But in the ontology, ff:User is an individual. So the data would have the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold pointing to ff:User. So the constraint can be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nWait, but the path would traverse from the user to their child, then to the child's CareNeed, then to the caregiver (which should be the user). So the path's value is the user. So the sh:hasValue would check that the value is the user's IRI. \n\nYes, that should work. \n\n4. The CareNeed's triggeringEvent must be a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. So:\n\nThe CareNeed's triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of those classes.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:triggeringEvent;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n].\n\n5. The triggeringEvent (accident) must have causesLossOfEarnings set to true.\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n].\n\n6. The child's hasAge must be < 12.\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:hasAge;\n    sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n].\n\nWait, the child's age is linked via ff:hasAge. So the path is ff:hasChild/ff:hasAge must be less than 12.\n\nWait, the data property ff:hasAge is on the child (Person), so the path from the user is ff:hasChild/ff:hasAge. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:hasAge;\n    sh:maxInclusive 11;\n    sh:minInclusive 0;  // Not sure if needed, but to ensure it's a valid age.\n].\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User must have these constraints. Let's structure it step by step in SHACL.\n\nThe main shape for ff:User will have a sh:property for each of these conditions.\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one child:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nSecond, for each child (so, for each value of hasChild), the child must have a CareNeed:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nThird, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nFourth, the triggeringEvent must be the right accident type:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:triggeringEvent;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n].\n\nFifth, the accident must have causesLossOfEarnings true:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:needsCare/ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n].\n\nSixth, the child's age must be under 12:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:hasAge;\n    sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n].\n\nNow, check if all conditions are covered.\n\nThe fourth condition (no other caregivers in household) is omitted because I can't model it with SHACL Core. Since the user must not model requirements that can't be clearly assessed, and this would require checking other nodes (other household members), which can't be done with Core components, we'll exclude it. \n\nThus, the final SHACL graph should include all these constraints.\n\nNow, serializing this in Turtle:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ;  // To ensure only the user is the caregiver\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild/ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, maybe better structure:\n\nWait, the CareNeed is linked via ff:needsCare from the child. So for each child (ff:hasChild), the child must have a needsCare with those properties.\n\nAlternatively, nesting the properties:\n\nThe shape for the user includes:\n\n- hasChild with min 1.\n\nThen for each child, the child must have needsCare with properties:\n\n- caregiverInHousehold is User.\n\n- triggeringEvent is SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\n- triggeringEvent's causesLossOfEarnings is true.\n\n- child's hasAge <12.\n\nSo in SHACL, this can be structured using nested properties.\n\nWait, here's another way:\n\nThe user's shape has properties for each of the conditions:\n\n1. hasChild with minCount 1.\n\n2. The child's CareNeed must have certain properties.\n\nThis can be done with a property for hasChild with a nested shape that requires the child has needsCare with the required conditions.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:maxCount 1 ;  // Ensure only the user\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nWait, but this would require that for each child, the child has needsCare, and that CareNeed has those properties, plus the child's age is under 12. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe user's shape:\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n    # Must have at least one child\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            # For each child, they must have a CareNeed\n            sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:property [\n                # CareNeed's caregiver is User\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ;  # Only the user\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Triggering event must be the right accident type\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # The accident must cause loss of earnings\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Child's age must be <12\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n            sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the structure may need to be adjusted. Each condition on the child is nested under the hasChild property's path.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a child (ff:hasChild) which has:\n\n- a CareNeed (needsCare) that meets the caregiver and triggering event conditions,\n\nAND\n\n- the child's hasAge is under 12.\n\nSo the sh:property for hasChild must have all these constraints.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nThus, the final SHACL code would be as above. Let me check for syntax.\n\nAlso, the target is ff:User, so the shape targets that.\n\nNow, serializing this properly in Turtle with all prefixes.\n\nWait, the ontology uses prefixes like ff: etc. So the SHACL prefixes should include sh: and the others.\n\nThe code would look like:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n            sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the CareNeed's triggeringEvent must exist. Also, the hasAge is on the child. \n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nThe user has a child (ff:hasChild ?child).\n\nThe child has a CareNeed (ff:needsCare ?careNeed).\n\nThe careNeed has:\n\n- caregiverInHousehold must be the user.\n\n- triggeringEvent must be school/kindergarten accident.\n\n- the triggering event must have causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nThe child also must have hasAge <12.\n\nIn the SHACL, the nesting is:\n\nsh:property for hasChild (the children) with:\n\n- a nested property on needsCare (so each child must have at least one CareNeed),\n\nand within that CareNeed's properties:\n\n- caregiverInHousehold etc.\n\nAdditionally, the child must have hasAge <12. So the hasAge is a separate property on the child, hence another nested property under hasChild.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nThus, the SHACL should look like this. Now, check all conditions are covered except the fourth, which I couldn't model. Since the user said to exclude requirements that can't be clearly assessed, this is acceptable.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n    # Requirement 1: User must have a child in the household requiring care due to school/kindergarten accident\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Requirement 2: Child must be under 12 years old\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n            sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Requirement 1 (continued): The child must have a CareNeed linked to an accident event\n            sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Requirement 1 (continued): Caregiver must be the user themselves\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Requirement 1 (continued): Accident must be school/kindergarten related\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                # Requirement 3: Accident caused loss of earnings\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent/ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the eligibility requirements of the 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' (Transition Allowance for People with Disabilities) based on the given text. Let me start by understanding the requirements and then map them to the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, the user must be the target node, so all shapes must point to ff:User. The SHACL shapes need to enforce the conditions step by step.\n\n**Main Conditions:**\n\n1. **Disability and Need for Support:**\n   - The person must have a disability (ff:hasDisability true).\n   - They need special support for workforce integration because of the disability (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a Disability).\n   - The rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency (ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ff:FederalEmploymentAgency).\n\n2. **Participating in Specific Measures:**\n   - The user must be participating in one of the listed training types. The ontology mentions ff:VocationalTraining, ff:School (maybe for berufsbildende Schule?), ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or other Training subclasses. The Participation is via ff:participates.\n\n3. **Pre-Employment Period (last 3 years):**\n   - At least 12 months of social security (ff:socialSecurityDuration with monthsWithinLast3Years ≥12).\n   - OR eligibility for Unemployment Benefit (ff:isEligibleFor ff:B100019_LB_576842 and has applied).\n   - OR eligibility for SVG Unemployment Benefits (ff:isEligibleFor ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG).\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\n- If a vocational returnee (ff:isVocationalReturnee true), the 3-year pre-employment period condition is waived. So, this might require a rule that if isVocationalReturnee is true, the pre-employment conditions are optional.\n- If in the last year before the measure start, they have a recognized qualification equivalent to vocational training. This involves checking for a qualification (maybe via ff:hasEvent linked to an event with a recognized certificate, but ontology might not have exact terms. Maybe use ff:recognizedByLaw? Or some property indicating the equivalence.)\n\n**SHACL Construction Steps:**\n\n**Shape for User (Main Shape):**\n- Target: ff:User\n- Components:\n  - MUST have ff:hasDisability true.\n  - MUST have a disability linked via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause (property path maybe).\n  - MUST have ff:hasRehabilitationProvider set to FederalEmploymentAgency.\n  - MUST participate in a specific Training (maybe via sh:property with sh:in to list acceptable types? Or check that the object is a member of certain classes).\n\nWait, the participation is via ff:participates, which must point to a Training instance of certain subclasses. So perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:class [ \n    sh:or ( \n      sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining,\n      sh:instanceOf ff:School,\n      sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea,\n      sh:instanceOf ... (other applicable classes)\n    )\n  ];\n]\n\nBut looking at ontology, the specific training types mentioned in the text include \"Berufsausbildung\" (VocationalTraining), \"Berufsvorbereitung\" (maybe part of VocationalTraining?), \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" (maybe part of VocationalTraining?), \"Maßnahme im Eingangsverfahren oder Berufsbildungsbereich einer Werkstatt für behinderte Menschen\" (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea), or \"berufliche Weiterbildung\" (could be Training subclass not listed? Maybe VocationalTraining is the best fit here).\n\nSo, the allowed classes for participation would be ff:VocationalTraining, ff:School (for berufsbildende Schule), ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and possibly others. Maybe also any subclass of Training except those not listed, but the text specifies the exact options, so better to list the exact ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all these are under ff:Training, but the SHACL needs to restrict to certain subtypes.\n\nSo, the ff:participates must point to an object that is an instance of any of the specified Training subtypes.\n\nNext, the pre-employment period conditions. The user must satisfy at least one of the three options. This is an OR condition. In SHACL, this can be handled with a sh:or within a sh:property.\n\nFor the three options:\n\n1. Social Security Duration in last 3 years ≥12 months:\n   - ff:socialSecurityDuration's monthWithinLast3Years ≥12. So the duration node must have ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ≥12.\n   - So, the user must have a socialSecurityDuration which is a Duration with monthWithinLast3Years ≥12.\n\n2. Eligible for Unemployment Benefit (B100019_LB_576842) and applied:\n   - ff:isEligibleFor includes this benefit.\n   - Also, maybe applied is represented by receiving or having applied? The ontology has ff:isEligibleFor and ff:receivedWithinLast3Years (but maybe applied is part of hasEmploymentStatus? Or maybe the eligibility alone is sufficient as per the text? The text says \"have entitlement and currently applied\". Since the ontology has ff:isEligibleFor and maybe ff:receivesBenefit, but not sure. The text says \"anspruch hat und aktuell beantragt\", so \"eligible and has applied\". But the ontology may not have an 'applied' property. Since the ontology's ff:isEligibleFor exists, maybe just checking that is sufficient? Or maybe the user is receiving the benefit? Not sure. The example might need to proceed with isEligibleFor.\n\n3. Eligible for SVG Unemployment Benefits (UnemploymentBenefitsSVG):\n   - ff:isEligibleFor includes this.\n\nSo, the user must have at least one of these three conditions. So, the shape for the pre-employment period could be a sh:or between the three.\n\nBut how to structure this in SHACL? Perhaps using a nested shape with sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, break into separate constraints and use sh:or in the main shape.\n\nNow, the exceptions:\n\nFirst exception: if isVocationalReturnee is true, then the pre-employment period conditions are not required. So this is a conditional exemption. In SHACL, this can be done via sh:or where either the user is a vocational returnee (so the pre-employment conditions are not needed) OR they meet the pre-employment conditions.\n\nSecond exception: if within the last year before the measure start, they have a recognized qualification. The text says either:\n\na) Earned a qualification at a vocational school or institution equivalent to an recognized vocational training, or\n\nb) Obtained a certificate equivalent to vocational training.\n\nLooking at the ontology, perhaps ff:participates in a Training that is recognized (ff:recognizedByLaw?), or has an event that is a recognized qualification. Alternatively, maybe the training has ff:recognizedByLaw. For example, the training instance should be recognized by a legal code (ff:recognizedByLaw some ff:LegalCode).\n\nAlternatively, the user has an event (ff:hasEvent) that is a qualification, but I'm not sure. Since the ontology includes ff:Training and ff:recognizedByLaw, maybe the training they participated in must be recognized by a legal code, and the training's duration was within the last year. But the timing is tricky. The \"within the last year before measure start\" might require a temporal constraint, which is hard to model without temporal SHACL extensions, which aren't allowed here. The problem states to not model ambiguous requirements, so maybe this part is too vague and should be omitted. The user instruction says to exclude ambiguous requirements, so perhaps this exception can't be modeled and should be omitted. Wait, the text says \"if within the last year before the measure start\" they have such a certificate. Without a way to model time constraints (e.g., date of the certificate), this might be too ambiguous. Since the ontology has ff:hasDate for events, perhaps the event (e.g., an event representing the qualification) must have a date within the last year before the measure start. But how to express that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't do date calculations, this might be unmodelable, so the exception might have to be excluded. Hmm, but maybe the exception is to waive the pre-employment conditions, so if the user has the qualification, the 3-year period isn't required. So the shape could have an OR condition where either the user meets the pre-employment conditions OR has the qualification. But again, without temporal info, maybe this is not possible. Since the problem says to exclude requirements that can't be clearly assessed, perhaps this exception must be omitted. The user instruction says not to model ambiguous requirements, so I'll proceed without it unless there's a clear way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a Training instance with a certain property indicating equivalence. For example, if the training has ff:recognizedByLaw, then that's sufficient. But the text says the qualification must be equivalent to an recognized vocational training. The ontology's ff:Training has ff:recognizedByLaw, so if the user has a Training with ff:recognizedByLaw (some LegalCode), and that training was within the last year (but without dates, can't check), maybe we can ignore the timing and just require the existence of such a training. But that might not fully capture the requirement. Since the timing is unclear, perhaps the exception is too ambiguous and should be omitted. The user instruction says to not model ambiguous requirements, so better exclude it.\n\nThus, the main exceptions would be the first one (vocational returnee) and the second's first part is ambiguous (timing) and the second part (certificate) also requires temporal info. So maybe only the first exception is modelable.\n\nSo, for the first exception (vocational returnee), the pre-employment conditions are optional. So the user can either be a vocational returnee (so pre-employment conditions are not needed) OR satisfy the pre-employment conditions.\n\nTherefore, structuring the pre-employment part as:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n [ ... the three pre-employment conditions ... ]\n\n)\n\nWait, but the exception is that if they are a vocational returnee, the 3-year requirement is waived. So the pre-employment conditions (the three options) are required unless they are a vocational returnee. So the condition is:\n\nEither (isVocationalReturnee is true) OR (one of the three pre-employment conditions is met)\n\nTherefore, in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ ... the pre-employment path ... ];\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    [ ... the three options ... ]\n  )\n]\n\nHmm, perhaps better structure the pre-employment requirements as a group that is optional if isVocationalReturnee is true. Alternatively, the overall condition for the user must satisfy either isVocationalReturnee OR the pre-employment conditions.\n\nPutting it all together, the main shape for the user would have several sh:property constraints:\n\n1. Disability and support:\n   - ff:hasDisability must be true.\n   - There must be a Disability linked via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause (so the user has at least one Disability connected via that property).\n   - hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n2. Participation in training:\n   - Must have a participates to a Training of certain types.\n\n3. Pre-employment period conditions OR is VocationalReturnee.\n\nNow, writing the SHACL in Turtle.\n\nLet me start with the shape for ff:User:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:Disability ;  # Ensure the target is a Disability\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class [\n      sh:or (\n        sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining\n        sh:instanceOf ff:School\n        sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n      )\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [] ;  # This part is for the pre-employment conditions\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      [ \n        sh:or (\n          # Option 1: 12 months social security in last 3 years\n          [\n            sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ;\n                sh:minInclusive 12\n              ]\n            ]\n          ]\n          # Option 2: eligible for unemployment benefit and applied (assuming eligibility implies applied)\n          [\n            sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n            ]\n          ]\n          # Option 3: eligible for SVG unemployment benefits\n          [\n            sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n            ]\n          ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ] .\n\nWait, the structure for the pre-employment part might be better as a nested or. Let me re-express the last property:\n\nThe user must satisfy either isVocationalReturnee (true) OR one of the three conditions (social security, unemployment benefit eligibility, SVG benefit).\n\nSo the last sh:property block would be:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    [\n      sh:or (\n        # condition1: social security duration\n        [ \n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ;\n              sh:minInclusive 12\n            ]\n          ]\n        ]\n        # condition2: eligible for unemployment benefit\n        [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n          ]\n        ]\n        # condition3: eligible for SVG\n        [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n          ]\n        ]\n      )\n    ]\n  )\n] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the sh:or must be on the same level. So the entire pre-employment check is a sh:or between the two branches (vocational returnee OR the three options). Each branch is a shape. \n\nAlternatively, the entire condition for the user is that they must have either the vocational returnee flag set, or at least one of the three conditions.\n\nThus, the correct structure would be:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:or (\n    # Branch 1: is VocationalReturnee\n    [\n      sh:property [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue true ]\n    ]\n    # Branch 2: meet one of the three conditions\n    [\n      sh:or (\n        # Condition 1: Social Security\n        [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:property [\n              sh:path ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ;\n              sh:minInclusive 12\n            ]\n          ]\n        ]\n        # Condition 2: Eligible for unemployment benefit\n        [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n          ]\n        ]\n        # Condition 3: Eligible for SVG\n        [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n          ]\n        ]\n      )\n    ]\n  )\n] .\n\nBut in SHACL, the sh:or must be applied within a sh:property. So the main sh:property has sh:or between the two branches. Each branch is a shape that requires either the flag or the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the entire shape would look like that.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for the properties:\n\n- ff:socialSecurityDuration is an object property from Person to Duration. So the user must have a socialSecurityDuration which is a Duration node with monthsWithinLast3Years >=12.\n\n- For the unemployment benefit eligibility, the user must have isEligibleFor linked to the specific SocialBenefit individual (ff:B100019_LB_576842).\n\n- Similarly for SVG benefit.\n\nNow, for the participation in training:\n\nThe user must participate in a Training that is an instance of VocationalTraining, School, or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The ff:participates must point to a node that is one of those classes. So the sh:class in the shape ensures that the object is an instance of any of those.\n\nNow, putting all together into Turtle syntax, ensuring proper nesting and syntax.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that all parts are correctly structured with sh:NodeShape, sh:targetNode, etc.\n\nLet me write the full SHACL now, carefully:\n\n<snip>\n\nThe final shape would include all these constraints. Let me check again for any missing points.\n\nWait, the first condition also requires that the user's disability is the reason for needing workforce integration. The ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause must point to a Disability (already covered with sh:class ff:Disability).\n\nYes.\n\nThe rehabilitation provider must be exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency (hasRehabilitationProvider hasValue that individual).\n\nYes.\n\nThe participation in a specific training type.\n\nYes.\n\nThe exceptions handled for vocational returnee.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's all. The second exception about the qualification within the last year is not modeled because it requires temporal checks which are ambiguous without date properties, so it's excluded as per the rules.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # 1.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and wrap it in triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Kinderzuschlag' benefit based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one child who meets certain criteria. The child must be under 25, not married or in a civil partnership, and living in the same household. Also, the child shouldn't have priority claims over the benefit. The user must receive child benefit for the child, which is either Kindergeld or an equivalent from abroad.\n\nNext, the income conditions: as a couple, the family gross income must be at least €900/month, or as a single parent, personal gross income at least €600/month. The income after reductions shouldn't bring the child supplement to zero. They must not have considerable assets. The combined income plus other benefits must cover the family's needs under SGB II. The benefit is subordinate to other income sources for the child, so the user must pursue those first.\n\nNow, mapping this to SHACL shapes. The target is ff:User. Let's look at the ontology. The user must have a child via ff:receivesChildBenefitFor. The child's age is checked via ff:hasAge <25. Marital status should exclude Married and CivilUnion. SameHouseholdAs should link to User. Also, the child must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the Kinderzuschlag.\n\nFor income, if the user is a single parent (ff:isSingleParent true), check personalGrossIncome >=600. Else, familyGrossIncome >=900. The income's reducesChildSupplementTo must be >0. The user's hasConsiderableAssets must be false. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit should be true, but that's a data property on the user. Also, the user must not have other benefits that take priority, which is covered by the child's shape.\n\nI need to structure the NodeShapes. The main shape (ff:KinderzuschlagShape) targets User. It requires the receivesChildBenefitFor with a ChildShape. The income conditions use sh:or with two shapes for couple vs single. The income reduction check uses the hasIncome's reducesChildSupplementTo path. The considerable assets are a direct check on the user. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is another property on the user needing to be true.\n\nWait, the ontology's ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is a data property on Person, so the user must have that as true. Also, the 'nachrangig' part requires the child to have no priority claims, which is already in the ChildShape via hasNoPriorityClaimsOver.\n\nLet me check the ontology again. For 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver', the domain is Person and range SocialBenefit. So the child must have an edge to the benefit indicating no priority claims over it. So in ChildShape, the property path would be ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with value the benefit's ID.\n\nPutting this together in Turtle. The shapes for income are similar to the example. Also, the user must have canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit true. Need to include that as a property in the main shape.\n\nI think that's all. Now, structure the SHACL accordingly, making sure all conditions are covered with appropriate paths and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_581863 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Kinderzuschlag\"@de, \"Child supplement\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # At least one eligible child\n        sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"No eligible child found meeting all requirements.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        ff:IncomeShapeCouple\n        ff:IncomeShapeSingle\n    ) ;\n    # Income reduction must not nullify supplement\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo) ;\n        sh:minExclusive 0 ;\n        sh:message \"Child supplement would be reduced to zero.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # No considerable assets\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Considerable assets disqualify eligibility.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Can cover family needs with combined income/benefits\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Incomes do not cover family basic needs.\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# CHILD SHAPE\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Under 25 years old\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 25 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not married/civil union\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Same household as user\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over this benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ] .\n\n# INCOME SHAPE FOR COUPLES\nff:IncomeShapeCouple a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in (false) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n        sh:message \"Family gross income below required threshold.\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# INCOME SHAPE FOR SINGLE PARENTS\nff:IncomeShapeSingle a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n        sh:message \"Personal gross income below required threshold.\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL shape for the 'Bürgergeld' (Citizen benefit) with the IDLB B100019_LB_106311931 based on the given conditions. Let me go through the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be employable. The definition says they need to be able to work at least 3 hours a day and be at least 15 years old, but not have reached the retirement age. The retirement age is mentioned as 67 for those born after 1963, but varies for others. However, since SHACL can't handle dynamic age checks based on birth year directly, maybe we can use the 'hasAge' data property. The age must be between 15 and below the retirement age. But how do I represent the retirement age? The ontology has 'isPensionable' which is true if they've reached retirement age. So, the user's age must be >=15 and 'isPensionable' must be false.\n\nNext, they must be needy. This means they can't cover their basic needs and those of their dependent household members with their own income/assets, or priority benefits. The ontology has 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' which should be false. Also, they must not have priority claims over other benefits. The 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' object property should link to the relevant benefits like 'Wohngeld', 'Arbeitslosengeld', etc. Wait, the text says \"no priority claims over other providers or persons.\" The ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' which links to the SocialBenefit instances. So the user must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to each of those benefits. But how to list them? The examples used hasValue for a specific benefit. Maybe we need to require that for all required benefits, the user has a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver relation. Alternatively, perhaps the shape should check that the user has no such claims over any of the priority benefits listed. But in SHACL, maybe we can use sh:property with sh:hasValue for each of those benefits, but that might be too specific. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be receiving those benefits. Wait, the condition says they can't have priority claims, which might mean they aren't eligible for them. Alternatively, perhaps the 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' being false already implies that. Maybe I should focus on the data properties here.\n\nThe user must live in Germany. The 'countryOfResidence' should be Germany (ff:Germany).\n\nAlso, they need to be in Germany as their country of residence. So:\n\n- ff:countryOfResidence = ff:Germany\n\nFor the employment status: being employable. The ontology has 'employableHoursPerDay' which should be >=3. And 'hasAge' >=15, and 'isPensionable' is false.\n\nThe needy part: 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' is false.\n\nThe 'no priority claims' part: For each relevant benefit (like Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag), the user must have a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not be receiving those benefits. Wait, the text says \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern (zum Beispiel Wohngeld, Arbeitslosengeld, Kinderzuschlag)\". So they must not have claims over those benefits, meaning they are not eligible for them. So perhaps the user must not be receiving those benefits, or have an explicit hasNoPriorityClaimsOver. Since the ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver', maybe we require that the user has that relation with each of the priority benefits. But which benefits are considered priority here? The examples list Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, and Kinderzuschlag. Looking at the ontology, those are:\n\n- Arbeitslosengeld: ff:B100019_LB_576842\n- Wohngeld: ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n- Kinderzuschlag: ff:B100019_LB_581863\n\nSo the user must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver each of these. In SHACL, to check that for each of these benefits, the user has a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link. Since SHACL can't loop through, perhaps we need a sh:property for each. Alternatively, maybe the user must have at least one such link, but that's not correct. The condition requires that for all those benefits, the user has no priority. So each must be present. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be receiving those benefits, but that's different. Hmm. The exact wording is \"haben keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern [...] oder anderen Personen\". So the user must not have priority claims over those benefits, meaning they can't claim those benefits before others. So the user must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to each of those benefits.\n\nTherefore, for each of the listed benefits, the user must have a triple like user ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver benefit. To model this in SHACL, each benefit must be a value in the list. So in SHACL, we can have multiple sh:property constraints each requiring that the user has hasNoPriorityClaimsOver each of the specific benefits. Alternatively, perhaps using sh:in with a list of the benefits. Wait, but how to specify multiple required properties? Maybe three separate sh:property blocks each checking one of the benefits.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape will target ff:User and have several constraints:\n\n1. Country of residence is Germany.\n2. Age >=15 (using ff:hasAge >= 15)\n3. Not pensionable (ff:isPensionable is false)\n4. Employable hours per day >=3 (ff:employableHoursPerDay >= 3)\n5. Can't cover basic needs (ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false)\n6. For each priority benefit (Arbeitslosengeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag), the user has hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to them.\n\nAdditionally, maybe the user must not be receiving those benefits? But the condition is about having priority claims, so perhaps just the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is sufficient.\n\nNow, let's structure this in SHACL.\n\nFirst, define the NodeShape for Bürgergeld:\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Country of residence is Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"User must reside in Germany.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Age >=15\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:message \"User must be at least 15 years old.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not pensionable (isPensionable is false)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must not have reached pensionable age.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Employable hours per day >=3\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive 3 ;\n        sh:message \"User must be able to work at least 3 hours daily.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Can't cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unable to cover basic needs with own means or priority benefits.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority over Arbeitslosengeld\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; # Arbeitslosengeld\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over unemployment benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority over Wohngeld\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ; # Wohngeld\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over housing benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority over Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ; # Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:message \"User must have no priority claims over child supplement.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but each of these hasNoPriorityClaimsOver needs to be present for each benefit. So each of those three properties must exist. So each sh:property block checks that the user has a triple with that specific benefit as the object. Since SHACL allows multiple such constraints, each ensuring one of the three, that should work.\n\nAlso, check if there's any other conditions. The original text mentions \"leben in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" which is covered by the countryOfResidence.\n\nAnother point: The employable part also requires that the user hasn't reached the retirement age, which is handled by isPensionable being false.\n\nThe needy part: 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' must be false.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Now, let's write the Turtle code accordingly, ensuring all prefixes are correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931_Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Resides in Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"User must reside in Germany.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Age at least 15 years\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"User must be at least 15 years old.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not pensionable (has not reached retirement age)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must not have reached pensionable age.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Minimum 3 hours daily work capacity\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"3\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"User must be able to work at least 3 hours daily.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Inability to cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unable to cover basic needs with own means/priority benefits.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over unemployment benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; # Arbeitslosengeld\n        sh:message \"User must not have priority claims over unemployment benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over housing benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ; # Wohngeld\n        sh:message \"User must not have priority claims over housing benefit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over child supplement\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ; # Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:message \"User must not have priority claims over child supplement.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit described in the given text. Let me start by understanding the requirements provided. \n\nThe benefit is \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user must receive benefits from the basic security (Grundsicherung).\n2. The need for the support was determined in a discussion with their integration specialist.\n3. Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the start of the measure.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to map these conditions to the available properties and classes. \n\nFirst, the basic security benefit is likely the \"Grundsicherung\" which in the ontology examples is represented by \"L100040_LB_8664880\". Wait, in the example provided earlier, the housing benefit is \"L100040_LB_8665924\" (Wohngeld), so maybe the Grundsicherung is another individual. Wait, looking at the ontology's individuals:\n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals section, there's \"IntegrationAssistance\" which is a SocialBenefit. But the user receives \"Grundsicherung\" which might be \"Sozialhilfe\" (SocialAssistance) in German. Checking the ontology, there's an individual called \"SocialAssistance\" (Types: ff:SocialBenefit). Yes, that's probably the Grundsicherung. So the first condition would require that the user is receiving SocialAssistance. \n\nWait, the example uses \"L100040_LB_8664880\" but in the ontology, the individual with that label is \"L100040_LB_8665924\" which is Wohngeld (housing benefit). Wait, perhaps there's a typo here. Wait, the example in the problem's examples section has:\n\nIn the example given, the SHACL code uses \"sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880\" for Grundsicherung, but in the ontology, the actual individual for Wohngeld is L100040_LB_8665924. Maybe there's an error here, but I'll follow the example's approach. Wait, perhaps in the ontology, there's another entry. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals section:\n\nIndividual: ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n    Annotations: rdfs:label \"Housing benefit\"@en, rdfs:label \"Wohngeld\"@de\n    Types: ff:SocialBenefit \n\nHmm, so maybe the Grundsicherung (basic security) is represented by another individual. Let me see:\n\nIn the ontology, there's an individual called \"IntegrationAssistance\" which is a SocialBenefit. Wait, perhaps \"Grundsicherung\" is \"Sozialhilfe\" which is \"SocialAssistance\" in the ontology. Yes, the ontology has \"SocialAssistance\" as a SocialBenefit. So the user must be receiving SocialAssistance. So the first condition's SHACL constraint is that the user has a receivesBenefit link to SocialAssistance. Wait, the ontology has the object property \"receivesBenefit\" which links a person to a SocialBenefit. So the first condition would be that the user has at least one \"receivesBenefit\" to SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: The need was determined in a discussion with an integration specialist. The ontology has an object property called \"participates\" which links a person to a program like training. But how to represent the discussion with an integration specialist? Maybe there's a property related to having an integration specialist, but I don't see one in the ontology. The examples use \"Integrationfachkraft\" but the ontology might not have a direct property for that. The problem states not to model ambiguous requirements. Since the ontology doesn't have a property indicating that the need was determined by an integration specialist, maybe this condition can't be modeled. The user might not have a direct way to represent this in the data. The instruction says not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. So this second condition might be excluded because it's up to a third party's determination.\n\nThird condition: Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure started. The Jobcenter is \"FederalEmploymentAgency\" in the ontology (an individual of RehabilitationProvider). The participation is a Training (since the benefit is for measures like training). The ontology has \"subjectToContract\" property for Training, which links to VocationalTrainingContract, but maybe \"commissionedByEmploymentAgency\" is a data property. Wait, yes, there's \"commissionedByEmploymentAgency\" which is a data property on Training, with range boolean. So if the Training was commissioned by the employment agency (FederalEmploymentAgency), then this is true. Alternatively, perhaps the Training instance has a \"commissionedByEmploymentAgency\" set to true. \n\nBut the exact way to model this is that the user's participation in a Training must have been approved by the Jobcenter. The ontology has \"participates\" linking the user to a Training. So maybe the user's Training must have the commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true. So the user must have a Training that they participate in, and that Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe SHACL shape should target ff:User. \n\nFirst condition: User must have a receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition is ambiguous and possibly third party's decision, so omit.\n\nThird condition: User must have a participates link to a Training which has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\nFor the first condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nFor the third condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n        sh:message \"...\";\n    ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL path: \n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, maybe better to structure it as a nested property. The user must participate in a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nAlternatively, the path for the Training's property can be checked via a nested shape. \n\nAlternatively, using a property path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nYes, that might work. The user must have at least one participates link where the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nThe shape for the benefit would have two constraints: \n\n1. Receives SocialAssistance\n2. Participates in a Training where commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nNow, the IDLB is B100019_LB_102730340, but in the ontology, there's an example with B100019_LB_102716305, which is labeled as \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld\". The user's benefit has a different ID. Since the ontology doesn't list this specific ID, but the task requires creating the SHACL for the given benefit, we can define the benefit as an individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nNow, the NodeShape would target ff:User and have the two constraints.\n\nAlso, the example uses \"checksFundingRequirement\" as a custom predicate. The example's shape has ff:checksFundingRequirement pointing to the benefit. So perhaps we should include that too.\n\nThus, the final SHACL would look like:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102730340 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # First condition: User receives SocialAssistance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not receive basic security benefits\" ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Third condition: Participation in training approved by Jobcenter\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ; # Ensure the object is a Training\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            sh:message \"Participation not approved by Jobcenter\" ;\n        ]\n    ] .\n```\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the nested property might need to be structured differently. Alternatively, using a path and constraints on the path.\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL property shape for the participates path with a constraint on the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:Training ; # Ensure it's a Training instance\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"User must participate in a Jobcenter-approved training\" ;\n]\n\nThat might be better. Because qualifiedMinCount ensures that at least one of the participates links meets the condition.\n\nYes, that's probably the right approach. So the second constraint would use a qualified value shape to check that the Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would have two properties:\n\n- ReceivesBenefit to SocialAssistance\n- Participates in a Training (ff:participates) which must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true.\n\nSo the SHACL code would be as follows.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\n# Define the validation shape\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102730340 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Requirement 1: User must receive Social Assistance (Grundsicherung)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives basic security benefits'\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Requirement 3: Participation must be approved by Jobcenter (commissioned training)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;  # Ensure participates points to Training instance\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Participation must be Jobcenter-approved training'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (B100019_LB_582429). The user provided an example, so I should follow that structure.\n\nFirst, the requirements: the user must have statutory accident insurance and be unfit for work due to an insurance event (work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease).\n\nLooking at the ontology, the StatutoryAccidentInsurance is an individual of type Insurance. So the first constraint is that the user has this insurance via ff:hasInsurance. The example uses sh:hasValue to specify the exact insurance, so I'll do the same here.\n\nNext, the earning capacity must be UnfitForWork. The example uses sh:in to check the value and references a node shape for the triggering event. The triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent) must be one of the allowed classes: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nI'll create a node shape (CapacityReductionShape) for the EarningCapacity that checks the triggeringEvent's class. The example uses sh:or with sh:class for each allowed class. Need to make sure to include all three.\n\nAlso, ensure that the targetNode is ff:User and all components are SHACL Core. Don't add extra terms not in the ontology. The example didn't have any other constraints, so I think that's all. Let me check the ontology again for any missing properties, but the requirements seem covered. \n\nWait, the example's CapacityReductionShape is linked via sh:node in the property shape. So the EarningCapacity node must conform to that shape. That's correct here. Also, the messages should be in English as per the example. \n\nI think that's it. Now, structure the Turtle code accordingly, making sure prefixes are correct and syntax valid.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582429 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance injury allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVVerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582429 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: User has statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance\"@en\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: User is unfit for work due to valid insurance event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:UnfitForWork ) ;\n        sh:node ff:EarningCapacityValidation ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unfit for work due to valid insurance event\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# Shape for validating earning capacity reduction cause\nff:EarningCapacityValidation a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Triggering event must be work/commuting accident or occupational disease\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Bildung und Teilhabe' with IDLB L100040_LB_12280162. I need to make sure I understand the requirements first. The user must be eligible based on either receiving one of the listed benefits or if they can't cover the costs themselves and get an individual assessment. Also, age limits are up to 25 for education and 18 for social/cultural participation.\n\nStarting with the target node, it's always ff:User, so the NodeShape will target that. The conditions involve checking if the user is receiving certain benefits or qualifies through an individual assessment. The listed benefits are Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931), Wohngeld (ff:L100040_LB_8665924), Kinderzuschlag (ff:B100019_LB_581863), Sozialhilfe (ff:SocialAssistance), Asylbewerberleistungen (ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits), or if their family has low income.\n\nFirst, I need a shape that checks if the user is receiving any of these benefits. Using sh:or for each benefit. Also, there's an alternative path if they can't cover costs and have an assessment. But the problem says \"the possibility to have their claim assessed\" might not be directly modelable. Since the user must either receive one of the benefits or meet the other condition. Wait, the text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann, hat die Möglichkeit, seinen individuellen Anspruch...\" So if they don't get the benefits but can't cover costs, they can be assessed. But the SHACL must model eligibility based on these conditions. However, modeling the possibility of an assessment might not be straightforward. The user's eligibility would require either:\n\n1. They or their family receive one of the listed benefits, OR\n2. They can't cover costs themselves and have had an assessment.\n\nBut the SHACL needs to validate existing data. The second condition might require checking data properties like canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit or something similar. However, the exact ontology terms need to be checked. Let me check the ontology again.\n\nLooking at data properties related to income and coverage:\n\n- ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit: True if can cover basic needs with income/assets/priority benefits.\n\nWait, the condition says \"die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann\" which would mean can't cover those costs themselves. Maybe that's represented by a property like ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver or something else? Alternatively, perhaps the ontology has a property indicating inability to cover costs, but I might need to see if there's a data property for that. Alternatively, maybe ff:hasConsiderableAssets is the opposite. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds set to false, but that's about personal basic needs. The requirement is about covering the costs for education and participation. Since the ontology might not have a direct property for this, perhaps the problem states to ignore ambiguous requirements. Since the text says \"has the possibility to have their claim assessed\", but SHACL can't model that unless there's a property indicating an assessment has been done. Since the examples didn't include that, maybe we can focus only on the first part (receiving the benefits) and the age limit, as the other part might be ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n\nTherefore, the main conditions are:\n\n- The user is under 25 (hasAge <25)\n- Either:\n   a) The user or their family receives one of the listed benefits, OR\n   b) They qualify through the individual assessment (but maybe this can't be modeled and is excluded due to ambiguity)\n\nWait, the text says \"der Leistungsanspruch gilt für Kinder und junge Menschen bis zur Vollendung des 25. Lebensjahres.\" So age is a must. The benefits part: the user or their family must receive one of the benefits. So for the first part, checking if the user has a ff:receivesBenefit link to any of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen). Also, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" – that might translate to the family's income being below a threshold. The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome in ff:Income, but how is that linked? Maybe the user's income has familyGrossIncome below a certain value, but since the exact threshold isn't given, perhaps it's represented by another property. Alternatively, maybe the 'family with low income' is covered by existing properties like ff:hasConsiderableAssets (if false) or ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit being false. Since the problem says to not model ambiguous requirements, maybe the low income is considered part of the listed benefits or requires a property that's not present. Since the examples use minCount and hasValue, perhaps the family income part is considered as part of the listed benefits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'family with low income' is separate and needs a different check. Let me parse the requirements again:\n\nThe user is eligible if they or their family receive one of the listed benefits OR their family has low income. Wait, the original German says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another option. So the user must be in a family with low income even if not receiving the benefits. So the user must satisfy either:\n\n- receiving one of the listed benefits, or\n- their family has low income.\n\nBut how to model \"family with low income\"? The ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome in Income. So perhaps the user's income (ff:hasIncome) has a familyGrossIncome below a certain threshold. But the problem doesn't specify the exact value, so maybe this can't be modeled and we have to exclude it. Since the task says not to model ambiguous requirements, perhaps only the listed benefits and the age are considered.\n\nWait the problem says \"Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\" So the family income part might be ambiguous, so we might only include the benefits part. Let me recheck the text:\n\n\"Anspruchsberechtigt sind junge Menschen, wenn sie, beziehungsweise ihre Familien, eine der folgenden Leistungen beziehen: [list], Familien mit geringem Einkommen.\"\n\nSo the user or their family must receive one of the benefits OR their family has low income. But since \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition, it's separate from the listed benefits. But modeling that requires knowing if the family's income is low. Since the ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome, maybe we can check that it's below a certain threshold. But the problem doesn't specify the threshold, so that's ambiguous. Therefore, we can exclude that part. So only the benefits part and age are modeled.\n\nWait, but the user can also be eligible if they don't receive the benefits but can't cover costs and get assessed. But since that assessment is a possibility, maybe that's also at the discretion of third parties, so it's excluded. Thus, the main requirements are:\n\n1. User has age <25 (ff:hasAge <25)\n2. User or their family receives at least one of the listed benefits.\n\nNow, the listed benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931)\n- Wohngeld (L100040_LB_8665924)\n- Kinderzuschlag (B100019_LB_581863)\n- Sozialhilfe (SocialAssistance)\n- Asylbewerberleistungen (AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n\nAlso, \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition but might be ambiguous.\n\nSo for the first part, the user must be receiving one of those benefits, or their family does. But how to model \"their family\"? The ontology has relationships like ff:hasChild, ff:parentalAdress, but maybe the family is linked via some properties. Alternatively, maybe the user's family's benefits are represented via ff:receivesBenefit on the user, but the problem states \"sie oder ihre Familien\" so the user themselves or their family members. This complicates things because SHACL can't traverse to family members unless there's a property linking to them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's own benefits are sufficient, and the \"family\" part is considered as part of the listed benefits (like Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag are family-related). Maybe the problem expects to check if the user is receiving any of those benefits, regardless of being for the family.\n\nWait, the user's own receivesBenefit would link to the benefits they personally receive. For example, if the user is a child, their parent's Wohngeld might not be linked to the user. Since the ontology doesn't have a clear way to express family members' benefits, maybe this is ambiguous and we can only check the user's own benefits.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that the user or their family receives the benefits, but without ontology terms to model family members' benefits, this can't be done. Hence, perhaps only the user's own receivesBenefit is considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's family is considered via ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker or other family links, but that's unclear. Given the ontology's properties, perhaps the best we can do is check if the user is receiving any of the listed benefits. So the SHACL would require that the user has at least one of those benefits in their ff:receivesBenefit list, and their age is under 25.\n\nWait the problem says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is another condition, but without data properties, maybe it's excluded. So the main conditions are age <25 and receiving at least one of the listed benefits. The other conditions (like the possibility of assessment) are not modeled because they are at the discretion of third parties or ambiguous.\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nThe shape for the benefit (L100040_LB_12280162) would target ff:User. The properties would be:\n\n- hasAge must be less than 25 (sh:maxExclusive 25)\n- must have at least one of the listed benefits in receivesBenefit OR (but this is OR with other conditions that might not be modeled). Since the other conditions are excluded, the main requirement is that the user has at least one of the benefits listed.\n\nWait, but the user can be eligible either via receiving the benefits OR via family low income (excluded) or via the individual assessment (excluded). So the only modelable condition is the benefits and age.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would require:\n\n1. hasAge <25\n2. receivesBenefit includes at least one of the listed benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the benefit also covers Teilhabe (social/cultural participation) up to 18. But that's part of the benefit's scope, not an eligibility condition. The eligibility is up to 25 for education and 18 for Teilhabe, but the user just needs to be under 25 overall.\n\nSo the SHACL would look like:\n\nThe NodeShape for the benefit would have:\n\n- A property for hasAge with maxExclusive 25\n- A property for receivesBenefit with sh:hasValue for each of the benefits, using sh:or.\n\nWait, the benefits are multiple, so the sh:or would be for each of the listed benefits. Alternatively, since the user needs to have at least one of them, the path ff:receivesBenefit must have at least one of the listed instances.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]  # Bürgergeld\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]    # Wohngeld\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]     # Kinderzuschlag\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]      # Sozialhilfe\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ]  # Asylbewerberleistungen\n    )\n]\n\nAdditionally, the age condition.\n\nAlso, the benefit's ID is L100040_LB_12280162, so the SocialBenefit individual should be defined with that IRI.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\nff:L100040_LB_12280162Shape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"The user must be under 25 years old.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ]  # Bürgergeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]    # Wohngeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]     # Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]      # Sozialhilfe\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ]  # Asylbewerberleistungen\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"The user must receive at least one of the specified benefits.\"@en\n    ] .\n\nWait but the user can also be eligible via their family's benefits, but that's unclear in the ontology. Since we can't model family links, perhaps this is the best we can do.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which we can't model, so it's excluded. The other part about individual assessment is also excluded.\n\nTherefore, this should be the SHACL graph.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Age requirement: under 25 years\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"User must be under 25 years old.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must receive one of the listed benefits\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ] # Bürgergeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]   # Wohngeld\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]    # Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ]     # Sozialhilfe\n            [ sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] # Asylbewerberleistungen\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must receive one of the listed benefits: Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, or Asylbewerberleistungen.\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the given social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\" (Statutory Accident Insurance Pension) with IDLB B100019_LB_582404. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nThe benefit is provided if the person is statutorily accident insured and meets the following conditions:\n\n1. Their earning capacity is reduced:\n   * due to one or more insurance events,\n   * beyond the 26th week after the insurance event,\n   * by at least 20%.\n\nFirst, I'll check the ontology for the relevant properties and classes. The user must be linked to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance for being insured. The earning capacity must be reduced (ff:ReducedEarningCapacity?), and the reduction needs to be at least 20% (ff:reductionInPercent). Also, the reduction must be beyond 26 weeks (ff:reductionDurationInWeeks), and the cause should be an insurance event (ff:Event, maybe via ff:triggeringEvent).\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:EarningCapacity has properties like reductionInPercent and reductionDurationInWeeks. The triggeringEvent for EarningCapacity would link to the insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.). The insurance event must be of a type that's covered under statutory accident insurance, such as WorkAccident, SchoolAccident, etc.\n\nSo, the SHACL shape should target ff:User and include constraints for:\n\n- Must have an ff:hasEarningCapacity that is a ReducedEarningCapacity (or has properties indicating reduction).\n- The reductionInPercent must be >= 20.\n- The reductionDurationInWeeks must be >=27 (since it's beyond the 26th week).\n- The triggeringEvent of the EarningCapacity must be an instance of an insurance event (like WorkAccident, etc.).\n- The user must have ff:hasInsurance as ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure the insurance event is part of the accident insurance? The insurance event's type might need to be checked. Alternatively, since the user has StatutoryAccidentInsurance, any event covered by that insurance would be relevant. Maybe the triggeringEvent's type is an Event that's covered by accident insurance, but the ontology might not specify that. The example in the problem doesn't model such constraints, so perhaps we just check that there's a triggering event linked.\n\nSo, structuring the SHACL:\n\n1. The user must have an EarningCapacity with:\n   - reductionInPercent >= 20 (using sh:minInclusive)\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27 (sh:minInclusive)\n   - The triggeringEvent must exist (sh:minCount 1)\n\n2. The user must have ff:hasInsurance including ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nWait, the ontology's ff:hasInsurance is an object property to ff:Insurance. So the user should have ff:hasInsurance with value ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nAdditionally, the EarningCapacity must have a triggeringEvent that is an instance of an Event (but maybe any event, as long as it's part of the insurance cases).\n\nPutting this together in Turtle:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- TargetNode: ff:User\n- Properties for hasInsurance, hasEarningCapacity, and constraints on EarningCapacity's properties.\n\nWait, the EarningCapacity must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity? Or does the EarningCapacity just have to have those properties set? The ontology defines ff:ReducedEarningCapacity as an instance of EarningCapacity, so perhaps the user's earning capacity must be an instance of ReducedEarningCapacity, but maybe it's better to check the properties instead. Since the problem says \"reduction of at least 20%\", maybe the EarningCapacity doesn't have to be exactly ReducedEarningCapacity, but just have the properties set. However, the ontology might expect that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an EarningCapacity that is a ReducedEarningCapacity (since that's an instance), but also with the required properties. Let me check the ontology:\n\nIn the ontology, there's an individual ff:ReducedEarningCapacity of type EarningCapacity. So perhaps the user's earning capacity must be that instance. But the problem says \"reduction of at least 20%\", so maybe that instance already represents a reduction, but the exact percentage is captured in reductionInPercent.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user's earning capacity must be an instance of EarningCapacity (could be ReducedEarningCapacity), and then the properties on that instance must meet the criteria.\n\nSo, the SHACL could have:\n\nFor the earning capacity:\n\n- The user must have at least one ff:hasEarningCapacity (sh:minCount 1)\n- The earning capacity must have:\n   - reductionInPercent >=20\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27\n   - a triggeringEvent (sh:minCount 1)\n\nAdditionally, the user must have the insurance.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would look like this:\n\nFirst, define the shape for the User:\n\nff:GUV_Rente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ;  # Ensure it's an EarningCapacity instance\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but SHACL doesn't have a sh:class constraint in the core components. Oh right, the core components don't include sh:class. The user must use only SHACL Core components. So maybe instead, the hasEarningCapacity must have a value that is an instance of EarningCapacity, but how? Since SHACL core doesn't have that, perhaps it's better to not enforce that and rely on the ontology's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triggeringEvent must be an Event that's linked via ff:triggeringEvent to the EarningCapacity.\n\nAlso, the reduction must be due to insurance events. But how to check that the triggeringEvent is an insurance event? The insurance events are subclasses of Event, like WorkAccident, etc. Since the ontology has those subclasses, perhaps the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of them, but SHACL can't check for subclass membership with core components. So maybe that's out of scope unless the problem allows it. Since the user says to not model ambiguous parts, perhaps we can just require that the triggeringEvent exists, and assume that the application data will have the correct events.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triggering event must be of a type covered by accident insurance, but since the ontology doesn't have a property indicating that, maybe it's not possible. So proceed without that check.\n\nAlso, the reduction must be due to one or more insurance events. The triggeringEvent could be one such event, but the problem says \"eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle\" (one or more insurance cases). So perhaps the earning capacity's triggeringEvent could be a list, but in SHACL, maybe we just ensure at least one exists.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape would include the insurance, the earning capacity with the required properties, and the triggering event.\n\nWait, the user needs to have at least one triggering event for the earning capacity. So the hasEarningCapacity's triggeringEvent must have min count 1.\n\nAdditionally, the reduction must be due to one or more insurance events, but since SHACL can't enforce \"one or more\", but the triggeringEvent's existence is enough for at least one, perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL would look like the above, but without the sh:class.\n\nWait, the hasEarningCapacity must have at least one instance of EarningCapacity. But SHACL can't enforce that, so perhaps it's okay as long as the path exists and the properties are there.\n\nAlso, the user must be statutorily insured via ff:hasInsurance including ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nAnother point: The reduction must be due to an insurance event (Versicherungsfälle), which are events covered by the insurance. Since the insurance is StatutoryAccidentInsurance, the triggeringEvent should be one of the accident events (WorkAccident, etc.), but again, SHACL can't check that with core components unless the event's type is listed as a subclass. Since the ontology has those subclasses, maybe we can require that the triggeringEvent is an instance of, say, ff:Event, but that's redundant because it's already a subclass of Event. Hmm, perhaps it's better to not include that and rely on the data's correctness.\n\nThus, the final SHACL would be as I outlined above.\n\nWait, also the reduction must be \"infolge eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle\" - so the triggering event(s) must be insurance events. But without knowing the exact properties, perhaps it's sufficient that the triggeringEvent exists, as the user is already insured, so the events are covered by the insurance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triggeringEvent is linked via ff:hasEvent or another property, but the ontology shows that ff:triggeringEvent is defined for EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation, so it's correct.\n\nThus, the SHACL constraints are:\n\n- User must have ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance (sh:hasValue)\n- User must have a ff:hasEarningCapacity (minCount 1)\n   - That earning capacity must have reductionInPercent >=20 (decimal)\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27 (int)\n   - triggeringEvent exists (minCount 1)\n\nSo the Turtle code would be:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Metadata for the benefit\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# Shape for validation\nff:GUV_Rente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be statutorily accident insured.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have an earning capacity with required reductions\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have an earning capacity with required reductions.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n            sh:message \"Reduction must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"A triggering insurance event must be present.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Metadata for the benefit\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# Shape for validation\nff:GUV_Rente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Statutory accident insurance must be present\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be statutorily accident insured.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: Reduced earning capacity due to insurance event(s)\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a reduced earning capacity.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction must be ≥20% (reductionInPercent ≥20)\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction must persist beyond 26 weeks (reductionDurationInWeeks ≥27)\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must last at least 27 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Must have a triggering insurance event (e.g., accident)\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"A qualifying insurance event must have triggered the reduction.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' (B100019_LB_582441). Let's start by understanding the requirements from the given text.\n\nFirst, the eligibility criteria are:\n\n1. The user's spouse or civil partner died due to an insured event (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease).\n2. The user was in a valid marriage or civil partnership before the event.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n- If the marriage or partnership was formed after the insured event, and the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nLooking at the example provided, they used shapes to model these conditions. The example used ff:deceasedCivilPartner and ff:deceasedSpouse to link to the deceased partner, then checked if the causeOfDeath was an insurance event (WorkAccident etc.), and ensured the user was in a legal union before the event via legalUnionBeforeEvent.\n\nNow, I need to translate the exclusion into SHACL. The exclusion says that if the user formed the union after the event AND the death was within the first year, they are ineligible. So, the inverse would be that either the union was before the event OR the death wasn't within the first year. But since SHACL is about constraints for eligibility, we have to model this as a condition that must NOT be met. Alternatively, the constraint must ensure that the exclusion scenario is not present.\n\nAlternatively, the eligibility requires that it is NOT the case that the user formed the union after the event and the death was within the first year. To model this, maybe using sh:not in SHACL.\n\nBreaking down the exclusion:\n\nExclusion condition is (UnionAfterEvent AND DeathWithinFirstYear). The user must NOT meet this. So, the shape should have a constraint that (UnionAfterEvent AND DeathWithinFirstYear) is false. \n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? Let's think. The exclusion's first part is \"Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben\" which means the user entered the marriage/civil partnership after the insured event. The second part is \"der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist\" which is the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nTo model this, for each deceased partner (spouse or civil partner), we need to check:\n\nIf the marriage/civil partnership was formed after the event (the causeOfDeath event?), and the death occurred within the first year of the marriage/partnership.\n\nBut how to capture the timeline? The event (causeOfDeath) must have happened before the marriage, which is the opposite of the exclusion's first condition. Wait no: the exclusion's first condition is that the union was formed AFTER the event. So if that's true, then the user is excluded.\n\nSo the constraint for eligibility is that it's NOT the case that (union after event AND death within first year of union).\n\nBut in SHACL, constraints are for things that must hold. So perhaps the shape must ensure that either the union was not formed after the event, or the death was not within the first year.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL should enforce that either:\n\n- The union was formed before the event, OR\n\n- The death occurred more than one year after the union was formed.\n\nBut how to represent that?\n\nFirst, the event (the causeOfDeath) has a date (hasDate), and the marriage has a start date (when did the user form the union with the deceased?).\n\nWait, the ontology has properties like legalUnionBeforeEvent, which connects the event to the partner. So maybe the legalUnionBeforeEvent is already indicating that the user was in the union before the event. Wait, in the example, they required that the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. That might already handle the first part (the union was before the event). \n\nWait, the example's InsuranceEventShape has a property:\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n\nWhich ensures that the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. That would mean that the user was in the union before the event. So that handles the main eligibility condition. But the exclusion is about forming the union AFTER the event. So if the legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user, that implies the union was before the event, so it's okay. So the main condition is already covered. \n\nNow for the exclusion's second part: death within first year of the union. But the exclusion only applies if the union was formed after the event, which is already excluded by the main condition. Wait no, because the example's constraint already requires that the user was in the union before the event. So the exclusion's first condition (union formed after the event) would already be excluded by that. So maybe the exclusion's first condition is already handled by the existing constraint. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The example's InsuranceEventShape has the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user, which would mean that the user was in the union before the event. So if the user entered the union after the event, that would fail the main eligibility, so the exclusion's first part can't occur if the main condition is met. Therefore, perhaps the exclusion is redundant in this case. Wait, but the exclusion is part of the conditions given, so maybe I need to model it even if it's overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exclusion is an additional condition. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe main eligibility criteria are the two points. The exclusion is a case where even if those are met, they are not eligible. Wait, no: the exclusion says \"Sie haben in der Regel keinen Anspruch, wenn [condition]\". So if the user meets the exclusion condition, they are not eligible, even if the main criteria are met. So it's an additional condition to check for ineligibility.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL must include constraints for both the eligibility criteria and exclude the cases where the exclusion applies.\n\nHmm, but how to model that. Because SHACL is for defining what must be true for eligibility. So perhaps the exclusion criteria must be turned into constraints that must NOT be true. \n\nAlternatively, the exclusion condition must not be met. So the SHACL shape must have a constraint that the exclusion scenario is not present.\n\nThe exclusion scenario is:\n\n(UnionAfterEvent AND DeathWithinFirstYearOfUnion)\n\nTo ensure that this is false, the constraints must ensure that either:\n\nUnion was not after the event (i.e., before or same time as event)\n\nOR\n\nDeath not within first year of the union.\n\nBut how to represent these in SHACL?\n\nFirst, to check whether the union was after the event. The event has a date (hasDate). The union's start date would be the marriage or civil partnership start date. But the ontology doesn't have a property that directly captures when the marriage was formed. The ontology has legalUnionBeforeEvent, but that's a property of the event, pointing to the user, indicating that the user was in the union before the event. So if the marriage was after the event, then legalUnionBeforeEvent would not include the user, so the main condition would fail. Thus, the main eligibility condition already ensures that the union was before the event. Therefore, the first part of the exclusion (UnionAfterEvent) is already excluded by the main condition. Therefore, the only part left is the second part of the exclusion, but since the first part is already excluded, perhaps the exclusion's second part is irrelevant?\n\nWait, perhaps the exclusion scenario is when the user formed the union after the event (which is excluded by the main condition), AND the death occurred within the first year of the union. Since the main condition already requires the union was before the event, the exclusion's first condition can't be met, so the entire exclusion scenario is already excluded. Therefore, maybe the exclusion can be ignored, because it's already covered by the main condition?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where the union was formed after the event, but the legalUnionBeforeEvent still points to the user. That would be a contradiction. So perhaps the exclusion is redundant and doesn't need to be modeled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exclusion is about forming the union after the event, but the legalUnionBeforeEvent is required to include the user. Therefore, the exclusion scenario can't happen because if the user entered the union after the event, then legalUnionBeforeEvent wouldn't include them, so the main condition would already fail, making them ineligible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the exclusion is redundant and doesn't require an additional constraint. So the example's SHACL is sufficient.\n\nWait, but the problem's text includes the exclusion, so perhaps I should model it. Let me read again the exclusion:\n\nSie haben in der Regel keinen Anspruch, wenn\n\n  * Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben und\n  * der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist.\n\nSo, if both conditions are met (union after the event and death within first year), then they are excluded. \n\nThe main condition requires that the user was in the union before the event (so the first part of the exclusion's condition is the opposite). Therefore, the exclusion's first condition can't be true if the main condition is met. Therefore, the exclusion's scenario is already excluded. So maybe the SHACL provided in the example is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL from the example should work, but let me check again.\n\nThe example's shape for InsuranceEventShape has:\n\n- The causeOfDeath must be one of the three event types (WorkAccident etc.)\n\n- legalUnionBeforeEvent must include the user (so the union was before the event)\n\nSo any user meeting the main criteria is eligible, and the exclusion scenario is already excluded because the first part of the exclusion (union after event) would fail the legalUnionBeforeEvent condition.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL in the example is correct, and the exclusion condition doesn't need to be modeled separately.\n\nThus, the correct SHACL should be as in the example, but using the correct identifiers. Wait, the problem's example's SHACL uses the ff:B100019_LB_582441 as the SocialBenefit, which matches the current problem's benefit ID. Therefore, the example provided is actually the solution for this problem. Wait, looking back, the user provided an example with the same benefit, so perhaps the answer is the same as the example?\n\nWait, the user's input says \"TEXT: Es folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582441. [...] SHACL: [example]\".\n\nThen the current problem's TEXT is the same as the example's TEXT, so the answer is the same SHACL as the example? That can't be. Wait no, maybe the user is providing the example as a solved example to learn from, and now the actual task is another benefit, but the problem here is the same as the example. Wait looking at the problem:\n\nThe user says: \"Your task is to generate a validation graph using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) based on the description of eligibility requirements for a social benefit. [...] You will receive [...] Text: The social benefit description [...]\"\n\nThe Text provided here is exactly the same as the example's TEXT. So the problem is the same as the example's, so the SHACL should be the same as the example's. However, the example's SHACL uses the shape names like ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape, but the problem may require using different shape names, but SHACL allows any valid names as long as they are unique. However, the example's SHACL is correct, so perhaps the answer is the same.\n\nWait but the user's task says \"the social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph\" and the TEXT provided is the same as the example. Therefore, the correct answer is the SHACL from the example, but maybe with the exact formatting as per the problem's instructions.\n\nLooking at the example's SHACL:\n\nThey have:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ; [ ... ]\n\nThen the shapes: ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape, etc.\n\nThe problem requires that the output is in Turtle, within triple backticks. So the example's SHACL is correct. However, perhaps the user wants to ensure that it's exactly the same, but maybe the example's SHACL is the correct answer here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a solved example to guide, and the problem is actually a different benefit, but the user made a mistake. Wait no, the user's current problem's TEXT is exactly the same as the example's TEXT, so the SHACL should be the same. So the answer is to output the same SHACL as in the example, but perhaps with the exact formatting.\n\nWait but the user might have made a mistake and wants to test if I recognize that. Alternatively, maybe there's a difference. Let me recheck the problem's TEXT.\n\nThe TEXT given here is identical to the example's TEXT. The benefit ID is the same (B100019_LB_582441), the conditions are the same. So the correct SHACL is exactly the one in the example. Therefore, I should output that SHACL as the answer.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance widow's pension\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVWitwenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User's spouse OR civil partner died \n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n    ) .\n\nff:DeceasedPartnerShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n     # The deceased partner had statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Dceased person has statutory accident insurance'\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:InsuranceEventShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Death was caused by an insurance event' or 'User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:InsuranceEventShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Death was caused by an insurance event\n    sh:or (\n            [sh:class ff:WorkAccident]\n            [sh:class ff:CommutingAccident]\n            [sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease]\n     ) ;\n    # User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' benefit. First, I need to parse the requirements from the given text and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nStarting with the user's eligibility conditions. The first point mentions that they must live apart from their parents during training, and the company is too far, or they are at least 18, married, or have a child living with them. The ontology has ff:parentalAdress and ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany as a data property on Adress. So, the user must either have a parental address where the company is too far, or meet one of the age, marital status, or child conditions.\n\nNext, non-German residents: they can get the benefit unless they have an Asylum Act permit or are tolerated with less than 15 months. The ontology has ff:hasAsylumActPermit and ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months. So, the user must not have those, or if they are non-German, those conditions must not apply.\n\nFinancial need: they can't cover living costs, transport, family visits, clothing, childcare. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit and ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds. But maybe the user must not be able to cover these, so need to check the inverse.\n\nTraining eligibility: first vocational training, or if not, can't be integrated otherwise. The ontology has ff:isFirstVocationalTraining. For the non-first case, need a shape with a disability that reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently).\n\nTraining must be recognized under specific laws (CraftsCode, VocationalTrainingAct, NursingProfessionsAct, MaritimeLabourAct). The training must have ff:recognizedByLaw linked to these individuals.\n\nContract requirement: ff:subjectToContract with a VocationalTrainingContract.\n\nFor disabled users, additional cases: training in recognized forms, extension, repetition, etc. The training must have ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to a Disability that has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently.\n\nTraining abroad: for vocational training, part abroad must not exceed 1 year and be appropriate. For full abroad, needs equivalence. The ontology's ff:monthsAbroad and ff:percentAbroad properties could be used. Maybe for part abroad, monthsAbroad <= 12 and percent <= 50%? Or check the data properties' ranges.\n\nAdditional for preparatory measures: commissioned by employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency).\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes. The target is always ff:User. The main shape will have multiple AND constraints.\n\nBreaking down each condition into SHACL constraints:\n\n1. Living situation:\n   - Either (parental address exists and tooFar is true) OR (age >=18 OR marital status is Married/CivilUnion/Widowed/Divorced OR hasChild)\n   This requires using SHACL's OR via OR conditions. But since SHACL Core doesn't have OR, need to use sh:or with separate shapes.\n\n2. Residence conditions for non-Germans:\n   - NOT (hasAsylumActPermit OR (isTolerated AND uninterruptedLegalStay <15 months))\n   Need to check if they are German (ff:isNationalOf Germany) or if they don't have asylum permit and stay duration meets.\n\n3. Financial inability:\n   - NOT (canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit OR canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds)\n   Since they must not be able to cover, so the properties must be false.\n\n4. Training must be first or eligible under disability:\n   - Training has isFirstVocationalTraining OR (has a Disability that reduces prospects AND ...)\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe breaking into multiple shapes with sh:and and sh:or.\n\nAlso, the training must be of type VocationalTraining or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nFor abroad cases, need to check properties like monthsAbroad and percentages.\n\nNeed to ensure that all the conditions are covered without ambiguity. Also, using only SHACL Core components, so no SPARQL.\n\nPutting this all together in Turtle syntax, ensuring each constraint is properly linked. Need to reference the correct ontology terms and structure the shapes correctly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_574724 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe\"@de, \"Vocational Training Allowance\"@en .\n\nff:BerufsausbildungsbeihilfeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User must be unemployed.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n        sh:message \"User must be in vocational training.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                    sh:minIn \"1\"^^xsd:integer ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class ff:Disability ;\n                    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                    sh:qualifiedValueShape [ \n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                            sh:hasValue true \n                        ] \n                    ] \n                ] ]\n            )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Training must be first or due to permanent work integration issues.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingAct, ff:CraftsCode, ff:NursingProfessionsAct, ff:MaritimeLabourAct ;\n                sh:message \"Training must be recognized under applicable laws.\"@en\n            ] ;\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class ff:VocationalTrainingContract \n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                    sh:hasValue true \n                ] ]\n            )\n        ] \n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:parentalAdress ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany ;\n                sh:hasValue true \n            ] ] \n            [ sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                    sh:minIn \"18\"^^xsd:int \n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion, ff:Widowed, ff:Divorced \n                ] ] \n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 \n                ] ]\n            ) ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasResidenceStatus ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:Germany \n            ] ] \n            [ sh:and (\n                [ sh:not [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ;

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the social benefit 'Ausbildungsgeld' (B100019_LB_574711) based on the given conditions. Let me go through each requirement step by step and see how to translate them into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, the requirements are:\n\n1. The user has a disability (hasDisability is true) and their rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency).\n2. The user is participating in one of the specified measures:\n   - First vocational training,\n   - Vocational preparatory education including basic training,\n   - Individual company qualification within supported employment,\n   - Entry procedure or vocational training area in a workshop for disabled people or another service provider.\n3. The user has no claim to transitional allowance (so they shouldn't be eligible for the transitional allowance benefit, which is B100019_LB_102716305).\n\nStarting with the first condition: hasDisability and rehabilitation provider. \n\nFrom the ontology, the hasDisability data property is on the Person class. So, the user must have ff:hasDisability true. The rehabilitation provider is linked via ff:hasRehabilitationProvider. The provider must be exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency individual (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). So, a SHACL constraint for that would require the user to have a value of that individual on that property, and the hasDisability to be true.\n\nSecond condition: participating in one of the measures. The user must have ff:participates linked to a Training that is one of the listed types. The listed options include \"Entry procedure and vocational training in a workshop...\" which is the ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea class. The others like vocational training (ff:VocationalTraining?), but need to check the ontology for exact classes. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training. The first vocational training could be indicated by the isFirstVocationalTraining data property being true on the Training. Vocational preparatory education might be another subclass, but perhaps the ontology doesn't have an explicit class for that. The problem mentions \"individual company qualification within supported employment\" which might be covered under another subclass, but perhaps we can model it by checking if the training is of a certain type. Alternatively, maybe the key is that the participates must be to a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or another class, but since the exact classes aren't all listed, maybe we can rely on the data properties or other properties. Alternatively, the first part might require that the training is of type VocationalTraining and has isFirstVocationalTraining true. However, the exact mapping might be tricky. Since the example in the problem's example used a hasValue for a specific social benefit, maybe here we can look at the Training's type. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'participates' property's range is Training, and the allowed types include:\n\n- The user's training is an instance of ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or\n- The training is a VocationalTraining and has the property isFirstVocationalTraining = true, \n- etc. \n\nBut since the exact classes for all measures may not be in the ontology, maybe the key is that the participates must be to any Training, but with some conditions. Alternatively, maybe the first condition is covered by the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and the others are covered by other Training subclasses or properties. Since the problem might expect using the available classes, I'll check the ontology again. \n\nLooking at the ontology's Training subclasses, there's VocationalTraining and School, and EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The \"first vocational training\" might be indicated by the isFirstVocationalTraining data property on the Training being true. The \"individual company qualification\" might not have an explicit class, so perhaps the problem expects that any Training is acceptable as long as it's part of the listed options, but since the ontology might not have all, maybe the only explicitly mentioned one is EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and the rest are covered by VocationalTraining with the first being true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'participates' must be to a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or a VocationalTraining where isFirstVocationalTraining is true. \n\nSo, for SHACL, this might require that the user's participates target must have at least one of those conditions. Since SHACL can't do OR in property paths easily, perhaps multiple constraints with different paths. Alternatively, use sh:or. \n\nThird condition: no claim to transitional allowance. The transitional allowance is ff:B100019_LB_102716305. The user must not have an 'isEligibleFor' link to that benefit. So, the user should not have ff:isEligibleFor pointing to that benefit. \n\nNow, structuring this in SHACL:\n\nStart with the NodeShape targeting ff:User.\n\nFirst constraint: hasDisability is true.\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nSecond constraint: hasRehabilitationProvider is exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nThird constraint: participates in a Training that is of the correct type(s). \n\nThis is a bit more complex. The user must have at least one participates link to a Training that is either:\n\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or \n- VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true, or \n- etc. \n\nAssuming that the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is one of the options, and maybe others are covered by other types. But since the problem lists four options and only one is explicitly in the ontology, maybe the rest are considered part of other Training subclasses. Alternatively, perhaps the main point is that the participates must be to any Training, but the shape requires that the Training has the right properties. \n\nAlternatively, since the example used hasValue for a social benefit, perhaps here the Training's type must be one of the listed, so the shape can check for the Training's type. For example:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class [ a sh:ClassConstraint;\n        sh:or ( \n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ];\n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining; sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ]\n        )\n    ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nBut I'm not sure if SHACL allows that syntax. Alternatively, maybe using sh:node which is a NodeShape that enforces the Training to be of certain types or have certain properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that the participates must be to a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or another specific class, but since others aren't in the ontology, perhaps the example can just check for EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the participates must be to a Training instance, and the Training has to be of certain types. So the constraint would be:\n\nThe user must have at least one participates link where the object is a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea OR (instance of VocationalTraining and isFirstVocationalTraining is true).\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with sh:or in a NodeShape.\n\nSo the participates path must have a value that satisfies one of those conditions.\n\nTherefore, the constraint could be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:node [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n            [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nThis way, any Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true is acceptable.\n\nFourth constraint: The user is not eligible for the transitional allowance (B100019_LB_102716305). \n\nThis requires that the user does not have an ff:isEligibleFor link to that benefit. \n\nIn SHACL, this can be a sh:property with sh:disjoints:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor;\n    sh:disjoint ([ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]);\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nAlternatively, using sh:maxCount 0 with sh:hasValue, but disjoint is better here.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe node shape will have four properties: hasDisability, hasRehabilitationProvider, participates, and the disjoint for isEligibleFor.\n\nNow, checking the ontology again for the exact terms. The rehabilitation provider is ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, correct. The transitional allowance is ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (from the first example's SHACL which referenced that as transitional allowance). \n\nAlso, the first condition's hasDisability must be true, so the data property is ff:hasDisability with value true.\n\nAnother thing: The user must have at least one participates link. So the sh:minCount 1 on participates.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle:\n\nStart with the prefix declarations, then the social benefit's definition (though the example includes it, but maybe it's needed here? The problem says to generate the SHACL graph based on the description, so maybe we should include the benefit definition as well. The example included the benefit as an individual.)\n\nSo first:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training allowance\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # hasDisability is true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # has Rehabilitation provider as FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # participates in the required training types\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]  # For the entry procedure part\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n                    ]\n                ]  # For first vocational training\n                # Maybe add other conditions here if needed, but the ontology may not have all\n            )\n        ];\n        sh:message \"Does not meet required participation in training measures.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Not eligible for transitional allowance\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:disjoint ([ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]) ;  # The transitional allowance\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for transitional allowance, conflicting requirement.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the fourth constraint is that the user has no claim to transitional allowance, meaning they should not be eligible for it. The disjoint check here ensures that the user's isEligibleFor does not include that benefit. However, sh:disjoint on the property would mean that the path's values are disjoint with the specified node. Wait, maybe it's better to use sh:maxCount 0 with a sh:hasValue.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with sh:nodeKind sh:IRI and sh:not, but perhaps the simplest is:\n\nThe user must not have an isEligibleFor link to B100019_LB_102716305. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:disjoint ([ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]) ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 0 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValues (\n        [ sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ]\n    );\n    sh:message \"...\";\n].\n\nWait, qualifiedMinCount 0 with qualifiedValues would mean that at least 0 of those values are present, but that's not the right approach. \n\nWait, the disjoint approach says that the values of the path must not intersect with the specified set. So using sh:disjoint is correct here. The path's values (the benefits the user is eligible for) must be disjoint with the set containing the transitional allowance. So if the user has that benefit in isEligibleFor, it would violate the constraint.\n\nTherefore, the disjoint approach is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL should look like that. Let me check if all parts are covered.\n\nAnother point: The second condition's other parts like \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" might not be directly represented in the ontology. Since the ontology doesn't have an explicit class for that, maybe the problem expects that we only model the ones present in the ontology (like EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and VocationalTraining with isFirst true). So the SHACL constraints as above should suffice for the given ontology.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include all four constraints as outlined.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit individual\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main NodeShape targeting the User\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # 1.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL validation graph for the unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld) with IDLB B100019_LB_576842. The requirements provided are in German, so I need to parse them accurately and map them to the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the requirements carefully. The benefit is granted if the person is unemployed, which has several conditions. Let me break down each requirement:\n\n1. **Arbeitslosigkeit (Unemployment):**\n   - The person is not in an employment relationship, or works less than 15 hours per week.\n   - They must be available for placement efforts by the employment agency (availableForPlacement property).\n\n2. **Registration:**\n   - Registered unemployed electronically with an ID or in person. The registration must be done, which implies the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed.\n   - Also, they need to have submitted the application form, but since SHACL can't check forms directly, maybe this is out of scope. The ontology might not have a property for the form, so perhaps we can ignore this part as per the rules.\n\n3. **Versicherungszeit (Insurance Period):**\n   - Within the last 30 months before unemployment registration, at least 12 months of compulsory insurance. The ontology has ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 which is a boolean indicating this condition.\n\nNow, mapping these to the ontology:\n\n- For unemployment status:\n  - The user's employment status must be ff:RegisteredUnemployed (since they registered).\n  - The employment (if any) must have workHoursPerWeek < 15. But the ontology has ff:inEmployment (boolean) and ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. However, the user is a Person, so maybe they must not be inEmployment or if they are, their employment's workHoursPerWeek < 15.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"not in employment or work less than 15 hours\". So the user can have an employment but only less than 15 hours. But the ontology has ff:inEmployment (boolean) which is true if in any employment. So perhaps the inEmployment must be false, OR if true, their employment's workHoursPerWeek < 15?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, which might already imply being unemployed or working less than 15 hours. Let me check the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:RegisteredUnemployed is an employment status with the comment \"A person has officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\" So the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed. Additionally, the availability for placement (ff:availableForPlacement) must be true.\n\nFor the employment hours: The requirement says either not in employment OR working less than 15 hours. But if the user is registered as unemployed (RegisteredUnemployed), does that already cover that? The ontology's ff:Unemployed status has a comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" So perhaps the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed implies that the user meets the 15-hour condition. However, to be thorough, maybe we should also check that their employment (if any) has workHoursPerWeek <15? But since the employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, maybe that's redundant. Let me see the ontology again:\n\nThe ff:RegisteredUnemployed is a sub-class of EmploymentStatus, but the ff:Unemployed individual has the comment that explicitly mentions the 15-hour rule. So maybe the user's employment status must be either RegisteredUnemployed or Unemployed, but the problem states \"Sie stehen nicht in einem Beschäftigungsverhältnis oder Sie üben nur eine Erwerbstätigkeit in einem Umfang von weniger als 15 Stunden wöchentlich aus und...\" So combining both conditions. Wait, but the first condition is that they are unemployed (arbeitslos sind), which is defined by the employment status. The employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, which includes the 15-hour part. So perhaps the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed is sufficient for the first two parts of the unemployment condition.\n\nThus, the first condition translates to:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus = ff:RegisteredUnemployed\n- AND availableForPlacement is true (since the requirement says \"available for placement efforts\")\n\nNext, the registration part: The user must have registered, so their employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, which might already imply that. So maybe that's covered by the employment status.\n\nThe third condition: compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\n- The user must have employment status RegisteredUnemployed.\n- The user's availableForPlacement must be true.\n- The user's compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true.\n\nNow, looking at the ontology's properties:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus links a Person to an EmploymentStatus. So the user must have exactly one EmploymentStatus which is ff:RegisteredUnemployed.\n\n- The availableForPlacement is a data property of Person (xsd:boolean), so it must be true.\n\n- ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is a data property of Person, also boolean, must be true.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shape.\n\nThe target node is ff:User.\n\nWe need a shape that targets ff:User and has constraints on these properties.\n\nEach condition becomes a sh:property in the shape.\n\nFirst, the employment status:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed;\n]\n\nSecond, availableForPlacement must be true:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n]\n\nThird, compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n]\n\nAdditionally, maybe check that the user is not receiving other conflicting benefits? Wait, the problem statement doesn't mention that. The requirements given are only the listed ones, so perhaps that's all.\n\nWait the original text says \"Sie haben Anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld, wenn...\" followed by the three points. There's no mention of other benefits, so we don't need to include that unless it's implied. The problem says to not model ambiguous requirements, so stick to what's explicit.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape would be named something like ArbeitslosengeldShape, and the target node is ff:User.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ; # Assuming the ID is correct here\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User must have employment status RegisteredUnemployed.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must be available for placement.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have compulsory insurance for at least 12 of the last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first example uses ff:checksFundingRequirement, but that's not in the ontology. Wait the example had a property that's not in the ontology, but maybe that's okay? Wait the ontology's ObjectProperties don't include ff:checksFundingRequirement. So maybe that's a mistake in the example, but since the user says to use only terms from the ontology, perhaps I should avoid that. The example might have been illustrative but the actual ontology doesn't have that property. So perhaps just the node shape without that.\n\nAlso, the user's employment status must have exactly one value (RegisteredUnemployed). So sh:minCount 1 and sh:maxCount 1? Or just sh:minCount 1 since it's required. Since the requirement says \"Sie haben Anspruch wenn...\" which implies that these are necessary conditions, so they must have at least one value. So minCount 1 and hasValue ensures that the only possible value is RegisteredUnemployed. Alternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount with a filter? Wait no, hasValue requires that one of the values is exactly that. Wait, maybe the user must have that as their employment status. So hasValue must be present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the employment status must be exactly RegisteredUnemployed, so:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed;\n    sh:maxCount 1;\n    sh:message \"... must have exactly RegisteredUnemployed employment status.\"@en;\n]\n\nBut maybe the ontology allows multiple employment statuses? Unlikely, since it's a property of a person. Let me check the ontology:\n\nThe domain of ff:hasEmploymentStatus is Person, and the range is EmploymentStatus. Since EmploymentStatus is a class, perhaps each person has exactly one, but the ontology doesn't enforce that. So to ensure that the employment status is exactly RegisteredUnemployed, we can require that the value must be exactly that, and that it's present. So the hasValue and minCount 1 would suffice, assuming that the user can't have multiple employment statuses. But to be safe, maybe adding a maxCount 1 to prevent multiple.\n\nHowever, the problem states to use only SHACL Core components. So, if using sh:hasValue, it checks that at least one of the values is the given one. But perhaps the user must have that as their only employment status. Since the ontology doesn't define cardinality, but the requirement says \"arbeitslos sind\" which is covered by having the correct employment status. So proceed with the hasValue approach.\n\nAlso, the first example used a shape with sh:targetNode ff:User, which is correct here.\n\nSo the final SHACL should be as above, but with the correct ID for the benefit. The benefit's individual is ff:B100019_LB_576842 according to the text.\n\nWait in the problem statement, the TEXT says \"die Sozialleistung 'Arbeitslosengeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_576842\". So the SocialBenefit individual is ff:B100019_LB_576842, which is already in the ontology (see the Individual section):\n\nIndividual: ff:B100019_LB_576842\n    Annotations: rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, rdfs:label \"Unemployment benefit\"@en\n    Types: ff:SocialBenefit \n\nTherefore, the SHACL should reference that individual.\n\nThe shape should be named something like ff:ArbeitslosengeldShape, and the target is ff:User.\n\nI think that covers all the conditions. Let me check again:\n\n1. Employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed (covered by hasEmploymentStatus with hasValue).\n\n2. availableForPlacement must be true (data property).\n\n3. compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true (data property).\n\nYes. The other parts like registration method (electronic or in person) are about the process, not the eligibility criteria's data, so they are out of scope for SHACL which validates the RDF data, not the process steps.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL is as written above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User must have employment status 'RegisteredUnemployed'.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must be available for employment placement.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User must have compulsory insurance for at least 12 months in last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit described, targeting the \"ff:User\" node. The task is based on the provided ontology and the example given. Let me first parse the requirements from the text.\n\nThe benefit in question is \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\" with IDLB B100019_LB_102717659. The conditions are:\n\n1. The user has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of developing such a disability.\n2. Their rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\n3. Their prospects of participating in the workforce are significantly reduced permanently due to the severity of their disability, necessitating support.\n4. They must be willing to undergo vocational training or similar integration.\n\nLooking at the example provided, it uses SHACL's \"or\" for the disability condition, checks the rehabilitation provider, and ensures the disability's impact. I need to replicate that structure here, making sure to use the correct ontology terms.\n\nFirst, the User must have either a disability type (ff:hasDisabilityType) of VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, or be at risk (ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType). The example uses \"sh:or\" with qualified value shapes. The DisabilityShape in the example checks for the type and severeDisability being true, and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently being true. Since the requirement mentions \"hochgradige\" (severe), I need to include the severeDisability data property set to true. Also, the third condition implies that the disability is the reason for reduced work prospects, so the workforceIntegrationProblemBecause property should point to the disability.\n\nNext, the rehabilitation provider must be exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency. The example uses sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) for the hasRehabilitationProvider property.\n\nThe fourth condition about being willing to undergo training might be a data property, but looking at the ontology, there's ff:participates which links to Training. However, the requirement says \"bereit sein\" (be ready/willing), which might not be directly modeled. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for willingness, perhaps this is inferred if they are participating in a training program. Alternatively, maybe it's implied by other properties like availableForPlacement, but the example didn't include such a condition. Since the user must be \"bereit\", maybe it's captured by being in a training or having some intent, but since the ontology doesn't specify a property for willingness, perhaps this is omitted as per the rule not to invent terms. The example didn't include this either, so maybe it's assumed through other means or considered non-mandatory to model.\n\nWait, the example's last condition in their case was \"Sie sind bereit...\", and they used a property where the user is the inverse of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause. Wait, looking back at the example's SHACL, they have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in ( ff:User ) ;\n]\n\nThis seems to ensure that there exists a Disability where the user is the cause (since the property links Disability to the user). So perhaps the same approach applies here. The user must be linked via the inverse of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause to a Disability that meets the criteria.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape would have:\n\n- OR condition on hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType, each pointing to a DisabilityShape.\n- A property for hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n- The DisabilityShape must check type (Visual/Hearing), severeDisability, reducesWorkProspectsPermanently, and the inverse path to the user via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause.\n\nAdditionally, the User must be participating in training, but if there's no property for willingness, maybe it's not included. The example didn't model the last condition as a participation but perhaps the presence of the disability and need for support implies willingness. Alternatively, the example's last condition was modeled by the inverse path, so maybe here it's similar.\n\nWait, in the example's text, the fourth condition was \"bereit, sich beruflich bilden...\", and they used the inverse path for workforceIntegrationProblemBecause. Perhaps that's how they captured the need for support. The requirement here is similar, so the same approach applies.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL should include those components. Also, the IDLB in the text is B100019_LB_102717659, which is different from the example's B100019_LB_102716305. So the SocialBenefit individual must be correctly named.\n\nLet me structure the Turtle:\n\nFirst, define the SocialBenefit individual with the correct ID.\n\nThen, create a NodeShape targeting ff:User.\n\nThe OR condition for disabilities:\n\nsh:or ( [ hasDisabilityType with DisabilityShape ] [ atRiskOfDisabilityType with DisabilityShape ] )\n\nThe Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nThe DisabilityShape must:\n\n- Have rdf:type of VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment.\n- severeDisability true.\n- reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n- The user is the subject of workforceIntegrationProblemBecause (so inverse path).\n\nAlso, ensure that the Disability is linked to the user via the relevant object properties.\n\nWait, the atRiskOfDisabilityType is a property from Person to Disability, so the OR condition includes both hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType. The DisabilityShape applies to both cases.\n\nThus, the DisabilityShape's constraints ensure that the Disability is of the right type, is severe, and reduces work prospects. Additionally, the user must have that disability (either existing or at risk) as the reason for needing workforce integration help (via the inverse path).\n\nPutting this all into Turtle syntax, ensuring correct prefixes and structure.\n\nAlso, note that the example uses sh:checksFundingRequirement, but that might be specific to their example. Since the task doesn't mention that, perhaps it's not necessary here. The main components are the NodeShape with the constraints.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for correct property names and classes. The example used ff:severeDisability and ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently, which are data properties on Disability. The inverse path for workforceIntegrationProblemBecause: the property ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause has domain Person and range Disability. So the inverse would go from Disability to Person, so the user must be connected via that property. Hence, the inverse path ensures that the Disability is the reason for the user's workforce integration problem.\n\nTherefore, the shape should be correctly structured as in the example, adapted to the given conditions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit node\nff:B100019_LB_102717659 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\"@de, \"Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments\"@en .\n\n# Main validation shape targeting the user\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: Must have/severe visual/hearing disability or be at risk\n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape \n        ]\n        [\n            sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape \n        ]\n    ) ;\n    # Requirement 2: Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 4: Willingness implied through participation in training\n    # (Assumed by presence of disability-related conditions as in example)\n.\n\n# Shape for qualifying disabilities\nff:DisabilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Must be visual or hearing impairment\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must be severe\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must permanently reduce work prospects\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Must be the reason for workforce integration needs\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ; # Link back to user\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the Insolvenzgeld benefit based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the benefit ID is B100019_LB_576848, so I'll make sure to include that in the SHACL shapes. The main conditions are:\n\n1. An insolvency event occurred at the employer's side. This can be one of three scenarios:\n   a. Insolvency proceeding opened against the employer's assets.\n   b. Insolvency application rejected due to lack of assets.\n   c. Business discontinued with obvious lack of assets.\n\n2. The user didn't receive wages for up to 3 months before the insolvency event.\n\n3. The user is employed in Germany or temporarily abroad but still under German social security.\n\n4. The user must be legally recognized as an employee, even if they're a partner in a GmbH or similar.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the employer is linked via ff:hasEmployment and ff:employer. The insolvency events are subclasses of ff:Event, so I'll need to check their types. For the wage cut, the ff:wageCutOffsetMonths data property on the event must be between -3 and -1 months. \n\nThe employment status must be ff:Employee. For the country conditions, either countryOfEmployment is Germany or, if abroad, socialSecurityCountry is Germany. \n\nI should structure the SHACL shapes similarly to the example provided. The main shape targets ff:User and includes all the required properties. The insolvency event is checked with an OR of three shapes (A, B, C), each corresponding to one scenario. The wage cut is a shared shape (WageCutShape) to avoid duplication.\n\nI need to ensure all paths are correctly formed using the ontology's properties. Also, messages should be in English as per the example. Let me verify each part step by step to make sure I didn't miss any conditions or use the wrong ontology terms.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: Insolvency event occurred\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:employer) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            ff:EventShapeA\n            ff:EventShapeB\n            ff:EventShapeC\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency event at employer'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 2: Wage cut within 3 months before event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths) ;\n        sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n        sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Wage cut within 3 months before event'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 3: Employment location condition\n    sh:or (\n        ff:GermanyEmploymentShape\n        ff:AbroadEmploymentShape\n    ) ;\n    # Requirement 4: Legal employee status\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:in (ff:Employee) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Legal employee status'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# INSOLVENCY EVENT SUB-SHAPES\nff:EventShapeA a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path (ff:hasEvent rdf:type) ;\n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency proceeding'.\"@en .\n\nff:EventShapeB a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path (ff:hasEvent rdf:type) ;\n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Insolvency application'.\"@en .\n\nff:EventShapeC a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path (ff:hasEvent rdf:type) ;\n    sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Business discontinuation'.\"@en .\n\n# EMPLOYMENT LOCATION SHAPES\nff:GermanyEmploymentShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment) ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:AbroadEmploymentShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment) ;\n        sh:not [ sh:in (ff:Germany) ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the eligibility requirements of the 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' (Basic Security in Old Age and Reduced Capacity for Work) with the IDLB L100040_LB_8664880. Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nFirst, the user must be a person (ff:User), so all shapes should target that node. The SHACL constraints must check the following conditions:\n\n1. **Basic Eligibility Conditions**:\n   - The person must not be able to cover their basic needs from income and assets (canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false).\n   - They must meet one of three criteria:\n     a. Have reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII (aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true).\n     b. Be at least 18 years old and permanently fully reduced in work capacity (hasAge ≥18, hasDisability is true, and the disability reduces work prospects permanently).\n     c. Be at least 18, in an entry procedure and vocational training in a workshop for disabled people (like ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) or in a vocational training with a training budget.\n\n2. **Social Assistance as a Secondary Benefit**:\n   - No priority claims over this benefit (hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must link to this benefit and others with higher priority).\n   - Must pursue claims against third parties (like maintenance claims), and if not fulfilled, those claims transfer to the authorities.\n\nAlso, need to consider that Social Assistance is a secondary benefit, so other primary benefits must not be available.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the Social Benefit is likely represented by the individual with IDLB L100040_LB_8664880. However, in the provided ontology examples, there's an individual L100040_LB_8665924 (Housing Benefit), but the target here is another. Since the user didn't provide that exact individual, perhaps we should use a variable or assume it's part of the ontology. Wait, the ontology includes ff:SocialAssistance as a SocialBenefit. Maybe that's the one? Or maybe the specific ID is missing. Hmm, but the text mentions the benefit's ID is L100040_LB_8664880, which isn't in the ontology. Since the user requires using terms from the ontology, perhaps we should use ff:SocialAssistance as the benefit in question, assuming that's the correct mapping. Alternatively, maybe the example's ID is a typo, but since the ontology has ff:SocialAssistance, I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, translating each condition into SHACL constraints:\n\n**First Condition: Not able to cover basic needs**\n- DataProperty ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds must be false.\n\n**Second: One of the three options must be true**\n\nOption a: aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true. So, a shape with a constraint that this is true.\n\nOption b: \n- hasAge ≥18 (data prop hasAge with minInclusive 18)\n- hasDisability is true (data prop hasDisability true)\n- The disability must reduce work prospects permanently (disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true). Since disability is linked via hasDisabilityType or hasDisability? Wait, the ontology has ff:hasDisabilityType which links to Disability instances, and the data prop ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is on Disability. So need to ensure that any of the disabilities the person has has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. However, in SHACL, to check that at least one linked Disability has that property, perhaps using a path like ff:hasDisabilityType/rdfs:member? Wait, but in SHACL, the path would be ff:hasDisabilityType, which has range Disability, so we can check that for each Disability in the list, but how to ensure at least one has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. Alternatively, maybe the person's ff:hasDisability is true (which might indicate they have a disability), but the specific property on the disability. Hmm, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a Disability (hasDisability is true) and that disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. Wait, the data prop ff:hasDisability is a boolean indicating if they have any disability. But to check the property on the actual disability, maybe using a different property? Or perhaps the ontology has a way to link the person to their disability's properties. Alternatively, maybe the condition is that their disability (as per hasDisabilityType) has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. Since in SHACL, we can do a path like ff:hasDisabilityType [ a ff:Disability; ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true ]. But in SHACL Core, the Property Shape can have a path and a condition. However, SHACL Core doesn't support SPARQL constraints, so maybe using a SHACL Triple Constraint with the path to the Disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanente property. But how? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the data property ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is on the Disability instance. So, to check that the person has at least one Disability where reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true, you need to traverse from the person via hasDisabilityType to a Disability that has that property. But in SHACL Core, this would require a property path, but since SHACL Core doesn't support SPARQL, maybe using a SPARQL-based constraint? Wait, no, the user specified to use only SHACL Core. So maybe this is too complex and needs to be modeled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the ontology has a data property on the person indicating that their disability reduces work prospects permanently. Wait, looking at the ontology's data properties: there's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently which is a data property of Disability. So, the person's Disability instance must have that true. So, in SHACL, to express that the person has at least one Disability (via hasDisabilityType) which has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true, perhaps using a path like ff:hasDisabilityType [ ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = \"true\" ] but in SHACL Core, the triple constraint might not support that directly. Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe the condition is that the person has a Disability (hasDisability is true) and also has a DisabilityType with that property. But perhaps the user can only state that the person has a Disability (hasDisability true) and another condition that their work capacity is reduced permanently. Alternatively, maybe the person's earning capacity is reduced? Looking at the ontology, there's ff:EarningCapacity, and maybe if their earning capacity is reduced permanently. Wait, the user's condition is that the disability reduces work prospects permanently. Perhaps the EarningCapacity's ff:isPermanent is true? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the person has a Disability linked via hasDisabilityType where reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true. Since SHACL Core can't directly express this with SPARQL, maybe the user must ensure that the person has a Disability with that property. But in SHACL Core, the only way would be to have a property that aggregates that info, but maybe the ontology doesn't have that. This might be an ambiguous point, so perhaps the user can't model this requirement because it depends on a property of the Disability instance, which can't be expressed in SHACL Core without SPARQL. Therefore, maybe this condition is considered ambiguous and we can't model it. Wait, but the user says not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the data property ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is on the person? No, looking back: the ontology says ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is a DataProperty of Disability. So maybe the user must have at least one Disability with that property. Since SHACL Core can't express this directly, maybe this part is ambiguous and we can't include it. But the text says \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI sind\" which translates to permanently fully reduced in work capacity. Maybe the person's EarningCapacity is of type ReducedEarningCapacity (Individual) and is permanent. The ontology has ff:UnfitForWork as an EarningCapacity instance (type ff:EarningCapacity). Or perhaps the EarningCapacity has ff:isPermanent true and is a reduced one. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the requirement is that the person has an EarningCapacity that is permanently reduced (ff:isPermanent true and reductionInPercent is 100%?), but I'm not sure. Since the ontology's EarningCapacity has properties like ff:reductionInPercent, perhaps the condition is that their earning capacity is reduced to 100% permanently. Alternatively, maybe the person's ff:hasEarningCapacity is of type ReducedEarningCapacity and ff:isPermanent is true. But I'm not sure. This might be a point where the requirement is too ambiguous for SHACL Core without SPARQL, so perhaps we have to omit this part or find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the person has a disability (hasDisability true) and that disability's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true. Since SHACL can't traverse that relationship in Core, maybe this part can't be modeled and thus is excluded. But the user says not to model ambiguous parts. Hmm, tricky.\n\nOption c:\n- The person is at least 18 (hasAge ≥18)\n- They are in an entry procedure and vocational training (ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) or in a vocational training with a training budget (TrainingBudget is the SocialBenefit they have? Or they are participating in a training that is subject to a TrainingBudget?)\n\nLooking at the ontology, the individual ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training. So, the person must have a participation in such a training or in a vocational training (ff:VocationalTraining) that has a training budget. The TrainingBudget is a SocialBenefit, but how is it linked? Maybe the training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true) or has a subjectToContract of a VocationalTrainingContract. Alternatively, the person participates in a training that is an instance of ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has a TrainingBudget linked somehow.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement says \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten\" which translates to being in a training relationship where they receive a training budget. So the training must have a TrainingBudget. Since TrainingBudget is a SocialBenefit, maybe the person receivesBenefit TrainingBudget. Or perhaps the Training has a property indicating it's funded by TrainingBudget. But I'm not sure. The ontology's ff:Training has a ff:subjectToContract which links to a VocationalTrainingContract, but not directly to the budget. Alternatively, the ff:participates property points to the training, which must be either of the specified type or have certain properties.\n\nThis part might also require a SPARQL constraint, which isn't allowed. Hmm.\n\nThird condition: No priority claims over this benefit. So the person must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to this benefit and other benefits with higher priority. But since Social Assistance is secondary, they must not have access to higher-priority benefits. So the shape would require that they don't have any ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor any benefits that have higher priority than SocialAssistance. But how to model that in SHACL without knowing which benefits are higher? Maybe the ontology has a hierarchy, but it's not provided. Since this is unclear, perhaps we can only enforce that they have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to this benefit, but that's not sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the condition is that the person has no other benefits they are eligible for, which is too broad. This might be another ambiguous part. The text says \"Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere Unterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen.\" So they must pursue third-party claims (like alimony) first. But how to model that in SHACL? Maybe the person cannot have unfulfilled alimony claims, but the ontology doesn't specify properties for that. Since it's about pursuing claims against third parties, which might be outside the data model, this could be considered at the discretion of third parties and thus excluded.\n\nPutting this together, perhaps the main conditions we can model are:\n\n- canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false.\n- Either:\n   - aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true\n   - OR (hasAge ≥18 AND hasDisability is true AND has a Disability with reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true) [but this might not be possible]\n   - OR (hasAge ≥18 AND participates in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea OR participates in a VocationalTraining with certain conditions)\n\nBut due to SHACL Core limitations, maybe the second part (disability) is not modelable, so we can only require hasDisability true and maybe some other condition. Alternatively, maybe the user can only check hasDisability is true and the person's earning capacity is reduced (via ff:hasEarningCapacity being ReducedEarningCapacity). Let me check the ontology: ff:ReducedEarningCapacity is an instance of EarningCapacity. So the person's ff:hasEarningCapacity must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity and ff:isPermanent is true. So:\n\nFor option b:\n- hasAge ≥18\n- hasDisability true\n- hasEarningCapacity is a ReducedEarningCapacity (maybe via class check)\n- AND the earning capacity's isPermanent is true (ff:isPermanent true)\n\nWait, the EarningCapacity has an isPermanent property. So if the person's EarningCapacity has isPermanent true, that could indicate it's permanent. So:\n\nFor option b:\n- hasAge >=18\n- hasDisability is true\n- hasEarningCapacity's isPermanent is true\n- and the reductionInPercent is 100%? Or maybe just the existence of a ReducedEarningCapacity with isPermanent.\n\nAlternatively, the EarningCapacity must be of type ReducedEarningCapacity and isPermanent is true.\n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nFor the EarningCapacity part, perhaps:\n\nA shape for the User where the hasEarningCapacity is an instance of ReducedEarningCapacity and has isPermanent true.\n\nBut how to model that in SHACL Core? Using a class constraint:\n\nsh:class [ sh:in ff:ReducedEarningCapacity ]\n\nand a property constraint on isPermanent being true.\n\nSo putting together the conditions for option b:\n\n- hasAge >=18\n- hasDisability is true\n- hasEarningCapacity (a ReducedEarningCapacity) with isPermanent true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the EarningCapacity's reductionInPercent is 100% and isPermanent is true, but that's not specified in the problem.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated, but I'll proceed with the best possible given the ontology.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes.\n\nThe main shape will be for ff:User, with an OR condition between the three options.\n\nFirst, the base shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:BasicSecurityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:lessThan \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # must be false\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ]\n        [  # option b\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n                sh:class [ sh:in ff:ReducedEarningCapacity ] ;  # assuming this indicates the reduction\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n                    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n                ]\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        [  # option c\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int\n            ] ;\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:participates ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class [ sh:in ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] \n                ] ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:participates ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class [ sh:in ff:VocationalTraining ] ;  # assuming VocationalTraining is the right class for the training part\n                    # Additional constraints for training budget?

Not sure how to model\n    # Maybe ensure they don't have certain benefits\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:disjoint true ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ff:B100019_LB_576842 ff:B100019_LB_576986 ff:B100019_LB_581863 ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ) ] ;  # other benefits?\n    ] ;\n    # Or maybe just the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must include this benefit and others?\n    # This part is unclear, so maybe just require hasNoPriorityClaimsOver to SocialAssistance.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere Unterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen. Werden sie nicht rechtzeitig erfüllt und muss deswegen die Sozialhilfe eintreten, gehen die Ansprüche unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen auf die zuständige Stelle über, welche sie dann ihrerseits geltend machen kann.\" This implies that the person must pursue claims against third parties (like alimony) first, but if they aren't fulfilled, then Social Assistance can step in. However, modeling this would require knowing that the person has pursued such claims and they weren't fulfilled, which might not be in the data. Since this depends on actions taken by third parties, maybe this is considered ambiguous and thus excluded.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL would have:\n\n- TargetNode is ff:User\n- canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds must be false\n- OR between the three conditions (age, disability/reduced capacity, or training)\n- hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must point to the benefit (ff:SocialAssistance)\n\nBut for the disability part (option b), I need to ensure that the person has a disability and their earning capacity is reduced permanently. Since the EarningCapacity instance must be of ReducedEarningCapacity and have isPermanent true.\n\nAlso, for option c, the participates must be in the specific training types.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle code:\n\nThe Social Benefit in question is L100040_LB_8664880, but in the ontology, there's ff:SocialAssistance. Assuming that's the one. So:\n\nff:BasicSecurityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:lessThan \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;  # must be false\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [  # Option a: above age limit\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n            ]\n        ]\n        [  # Option b: 18+ and disabled with permanent reduction\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n                sh:class [ sh:in ff:ReducedEarningCapacity ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n                    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n        [  # Option c: 18+ and in specific training\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int\n            ] ;\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:participates ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class [ sh:in ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n                ] ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:participates ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:class [ sh:in ff:VocationalTraining ] ;  # Assuming VocationalTraining is correct\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n                    ]\n                ] ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ff:SocialAssistance ] ;  # Assuming this is the benefit\n    ] .\n\nWait, but for option c's second part (participates in VocationalTraining commissioned by employment agency?), the requirement says \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten\" which is \"in a training relationship where they receive a training budget\". The ontology has a SocialBenefit called TrainingBudget. So perhaps the training must have ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true, or have a subjectToContract of a certain type. Alternatively, the training must have a property like ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency true. The ontology has a property ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training. So that's why I added that condition.\n\nNow, checking for the SocialBenefit part: the person must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver to this benefit and others with higher priority. But since the user says to model only what's clear, perhaps the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver must exist for this benefit, but the other priority checks are ambiguous. So just requiring the existence of that property with this benefit's instance.\n\nAlso, the main shape must have all these conditions in SHACL's OR structure.\n\nFinally, the SHACL must be in Turtle and validate correctly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:BasicSecurityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:lessThan \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ; # Must be false (cannot cover needs)\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ # Condition A: Age limit reached\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n            ]\n        ]\n        [ # Condition B: 18+ with permanent reduced earning capacity\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n                sh:class [ sh:in ff:ReducedEarningCapacity ] ; # Must have reduced earning capacity\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n                    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean # Permanent reduction\n                ]\n            ]\n        ]\n        [ # Condition C: 18+ in specified training\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int\n            ] ;\n            sh:or (\n                [ # Entry procedure and vocational training\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:participates ;\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:class [ sh:in ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n                [ # Vocational training with budget\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:participates ;\n                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                        sh:class [ sh:in ff:VocationalTraining ] ;\n                        sh:property [\n                            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean # Training commissioned by employment agency\n                        ]\n                    ]\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    # Social Assistance is a secondary benefit (no priority claims over it)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [ sh:in ( ff:SocialAssistance ) ] ; # Ensure linked to SocialAssistance\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\" with the ID B100019_LB_103817036. The SHACL graph must target the node \"ff:User\" and be based on the provided ontology.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the requirements given in the text. Let's list each condition and see how to translate them into SHACL constraints using the ontology terms.\n\n1. **Both the user and the person they are accompanying are statutorily health insured.**\n   - The ontology has ff:hasInsurance with range ff:Insurance. The statutory health insurance is an individual ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance.\n   - So, the user must have an insurance of type ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance, and the accompanied person must also have the same. But how to link the accompanied person? The ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold which links a CareNeed to a Person. Alternatively, maybe ff:immediateCircleMember or ff:closeRelative? The user needs to be a closeRelative or in the immediate circle. Wait, the fourth condition mentions being a close relative or part of the immediate circle, so maybe that's handled later. For the insurance part, the user must have ff:hasInsurance [a ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance]. But also the accompanied person must have this. However, the ontology doesn't directly link the user to the accompanied person. Hmm. Maybe the accompanied person is linked via another property? Wait, the third condition mentions that the accompanied person is being treated stationarily. The CareNeed is a subclass of Event, and ff:needsCare links a person to their CareNeed. Maybe the accompanied person is the one needing care, and the caregiverInHousehold links the CareNeed to the user (the caregiver). So the accompanied person (the one in the hospital) is the person who has the CareNeed, and the user is the caregiverInHousehold. Therefore, the accompanied person would be the person who has the CareNeed. \n\n   Wait, but how do we get to the accompanied person's insurance? Maybe the user must have a relationship to the accompanied person (e.g., via ff:immediateCircleMember or ff:closeRelative), and that person must also have the insurance. But in SHACL, to express that the accompanied person's insurance is required, perhaps we need to traverse the relationships. However, SHACL Core doesn't support such path expressions beyond a few levels. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a property that links to the accompanied person, and that person must have the insurance. Let me check the ontology again for properties that can link the user to the accompanied person. \n\n   The user is the caregiver in the CareNeed. The CareNeed is linked via ff:caregiverInHousehold to the user. So the CareNeed is part of the accompanied person's needs. The accompanied person would be the one who has the CareNeed (via ff:needsCare). So the accompanied person is the subject of the CareNeed. \n\n   Therefore, the user (ff:User) must have a CareNeed (since they are the caregiver) via ff:caregiverInHousehold. The accompanied person (the one needing care) must have ff:hasInsurance [a ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance]. However, in SHACL, it's tricky to enforce that the accompanied person has this insurance because we have to traverse from the user to the CareNeed to the accompanied person. But maybe the user must have their own insurance, and the accompanied person's insurance is a separate condition. Wait, the first condition says both must be insured. So perhaps the user must have ff:hasInsurance [a ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance], and the accompanied person (the one being treated) also must have that. \n\n   But how to express the accompanied person's insurance in SHACL? Since SHACL constraints are on the user node (ff:User), maybe we can model this as: the user must be related to a CareNeed where the caregiver is them, and the CareNeed's patient (the accompanied person) has the required insurance. But I'm not sure how to model that in SHACL without using SPARQL, which isn't allowed here. Since SHACL Core doesn't allow complex path expressions beyond a few steps, maybe this needs to be simplified. Perhaps the user must have a caregiverInHousehold link to the CareNeed, and the CareNeed's patient (the accompanied person) must have the insurance. But I can't directly express that in SHACL Core. Maybe this is an oversight in the ontology, but given the constraints, perhaps we can only ensure that the user has the insurance, and the other conditions will handle the rest.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a relationship to the accompanied person (e.g., closeRelative or immediateCircleMember) and that person must have the insurance. But again, SHACL can't traverse that path in the shape. Maybe the user just needs to have the insurance themselves, and the accompanied person's insurance is inferred through other properties. This might be a limitation, but given the ontology, perhaps proceed with the user's own insurance.\n\n2. **The person being accompanied is being treated stationarily in a hospital.**\n   - \"Stationäre Behandlung\" implies that the person is inpatient. The ontology has ff:MedicalAccompaniment as a subclass of Event. Also, ff:inPatientCoAdmission is a data property on MedicalAccompaniment which is true if the person is admitted as an inpatient. Wait, the property is on MedicalAccompaniment. Wait, the MedicalAccompaniment is the event where the user is accompanying someone. The user is the caregiver (via ff:caregiverInHousehold to the CareNeed, which is part of the MedicalAccompaniment event? Maybe not. Alternatively, the MedicalAccompaniment event has the inPatientCoAdmission set to true.\n\n   The requirement says the accompanied person is being treated stationarily (inpatient). So the MedicalAccompaniment event must have ff:inPatientCoAdmission set to true. But how is the user connected to this event? The user is the caregiver in the CareNeed, which is linked via the MedicalAccompaniment event? Maybe the CareNeed is part of the MedicalAccompaniment? Alternatively, the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the accompanied person has? Hmm, perhaps the CareNeed is of type MedicalAccompaniment. Since CareNeed is a subclass of Event, and MedicalAccompaniment is also a subclass of Event, perhaps the CareNeed is an instance of MedicalAccompaniment. Therefore, the user's CareNeed (via caregiverInHousehold) must be a MedicalAccompaniment, and have ff:inPatientCoAdmission true. \n\n   So in SHACL, the user must have a CareNeed (object property) that is a MedicalAccompaniment (sh:hasClass) and has ff:inPatientCoAdmission = true.\n\n3. **The inpatient admission as a caregiver is medically necessary. Equivalent is full-day accompaniment (total time in hospital plus travel is at least 8 hours).**\n   - The MedicalAccompaniment must have ff:fullDayAccompaniment set to true. Because the note says \"Gleichgestellt ist eine ganztägige Begleitung\" which means \"equivalent is full-day accompaniment\", so if that's true, then it's considered medically necessary. The data property ff:fullDayAccompaniment on MedicalAccompaniment is exactly that. So the MedicalAccompaniment instance must have ff:fullDayAccompaniment = true.\n\n4. **The user has a loss of earnings.**\n   - The user must have an Event (triggering the loss) where ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true. Since the user's earning capacity might be affected, perhaps the ff:triggeringEvent of their EarningCapacity links to an event that causes loss. Alternatively, the user must have an event (e.g., the MedicalAccompaniment) that has ff:causesLossOfEarnings = true. \n\n   Looking at the ontology, ff:causesLossOfEarnings is a data property on ff:Event. So the user must have an event (maybe the MedicalAccompaniment) where this is true. Alternatively, the user's EarningCapacity's triggering event must have this. \n\n   Alternatively, the user must have an event that is the cause of their loss. Maybe the user has an EarningCapacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity) which is linked via ff:triggeringEvent to an event where ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true. \n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a property like ff:hasEvent where the event's ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true. The ontology has ff:hasEvent on Person, so that could work. So the user must have an event (via ff:hasEvent) where that event's ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true.\n\n5. **The user is a close relative or part of the immediate circle.**\n   - The user must be a close relative (ff:closeRelative) of the accompanied person, or part of their immediate circle (ff:immediateCircleMember). However, how to express that either one is true? Since SHACL has sh:or, perhaps we can have a constraint that the user has at least one of these relationships to the accompanied person. But again, the ontology may not allow expressing this without knowing the accompanied person's node. \n\n   Alternatively, maybe the user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember relationship to someone (the accompanied person), but in SHACL, since we can't traverse to the accompanied person, perhaps we can just require that the user has at least one of these properties. But that might not be precise, as it should be with the accompanied person. However, given the constraints, perhaps we can only enforce that the user has at least one closeRelative or immediateCircleMember link, assuming that it's to the correct person. \n\n6. **The accompanied person receives Integration Assistance (Eingliederungshilfe). The user does not receive the sick benefit from the health insurance if, for example, they are being paid for assisting. If accompanying in the context of Integration Assistance, costs are covered by the Integration Assistance providers.**\n   - The accompanied person must be receiving Integration Assistance (ff:IntegrationAssistance). So the accompanied person has ff:receivesBenefit [a ff:IntegrationAssistance]. But again, how to express this via the user's data? The user's CareNeed is linked to the accompanied person, so maybe through that path. \n\n   Alternatively, the user must have a relationship to the accompanied person who has ff:receivesBenefit [a ff:IntegrationAssistance]. But without knowing the accompanied person's node, perhaps the user must have a property indicating that the accompanied person is receiving this benefit. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for that, maybe we have to use the ff:hasEvent or another property. Alternatively, maybe the user's own ff:hasEmployment or other properties don't cover it. This might be tricky. The requirement says the accompanied person must receive Integration Assistance, so the user's data must include that the accompanied person is receiving it, but in SHACL, this would require a path to the accompanied person's data. Since SHACL Core can't do that, maybe this is an ambiguous condition that can't be modeled? But the problem says to not model ambiguous requirements. Alternatively, perhaps the user's own data includes a reference to the Integration Assistance being provided, but I'm not sure. \n\n   Alternatively, the Integration Assistance is part of the user's own data. Wait, the user is the caregiver, so maybe the Integration Assistance is a benefit the user is applying for, but no. The text says the accompanied person receives it. So perhaps this condition can't be modeled without linking to the accompanied person's data, which might be beyond SHACL Core's capabilities here. The user might not have that information in their own node. In that case, maybe this requirement is ambiguous or not modelable with the given ontology, so we should exclude it. \n\nBut the problem states not to model requirements that are ambiguous. Let me re-read the text again for this part. The text says the accompanied person must receive Integration Assistance. The user must not receive the benefit if they are being paid, but the Integration Assistance covers costs. So perhaps the Integration Assistance is a condition on the accompanied person. Since SHACL can't express that via the user's data unless there's a property linking to it, perhaps this is an ambiguous requirement that can't be assessed, so we should exclude it. However, the user might have a property indicating that the accompanied person is receiving it. For example, maybe the user has a property like ff:receivesBenefitFor or similar? Looking at the ontology, there's ff:receivesBenefit, but that's for the user themselves. The accompanied person must have ff:receivesBenefit [a ff:IntegrationAssistance]. To express this via the user's data, perhaps the user has a relationship to the accompanied person via ff:caregiverInHousehold (the CareNeed), and the CareNeed is linked to the accompanied person's needs, but I'm not sure how to model this in SHACL constraints. Since SHACL Core doesn't support SPARQL, maybe this is not possible, so we have to omit this condition as ambiguous.\n\nNow, compiling all the modelable conditions:\n\n1. User has ff:hasInsurance with a StatutoryHealthInsurance.\n2. The CareNeed (linked via caregiverInHousehold) is a MedicalAccompaniment with inPatientCoAdmission = true.\n3. The MedicalAccompaniment also has fullDayAccompaniment = true.\n4. User has an event (via ff:hasEvent) where causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n5. User is either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember of someone (the accompanied person, but we can only require that they have at least one such relationship).\n\nWait, but for condition 5, the user needs to be a close relative or in the immediate circle of the accompanied person. Since the ontology has ff:closeRelative and ff:immediateCircleMember as object properties from Person to Person, the user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember link to the accompanied person. However, the accompanied person is the one needing care, which is linked via the CareNeed. To express that the user's closeRelative or immediateCircleMember is the same as the accompanied person, but in SHACL, without variables, this is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the requirement cannot be fully modeled, so we have to model only that the user has at least one closeRelative or immediateCircleMember. But that's not sufficient, but maybe it's the best we can do.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember relationship, but the exact target is not specified. Since the ontology doesn't have a property that directly links the user to the accompanied person beyond the CareNeed and caregiverInHousehold, perhaps we can only ensure that the user has such a relationship in general, not specifically to the accompanied person. That might not be correct, but given the constraints, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accompanied person is linked via the CareNeed. Since the CareNeed's caregiver is the user, perhaps the CareNeed's patient (the accompanied person) must be a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember of the user. But in SHACL, you can't do that with Core components. Therefore, this condition might be ambiguous and not modelable, so we skip it. However, the user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, so maybe we can require that the user has at least one of those properties.\n\nWait, the fifth condition says the user must be a close relative or part of the immediate circle. So the user must have at least one of those relationships with the accompanied person, but since we can't specify the target, maybe the SHACL constraint can only require that the user has at least one closeRelative or immediateCircleMember link. Even if it's not the accompanied person, but the condition requires it to be, perhaps this is the best possible.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape for ff:User must have the following constraints:\n\n- has ff:hasInsurance with a StatutoryHealthInsurance (via sh:class)\n- has a CareNeed (ff:caregiverInHousehold) that is a MedicalAccompaniment and has both inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment true.\n- has an event (ff:hasEvent) that has causesLossOfEarnings true.\n- has either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember (sh:or between the two properties).\n\nNow, let's map each to SHACL:\n\nFirst, the user must be a person (ff:Person), so the shape starts with a targetClass.\n\nThe shape for the user:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:and (\n                [ sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:closeRelative ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:immediateCircleMember ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n    ]\n    .\n\nWait, but for the CareNeed part, the user is the caregiverInHousehold of the CareNeed. The CareNeed must be a MedicalAccompaniment (subclass of Event) and have both inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment set to true. \n\nWait, ff:caregiverInHousehold is an object property from CareNeed to Person (the caregiver). So the user (ff:User) has a ff:caregiverInHousehold relationship to the CareNeed? No, wait, the domain of ff:caregiverInHousehold is CareNeed, range is Person. So the CareNeed has a caregiverInHousehold (the user). Therefore, the user must have at least one CareNeed where they are the caregiver. Wait, no: the user is the range of the property. So the CareNeed has a caregiverInHousehold link to the user. To express that the user is a caregiver, the user must be the object of that property. But in SHACL, to express that the user has a CareNeed where they are the caregiver, you need to express that there exists a CareNeed where the user is its caregiver. Which would require a path like ff:caregiverInHousehold/owl:someValuesFrom, but SHACL doesn't have owl:someValuesFrom. Alternatively, the user must have at least one CareNeed where they are linked via the inverse property. But SHACL doesn't have inverse properties in core. \n\nThis is a problem. The user must be the caregiver (i.e., there exists a CareNeed where the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user). To express that in SHACL, since we can't do inverse paths, perhaps we need to model it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a CareNeed that is their caregiverInHousehold? That's not correct. Maybe the ontology has another way to link the user to the CareNeed? For example, the user has a needsCare relationship? Wait, the ontology says ff:needsCare is from Person to CareNeed (the person needing care). So the accompanied person has ff:needsCare to their CareNeed, and the CareNeed has ff:caregiverInHousehold to the user. \n\nTherefore, the user is the caregiver of the CareNeed linked to the accompanied person's needs. But in SHACL, the user can't directly access that CareNeed unless there's a path from the user. The user must have some relationship to that CareNeed. Since the user is the caregiverInHousehold of the CareNeed, but the CareNeed is linked via the accompanied person's needsCare, the user can't directly reference it unless there's a property from the user to the CareNeed. \n\nWait, maybe the user has a CareNeed via another property? The ontology doesn't list that. The only way the user is linked to the CareNeed is via the caregiverInHousehold property, but as the object. So the user is in the range of that property. \n\nThis is a problem because SHACL constraints are on the user node, and to express that there exists a CareNeed where the user is the caregiver, we need to express that the user is the object of that property in some triple. But SHACL can't do that without a path from the user's node. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the ontology might be insufficient to model this requirement properly, but perhaps we can make an assumption. Maybe the user has a CareNeed (as the one they are responsible for), but the domain of needsCare is Person, so the accompanied person has needsCare to the CareNeed, and the CareNeed has caregiverInHousehold to the user. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a property like ff:isCaregiverFor which links to the CareNeed, but that's not present in the ontology. \n\nGiven the ontology as provided, perhaps the user must have a CareNeed via some property, but there's no such property. Looking back:\n\nThe ontology's properties for Person include ff:hasEmployment, ff:hasDisabilityType, etc., but not directly a CareNeed. The CareNeed is linked via the accompanied person's needsCare. \n\nThis is a critical issue. Without a way to link the user to the CareNeed except through the inverse of caregiverInHousehold, which SHACL can't express, perhaps the constraint can't be properly modeled. This might mean that the condition is ambiguous or requires a property not present in the ontology, so we have to omit it? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's CareNeed is via a different property. Wait, maybe the user has a CareNeed via a different path. Let me check:\n\nThe CareNeed's domain is ff:Event, but it's an object property from CareNeed to Person (caregiverInHousehold). The user is the caregiver, so the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user. But how to express that the user has such a CareNeed? \n\nPerhaps the user must have a relationship via ff:caregiverInHousehold being the inverse of something, but SHACL can't do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a ff:hasCareNeed property, but that's not in the ontology. \n\nThis is a problem. Maybe the user's CareNeed is inferred through their employment or other properties, but it's unclear. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct way to express that the user is a caregiver, perhaps this condition can't be modeled with SHACL Core, making it ambiguous. However, the first condition about the CareNeed being MedicalAccompaniment and having those properties might still be possible if we can link to the CareNeed. \n\nWait, maybe the user has a CareNeed via the ff:caregiverInHousehold property? No, the property is from CareNeed to Person. So the user can't have a CareNeed via that property. \n\nThis is a major snag. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the ontology. Let me recheck:\n\nff:caregiverInHousehold has Domain: CareNeed, Range: Person. So a CareNeed can point to a Person (the caregiver). Therefore, to express that the user is a caregiver for at least one CareNeed which is a MedicalAccompaniment with those properties, we need a way to say that the user is in the range of that property for a MedicalAccompaniment. \n\nIn SHACL, this requires a shape that the user is the target of a triple where the subject is a MedicalAccompaniment and the predicate is ff:caregiverInHousehold. But how to express that the user is the object of such a triple. \n\nUsing SHACL's sh:targetShapes, maybe a shape for the CareNeed with the necessary constraints, and then have the user be the target of that shape's inverse. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this with a nested shape:\n\nThe user must have at least one CareNeed (but how?), but since the user can't directly have a CareNeed as an object property, this is impossible. \n\nHmm. Perhaps the user's CareNeed is linked via another property. Let me see:\n\nThe user is a Person, so maybe they have a needsCare property? No, needsCare is from Person to CareNeed, so that would be the accompanied person's needs. The caregiver is the user, so perhaps the user is the caregiver in the CareNeed linked to the accompanied person's needs. \n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the ontology is missing a property here, making the requirement impossible to model, thus we have to exclude this part. However, the user must have some way to indicate they're a caregiver, so maybe we'll have to assume that the user has a CareNeed via a different property, or perhaps the MedicalAccompaniment is directly linked to the user. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the user has via ff:hasEvent. Let me check:\n\nff:hasEvent has domain Person and CareNeed. So the user can have a ff:hasEvent which is a MedicalAccompaniment. That makes sense! The user has the MedicalAccompaniment event via ff:hasEvent. Because the user is the caregiver, perhaps the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the user participates in or has. \n\nAh! That could work. Because the MedicalAccompaniment is an event, and the user can have it via ff:hasEvent. Then the MedicalAccompaniment must have inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment set to true. \n\nThis seems plausible. So the user has an event (ff:hasEvent) that is a MedicalAccompaniment with the required properties. This way, we can model it:\n\n- The user has a MedicalAccompaniment event (via ff:hasEvent), which must be of that class and have the two data properties set to true.\n\nThis bypasses the CareNeed issue and directly uses the MedicalAccompaniment as the user's event. That might be the intended way.\n\nSo adjusting the constraints:\n\nFor condition 2 and 3:\n\nThe user must have a MedicalAccompaniment event (via ff:hasEvent) that is a MedicalAccompaniment, and has inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment both true.\n\nThat makes it possible with SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n        sh:and (\n            [ sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ]\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ]\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ]\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but the user's hasEvent must have this MedicalAccompaniment. So that's a better approach.\n\nThis way, the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the user has, which covers the stationäre Behandlung and the full-day requirement.\n\nThat seems manageable.\n\nThen, for the first condition, the user must have ff:hasInsurance with StatutoryHealthInsurance. \n\nThe fifth condition (closeRelative or immediateCircle) can be modeled as requiring at least one of those properties.\n\nThe fourth condition requires an event (the MedicalAccompaniment itself?) that causes loss of earnings. Wait, the event causing the loss could be the MedicalAccompaniment. So the same MedicalAccompaniment event must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings true. \n\nWait, the MedicalAccompaniment is already being used for conditions 2-3. So combining these:\n\nThe MedicalAccompaniment event (the user's hasEvent) must also have ff:causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nThus, the MedicalAccompaniment node must have all three properties: inPatientCoAdmission, fullDayAccompaniment, and causesLossOfEarnings.\n\nWait, but ff:causesLossOfEarnings is a data property on Event, which MedicalAccompaniment is a subclass of. So yes.\n\nSo the shape for the MedicalAccompaniment node would have those three properties.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User requires:\n\n- has ff:hasInsurance [a ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance]\n\n- has at least one ff:hasEvent which is a MedicalAccompaniment with:\n\n   - inPatientCoAdmission true\n\n   - fullDayAccompaniment true\n\n   - causesLossOfEarnings true\n\n- and has either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember link.\n\nWait, but the fourth condition says the user has a loss of earnings, which is caused by the event (MedicalAccompaniment), so the MedicalAccompaniment must have causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nThus, the MedicalAccompaniment must have all three properties.\n\nNow, the fifth condition (being close relative or immediate circle):\n\nThe user must have at least one of ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember. So in SHACL, a sh:or constraint on those properties.\n\nPutting all together in Turtle:\n\n<@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:and (\n                [ sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ]\n                [ sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                    sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:closeRelative ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:immediateCircleMember ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n    ]\n    .\n\nWait, but the fourth condition's event causing loss is now included in the MedicalAccompaniment's properties.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, check all conditions:\n\n1.
