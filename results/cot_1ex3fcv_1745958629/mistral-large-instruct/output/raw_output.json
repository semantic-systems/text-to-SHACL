The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente (DE) / Statutory accident insurance widow's pension (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_582441\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to a widow's and widower's pension for surviving dependants under the following conditions\nwidower's pension for surviving dependants:\n\n  * Death of the (spouse) partner as a result of an insurance event: \n    * Accident at work,\n    * commuting accident or\n    * occupational disease\n  * You were already living in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership in accordance with the Civil Partnership Act.\n\nAs a rule, you are not entitled if\n\n  * you only entered into the marriage or civil partnership after the insured event and\n  * the death occurred within the first year of this marriage or civil partnership.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User's spouse OR civil partner died (GREEN).\n2. The deceased person had statutory accident insurance [1] (GREEN).\n3. The person's death was caused by an insurance event (YELLOW: definition of the terms in a legal sense must be inferred or explained):\n\t- accident at work OR\n\t- a commuting accident OR\n\t- a recognized occupational disease.\n4. User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event (GREEN).\n5. Typically, the death may not have occurred within the first year of marriage or the registered partnership (RED: ambiguous qualifier \"Typically\").\n\n[1] Not explicitly mentioned in the requirements text, but implied by the benefit's name and \"insurance event\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

Lebensjahr noch nicht vollendet hat,\n  * Sie vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung (zum Beispiel Krankengeld, Arbeitslosengeld) hatten und\n  * keine andere in Ihrem Haushalt lebende Person Ihr Kind betreuen kann.\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld (DE) / Statutory accident insurance child injury benefit (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102799515\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to child injury benefit if:\n\n  * you have to supervise, look after or care for a child in your household due to the consequences of an insured event (school and kindergarten accident),\n  * your child has not yet reached the age of 12,\n  * you were entitled to a wage or other cash benefit (e.g. sickness benefit, unemployment benefit) before you supervised, looked after or cared for your child and\n  * no other person living in your household can look after your child.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User lives in the same household with at least one child (GREEN) that meets the following requirements:\n    - the child needs care [1] (YELLOW: Definition of need for care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred) AND\n    - the child is younger than 12 years (GREEN) AND\n\n2. The child's care needs were caused by a school accident OR a kindergarten accident (YELLOW: Definition of \"school accident\" and \"kindergarten accident\" in a legal sense must be inferred or explained)\n\n4. The user was entitled to a cash benefit like salary or unemployment benefit before the child's care needs started (YELLOW: which cash benefits qualify is not exhaustively clarified in the requirements text and must be inferred or explained)\n\n5. No other member of the household can provide the needed care (YELLOW: Under what conditions a household member \"can\" provide the care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred).\n\n[1] Distinction between supervision, care and nursing is unclear. Hence, simplified to \"care\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799515 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance child injury benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVKinderverletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102799515 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User lives in the same household with at least one child that meets the requirements\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User lives in the same household with at least one child that meets the requirements.'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # The child needs care\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:CareNeedsShape ;\n    ] ;\n    # The child is younger than 12 years\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 12 ;\n    ] .\n\nff:CareNeedsShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # The child's care needs were caused by a school accident OR a kindergarten accident\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:SchoolAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:KindergartenAccident ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    # The user was entitled to a cash benefit before the child's care needs started\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User\n    ] ;\n    # No other member of the household can provide the needed care\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User)\n    ] .\n\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Kindergeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_576986.\nVoraussetzungen, die für Sie als Eltern gelten:\n\n  * Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Citizen benefit\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_102799525.\n  * Sie müssen einen Anspruch auf Hinterbliebenenleistung aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung haben.\n  * Sie haben wiedergeheiratet oder eine neue Lebenspartnerschaft nach dem Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz begründet.\n\nSOLUTION:\n",

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Insolvenzgeld (DE) / Insolvency allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_576848\nRequirements text (EN): In order for you to receive insolvency allowance, certain requirements must be\nmust be met:\n\n  * There is an insolvency event if\n    * Insolvency proceedings are opened against the assets of your employer or\n    * insolvency application is rejected due to lack of assets or\n    * Business operations are completely discontinued due to obvious lack of assets.\n  * You have not been paid for up to 3 months prior to the insolvency event.\n  * As an employee you are \n    * employed within Germany or\n    * have been temporarily posted abroad while retaining the obligation to pay social insurance in Germany.\n  * You must prove that you are legally considered an employee by means of a notification from the German Pension Insurance Clearing Office (status determination procedure) if, for example, you are a\n    * managing partner,\n    * shareholder of a limited liability company or\n    * relative of the employer.\n  * Further information can be found on the website of the Federal Employment Agency.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. An insolvency event occurred:\n\t- Insolvency proceedings are opened against the employer's assets (GREEN) OR\n\t- An insolvency application is rejected for lack of assets (GREEN) OR\n\t- Business activity is completely discontinued AND there is an obvious lack of assets (GREEN)\n2. User wage was cut within 3 months before the insolvency event (GREEN)\n3. User is \n  - employed in Germany (GREEN) OR \n  - employed abroad AND subject to social security in Germany (GREEN) (Note: the temporary nature of the posting can be presumed if employment abroad plus social security in Germany, see [1])\n4. User is an employee (GREEN)\n5. If the user is, for example, a managing partner, shareholder of a limited liability company or a relative of the employer, they must prove that they are an employee with a notice from the clearing office (RED: \"for example\" - rule under defined)\n\n[1] SGB 4 §4: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_4/__4.html\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_576848 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # An insolvency event occurred\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeB\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeC\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'An insolvency event occurred at the user's employer'.\"@en ;\n\t] ;\n    # User is employed in Germany OR temporarily abroad and subject to social security in Germany\n    sh:or (\n        ff:CountryShapeA\n        ff:CountryShapeB\n    )  ;\n    # User is an employee by law\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Employee) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User is an employee by law'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# Insolvency proceedings are opened against the employer's assets\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n            sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n        ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\n# Insolvency application was rejected for lack of assets\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n            sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n        ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\n# Business activity is completely discontinued AND there is an obvious lack of assets\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeC a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    ] .\n\n# User wage was cut within 3 months before the insolvency event\nff:WageCutShape a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n    sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n    sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User wage was cut within 3 months before the insolvency event'.\"@en .\n\n# User is employed in Germany\nff:CountryShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n\n# User is employed abroad AND subject to social security in Germany\nff:CountryShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Germany)\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582422.\n  * Bei Ihnen liegt ein Arbeits oder Wegeunfall oder eine anerkannte Berufskrankheit vor.\n  * Sie nehmen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben teil (berufliche Reha).\n\nSOLUTION:\n",

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Kinderzuschlag (DE) / Child supplement (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_581863\nRequirements text (EN): To receive a child supplement, the following requirements must be met:\n\n  * Your child/children is/are younger than 25, not married or partnered and lives in your household.\n  * You receive child benefit or a comparable benefit for your child/children, for example from abroad.\n  * You have \n    * as a couple, a joint gross income of at least EUR 900.00 per month (excluding housing benefit, child benefit and child supplement) or\n    * as a single parent at least EUR 600.00 per month.\n  * Your income, which is offset against the child supplement, is not so high that the child supplement is reduced to zero.\n  * You do not have any significant assets.\n  * As a rule, you can receive the child supplement if your income, child benefit, any housing benefit to which you may be entitled and the child supplement can cover the needs of the whole family within the meaning of SGB II.\n  * Child supplement is subordinate to other possible income of the child; there may be an obligation to apply for priority claims such as maintenance or advance maintenance payments.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User receives child benefit for at least one child (GREEN) that also  \n  - is younger than 25 years (GREEN) AND\n  - is not married or in a registered partnership (GREEN) AND\n  - lives in the same household as the user. (GREEN)\n  - is not eligible for other benefits with priority over child supplement. (YELLOW: which benefits have priority over child supplement and whether the child is eligible must be inferred or explained)\n7. With their partner, the user's shared gross income is at least 900€/Month. (GREEN)\n8. As a single parent, the user's gross income is at least 600€/Month. (GREEN)\n9. User income that will be offset against child supplement does not reduce child supplement to zero. (YELLOW: how user income is offset against child supplement must be inferred or explained)\n10. User has no considerable assets. (YELLOW: meaning of considerable assets must be inferred or explained, definition see [1])\n11. Typically, user is eligible if their income, child allowance, housing benefit, and child supplement can cover the household needs according to SGB II.

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Citizen benefit\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_102716305.\nSie haben im Regelfall Anspruch auf Übergangsgeld, wenn folgende Bedingungen\nauf Sie zutreffen:\n\n  * Sie haben eine Behinderung und benötigen deshalb eine besondere Unterstützung bei der Eingliederung in das Berufsleben.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Kinderzuschlag (DE) / Child supplement (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_581863\nRequirements text (EN): To receive a child supplement, the following requirements must be met:\n\n  * Your child/children is/are younger than 25, not married or partnered and lives in your household.\n  * You receive child benefit or a comparable benefit for your child/children, for example from abroad.\n  * You have \n    * as a couple, a joint gross income of at least EUR 900.00 per month (excluding housing benefit, child benefit and child supplement) or\n    * as a single parent at least EUR 600.00 per month.\n  * Your income, which is offset against the child supplement, is not so high that the child supplement is reduced to zero.\n  * You do not have any significant assets.\n  * As a rule, you can receive the child supplement if your income, child benefit, any housing benefit to which you may be entitled and the child supplement can cover the needs of the whole family within the meaning of SGB II.\n  * Child supplement is subordinate to other possible income of the child; there may be an obligation to apply for priority claims such as maintenance or advance maintenance payments.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User receives child benefit for at least one child (GREEN) that also  \n  - is younger than 25 years (GREEN) AND\n  - is not married or in a registered partnership (GREEN) AND\n  - lives in the same household as the user. (GREEN)\n  - is not eligible for other benefits with priority over child supplement. (YELLOW: which benefits have priority over child supplement and whether the child is eligible must be inferred or explained)\n7. With their partner, the user's shared gross income is at least 900€/Month. (GREEN)\n8. As a single parent, the user's gross income is at least 600€/Month. (GREEN)\n9. User income that will be offset against child supplement does not reduce child supplement to zero. (YELLOW: how user income is offset against child supplement must be inferred or explained)\n10. User has no considerable assets. (YELLOW: meaning of considerable assets must be inferred or explained, definition see [1])\n11. Typically, user is eligible if their income, child allowance, housing benefit, and child supplement can cover the household needs according to SGB II. (RED: ambiguous qualifier \"typically\")\n\n[1] SGB 2 § 12: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_2/__12.html\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Citizen benefit\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Bürgergeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_106311931.\n  * Sie sind erwerbsfähig.

step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld (DE) / Statutory accident insurance injury allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_582429\nRequirements text (EN):  * You will receive injury benefit from the statutory accident insurance if you are unable to work due to an insurance event.\n  * Accidents at work, commuting accidents and occupational illnesses are deemed to be insurance events.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User has statutory accident insurance [1] (GREEN)\n2. User is unfit for work (YELLOW: \"unfit for work\" in a legal sense must be inferred or explained)\n3. The unfitness for work was caused by an insurance event (YELLOW: definition of the terms in a legal sense must be inferred or explained):\n\t- accident at work OR\n\t- a commuting accident OR\n\t- a recognized occupational disease.\n\n[1] Not explicitly mentioned in the requirements text, but implied by the benefit's name and \"insurance event\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582429 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance injury allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVVerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582429 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User has statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has statutory accident insurance'\"@en\n    ] ;\n     # User is unfit for work\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:UnfitForWork ) ;\n        sh:node ff:CapacityReductionShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has reduced earning capacity'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:CapacityReductionShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # User is unfit for work because of an insurance event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] # Arbeitsunfall\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ] # Wegeunfall\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ] # Berufskrankheit\n        )\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582429.\n  * Sie erhalten Verletztengeld aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung, wenn Sie aufgrund eines Versicherungsfalls arbeitsunfähig sind.\n  * Als Versicherungsfälle gelten Arbeits- und Wegeunfälle sowie Berufskrankheiten.\n\nSOLUTION:\n",

Lebensjahr noch nicht vollendet hat,\n  * Sie vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung (zum Beispiel Krankengeld, Arbeitslosengeld) hatten und\n  * keine andere in Ihrem Haushalt lebende Person Ihr Kind betreuen kann.\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld (DE) / Statutory accident insurance child injury benefit (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102799515\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to child injury benefit if:\n\n  * you have to supervise, look after or care for a child in your household due to the consequences of an insured event (school and kindergarten accident),\n  * your child has not yet reached the age of 12,\n  * you were entitled to a wage or other cash benefit (e.g. sickness benefit, unemployment benefit) before you supervised, looked after or cared for your child and\n  * no other person living in your household can look after your child.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User lives in the same household with at least one child (GREEN) that meets the following requirements:\n    - the child needs care [1] (YELLOW: Definition of need for care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred) AND\n    - the child is younger than 12 years (GREEN) AND\n\n2. The child's care needs were caused by a school accident OR a kindergarten accident (YELLOW: Definition of \"school accident\" and \"kindergarten accident\" in a legal sense must be inferred or explained)\n\n4. The user was entitled to a cash benefit like salary or unemployment benefit before the child's care needs started (YELLOW: which cash benefits qualify is not exhaustively clarified in the requirements text and must be inferred or explained)\n\n5. No other member of the household can provide the needed care (YELLOW: Under what conditions a household member \"can\" provide the care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred).\n\n[1] Distinction between supervision, care and nursing is unclear. Hence, simplified to \"care\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Citizen benefit\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582404.\nWenn Sie gesetzlich unfallversichert sind, haben Sie unter folgenden\nVoraussetzungen Anspruch auf Rente:\n\n  * Ihre Erwerbsfähigkeit ist gemindert: \n    * infolge eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle,\n    * über die 26.

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente (DE) / Statutory accident insurance widow's pension (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_582441\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to a widow's and widower's pension for surviving dependants under the following conditions\nwidower's pension for surviving dependants:\n\n  * Death of the (spouse) partner as a result of an insurance event: \n    * Accident at work,\n    * commuting accident or\n    * occupational disease\n  * You were already living in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership in accordance with the Civil Partnership Act.\n\nAs a rule, you are not entitled if\n\n  * you only entered into the marriage or civil partnership after the insured event and\n  * the death occurred within the first year of this marriage or civil partnership.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User's spouse OR civil partner died (GREEN).\n2. The deceased person had statutory accident insurance [1] (GREEN).\n3. The person's death was caused by an insurance event (YELLOW: definition of the terms in a legal sense must be inferred or explained):\n\t- accident at work OR\n\t- a commuting accident OR\n\t- a recognized occupational disease.\n4. User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event (GREEN).\n5. Typically, the death may not have occurred within the first year of marriage or the registered partnership (RED: ambiguous qualifier \"Typically\").\n\n[1] Not explicitly mentioned in the requirements text, but implied by the benefit's name and \"insurance event\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance widow's pension\"@en .\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVWitwenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582441 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User's spouse OR civil partner died \n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n    ) .\n\nff:DeceasedPartnerShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n     # The deceased partner had statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Dceased person has statutory accident insurance'\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:InsuranceEventShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Death was caused by an insurance event' or 'User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:InsuranceEventShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Death was caused by an insurance event\n    sh:or (\n            [sh:class ff:WorkAccident]\n            [sh:class ff:CommutingAccident]\n            [sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease]\n     ) ;\n    # User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582441.\nSie haben unter folgenden Voraussetzungen einen Anspruch auf die Witwen- und\nWitwerrente für Hinterbliebene:\n\n  * Tod der (Ehe-)Partnerin oder des (Ehe-)Partners infolge eines Versicherungsfalles: \n    * Arbeitsunfall,\n    * Wegeunfall oder\n    * Berufskrankheit\n  * Sie haben schon davor in einer rechtsgültigen Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft nach dem Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz gelebt.\n\nSie haben in der Regel keinen Anspruch, wenn\n\n  * Sie die Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft erst nach dem Versicherungsfall geschlossen haben und\n  * der Tod innerhalb des ersten Jahres dieser Ehe oder Lebenspartnerschaft eingetreten ist.\n\nSOLUTION:\n",

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Citizen benefit\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Arbeitslosengeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_576842.\nSie haben Anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld, wenn\n\n  * Sie arbeitslos sind, das heißt,\n    * Sie stehen nicht in einem Beschäftigungsverhältnis oder\n    * Sie üben nur eine Erwerbstätigkeit in einem Umfang von weniger als 15 Stunden wöchentlich aus und\n    * Sie stehen den Vermittlungsbemühungen der Agentur für Arbeit zur Verfügung.

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung (DE) / Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102717659\nRequirements text (EN): * You have a severe visual or hearing impairment or are at risk of such a disability.\n* Your responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency.\n* Your prospects of participating in working life or participating in working life again are significantly reduced not only temporarily due to the nature and severity of your disability and you therefore need help to participate in working life.\n* You are willing to undergo vocational training or be integrated into the labor market in some other way.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User has a disability OR is at risk of a disability (GREEN).\n2. The disability is a visual OR hearing impairment (GREEN).\n3. The disability is severe (YELLOW: Meaning of severe in a legal sense must be explained or inferred).\n4. User's rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (GREEN).\n5. The disability reduces the user's prospect of participating in working life permanently (GREEN) AND significantly (RED: Likely discretionary)\n6. Because of their disability, the user needs support with their integration into the workforce (GREEN).\n7.

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Insolvenzgeld (DE) / Insolvency allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_576848\nRequirements text (EN): In order for you to receive insolvency allowance, certain requirements must be\nmust be met:\n\n  * There is an insolvency event if\n    * Insolvency proceedings are opened against the assets of your employer or\n    * insolvency application is rejected due to lack of assets or\n    * Business operations are completely discontinued due to obvious lack of assets.\n  * You have not been paid for up to 3 months prior to the insolvency event.\n  * As an employee you are \n    * employed within Germany or\n    * have been temporarily posted abroad while retaining the obligation to pay social insurance in Germany.\n  * You must prove that you are legally considered an employee by means of a notification from the German Pension Insurance Clearing Office (status determination procedure) if, for example, you are a\n    * managing partner,\n    * shareholder of a limited liability company or\n    * relative of the employer.\n  * Further information can be found on the website of the Federal Employment Agency.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. An insolvency event occurred:\n\t- Insolvency proceedings are opened against the employer's assets (GREEN) OR\n\t- An insolvency application is rejected for lack of assets (GREEN) OR\n\t- Business activity is completely discontinued AND there is an obvious lack of assets (GREEN)\n2. User wage was cut within 3 months before the insolvency event (GREEN)\n3. User is \n  - employed in Germany (GREEN) OR \n  - employed abroad AND subject to social security in Germany (GREEN) (Note: the temporary nature of the posting can be presumed if employment abroad plus social security in Germany, see [1])\n4. User is an employee (GREEN)\n5. If the user is, for example, a managing partner, shareholder of a limited liability company or a relative of the employer, they must prove that they are an employee with a notice from the clearing office (RED: \"for example\" - rule under defined)\n\n[1] SGB 4 §4: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_4/__4.html\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY
