The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente (DE) / Statutory accident insurance widow's pension (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_582441\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to a widow's and widower's pension for surviving dependants under the following conditions\nwidower's pension for surviving dependants:\n\n  * Death of the (spouse) partner as a result of an insurance event: \n    * Accident at work,\n    * commuting accident or\n    * occupational disease\n  * You were already living in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership in accordance with the Civil Partnership Act.\n\nAs a rule, you are not entitled if\n\n  * you only entered into the marriage or civil partnership after the insured event and\n  * the death occurred within the first year of this marriage or civil partnership.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User's spouse OR civil partner died (GREEN).\n2. The deceased person had statutory accident insurance [1] (GREEN).\n3. The person's death was caused by an insurance event (YELLOW: definition of the terms in a legal sense must be inferred or explained):\n\t- accident at work OR\n\t- a commuting accident OR\n\t- a recognized occupational disease.\n4. User was married OR lived in a civil union with the deceased person prior to the insured event (GREEN).\n5. Typically, the death may not have occurred within the first year of marriage or the registered partnership (RED: ambiguous qualifier \"Typically\").\n\n[1] Not explicitly mentioned in the requirements text, but implied by the benefit's name and \"insurance event\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Einstiegsgeld' (Introductory Allowance) based on the given conditions. First, I need to parse the requirements provided in German and map them to the ontology terms.\n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, they translated the requirements into English and categorized them as GREEN (include) or RED (exclude). I'll follow that approach here. \n\nStarting with the main conditions:\n\n1. \"Sie erhalten vor Aufnahme Ihrer neuen Tätigkeit Bürgergeld.\" – This means the user must receive Citizen Benefit (Bürgergeld) before starting their new job. The example included this as GREEN because it's a direct check on the user's current benefits. The ontology has an individual for Bürgergeld: ff:B100019_LB_106311931. So, I need a SHACL constraint ensuring the user has this benefit via ff:receivesBenefit.\n\n2. \"Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit stellen.\" – Submitting the application before starting the job. But how to model this in SHACL? The application submission is an action, not data present in the RDF graph. Since the graph only contains user data, this might be a RED condition as it depends on the application timing, which isn't part of the user's static data. So exclude.\n\n3. \"Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Beschäftigung ist geeignet...\" – The new activity must help overcome their need for assistance. \"Geeignet\" (suitable) is subjective and requires an assessment. Third-party discretion, so RED.\n\n4. \"Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Eingliederung erforderlich.\" – Necessity for integration is ambiguous, so RED.\n\n5. \"Mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\" – The employment must be at least 15 hours/week. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. But the user's current employment status isn't the focus here (they might be unemployed but planning to start). The requirement is about the new job, but if the employment hasn't started yet, the data might not exist. Wait, the first condition requires they are receiving Bürgergeld, implying they might be unemployed. The new employment's hours would be part of their future job, which might not be in the user's data yet. So this might be unverifiable with current data, making it ambiguous. Hence, RED.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment:\n\n- Jobcenter's positive assessment on personal suitability and economic viability. Both are third-party evaluations, so RED.\n\nSo the only GREEN condition is receiving Bürgergeld. The SHACL shape must enforce that the user has ff:B100019_LB_106311931 via ff:receivesBenefit. The example's solution uses sh:hasValue to check for that. Also, the shape should target ff:User.\n\nWait, in the example's solution, they used sh:hasValue with the citizen benefit. But in SHACL, sh:hasValue is for exact matches. So the user's graph must have a triple where User ff:receivesBenefit the Bürgergeld individual. That seems right.\n\nI should also structure the shape correctly. The shape is named after the benefit, and the targetNode is ff:User. The property constraint checks for the presence of the required benefit.\n\nLet me check the ontology again to confirm the properties. The ff:receivesBenefit is an object property from Person to SocialBenefit. So yes, the User (ff:Person) must have a ff:receivesBenefit link to Bürgergeld.\n\nNo other conditions are GREEN. So the SHACL graph will only include this one constraint.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld\n        sh:message \"User must currently receive Bürgergeld before eligibility.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

Lebensjahr noch nicht vollendet hat,\n  * Sie vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung (zum Beispiel Krankengeld, Arbeitslosengeld) hatten und\n  * keine andere in Ihrem Haushalt lebende Person Ihr Kind betreuen kann.\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld (DE) / Statutory accident insurance child injury benefit (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102799515\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to child injury benefit if:\n\n  * you have to supervise, look after or care for a child in your household due to the consequences of an insured event (school and kindergarten accident),\n  * your child has not yet reached the age of 12,\n  * you were entitled to a wage or other cash benefit (e.g. sickness benefit, unemployment benefit) before you supervised, looked after or cared for your child and\n  * no other person living in your household can look after your child.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User lives in the same household with at least one child (GREEN) that meets the following requirements:\n    - the child needs care [1] (YELLOW: Definition of need for care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred) AND\n    - the child is younger than 12 years (GREEN) AND\n\n2. The child's care needs were caused by a school accident OR a kindergarten accident (YELLOW: Definition of \"school accident\" and \"kindergarten accident\" in a legal sense must be inferred or explained)\n\n4. The user was entitled to a cash benefit like salary or unemployment benefit before the child's care needs started (YELLOW: which cash benefits qualify is not exhaustively clarified in the requirements text and must be inferred or explained)\n\n5. No other member of the household can provide the needed care (YELLOW: Under what conditions a household member \"can\" provide the care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred).\n\n[1] Distinction between supervision, care and nursing is unclear. Hence, simplified to \"care\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799515 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance child injury benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVKinderverletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102799515 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User lives in the same household with at least one child that meets the requirements\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User lives in the same household with at least one child that meets the requirements.'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # The child needs care\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:CareNeedsShape ;\n    ] ;\n    # The child is younger than 12 years\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 12 ;\n    ] .\n\nff:CareNeedsShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # The child's care needs were caused by a school accident OR a kindergarten accident\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:SchoolAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:KindergartenAccident ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    # The user was entitled to a cash benefit before the child's care needs started\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:wasEntitledToCashBenefitBefore ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User\n    ] ;\n    # No other member of the household can provide the needed care\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User)\n    ] .\n\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Kindergeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_576986.\nVoraussetzungen, die für Sie als Eltern gelten:\n\n  * Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph problem. The user wants me to create a SHACL graph based on the given social benefit description. The benefit in question is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' with the IDLB B100019_LB_102799525. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the requirements from the text provided. The text is in German, so I'll start by translating it to understand the conditions. The two main points are:\n\n1. The user must have a claim to a survivors' benefit from statutory accident insurance.\n2. The user has remarried or entered into a new civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act after the death of their spouse or civil partner.\n\nNext, I need to check the ontology provided to see which classes, properties, and individuals are available to represent these conditions. \n\nStarting with the first condition: \"Sie müssen einen Anspruch auf Hinterbliebenenleistung aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung haben.\" \n\nTranslating this, it means the user must have a claim to survivors' benefit from statutory accident insurance. Looking at the ontology, there's an individual ff:B100019_LB_102716305 labeled as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance,\" but I need to confirm if that's the correct one. Wait, the user's benefit is 'Rentenabfindung', which might be different. Alternatively, maybe the survivors' benefit is part of the statutory accident insurance. The ontology has ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an instance of ff:Insurance. \n\nThe requirement here is that the user has a claim (i.e., is eligible) for this benefit. The ontology has the property ff:isEligibleFor which links a person to a social benefit. So the first condition would require that the user has an isEligibleFor relationship to the specific survivors' benefit. However, the exact social benefit instance for survivors' benefit isn't listed here. Wait, looking at the individual entries, there's ff:B100019_LB_102716305 which is labeled \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld\" which is the transitional allowance, but maybe the survivors' benefit is another one. Alternatively, perhaps the benefit in question here (B100019_LB_102799525) itself is the survivors' benefit. Hmm, the problem states that the benefit's name is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung', so maybe the survivors' benefit claim is a prerequisite. Wait, the user must have a claim to that specific benefit. \n\nWait, the user's benefit (Rentenabfindung) requires that they have a claim on a survivors' benefit from statutory accident insurance. So perhaps the survivors' benefit is another social benefit. Looking at the ontology's social benefits, there's ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (transitional allowance) and others like ff:B100019_LB_576842 (child allowance), but maybe there's a missing one. Alternatively, maybe the 'Hinterbliebenenleistung' is part of the statutory accident insurance's offerings. Since the ontology includes ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an insurance type, perhaps the eligibility is linked through having that insurance and meeting certain conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the first condition might be modeled as the user having a claim (isEligibleFor) to the survivors' benefit. Since the exact social benefit isn't listed in the ontology's individuals, maybe we need to represent it through another property. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner, and thus qualifies for the survivors' benefit. \n\nLet me think again. The first condition says the user must have a claim on the survivors' benefit from statutory accident insurance. The survivors' benefit here would be part of the statutory accident insurance's benefits. The ontology has the ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an insurance instance. So maybe the user must have that insurance (via ff:hasInsurance) and also have a deceased spouse/partner. \n\nWait, but the requirement is that the user has a claim to the survivors' benefit. To model that, perhaps the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner (using ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner) because that's a common requirement for survivors' benefits. Additionally, they must have the relevant insurance. \n\nAlternatively, the ontology might have a property indicating eligibility for a specific benefit. But since the exact benefit isn't listed, maybe we need to use the ff:isEligibleFor property pointing to a survivors' benefit. However, since it's not in the ontology, perhaps we can't model that directly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the survivors' benefit claim is implied by having a deceased spouse/partner and the correct insurance. Let me check the ontology again for properties related to deceased partners. \n\nLooking at the object properties: there's ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner, both linking a person to another person who died as their spouse or civil partner. So to have a claim on the survivors' benefit, the user must have such a deceased partner. \n\nTherefore, the first condition can be represented by requiring that the user has at least one of these deceased relationships. \n\nThe second condition: \"Sie haben wiedergeheiratet oder eine neue Lebenspartnerschaft nach dem Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz begründet.\" Translating to \"You have remarried or entered into a new civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act after the death of your spouse or civil partner.\" \n\nSo after the death of their previous spouse or civil partner, they remarried or formed a new civil union. \n\nThe ontology has the property ff:maritalStatus which links to ff:MaritalStatus instances. For example, ff:Married and ff:CivilUnion are marital statuses. However, the requirement specifies that this new union happened after the death. \n\nThe ontology also has the property ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood, which is a data property of the marital status (ff:MaritalStatus) that is true if a widowed person remarried or entered a new civil union. \n\nWait, checking the data properties: \n\nff:newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property with domain ff:MaritalStatus and range xsd:boolean. So if the user's marital status has this property set to true, that indicates they formed a new union after being widowed. \n\nTherefore, the second condition can be modeled by requiring that the user's marital status has ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe user must have:\n\n1. A deceased spouse or civil partner (via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner), which implies eligibility for the survivors' benefit. \n\n2. Their marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood property set to true. \n\nAdditionally, they must have the relevant insurance (statutory accident insurance) perhaps. Wait, the first condition says \"aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung\" which means from the statutory accident insurance. So the user must have that insurance. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the property ff:hasInsurance links a person to an insurance they have. So requiring that they have ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance (an individual in the ontology) via ff:hasInsurance. \n\nTherefore, the three conditions are:\n\n- The user has ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner (at least one)\n- The user's marital status has ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood = true\n- The user has ff:hasInsurance pointing to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance\n\nWait, but the first condition is about having a claim to the survivors' benefit, which might require not only the deceased partner but also the insurance. \n\nSo, the SHACL constraints should enforce:\n\n- User must have at least one of ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner (i.e., either one exists)\n- User must have a marital status that has the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true\n- User must have the statutory accident insurance (ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance)\n\nAdditionally, the marital status must be their current marital status. \n\nNow, checking the ontology:\n\nThe marital status is linked via ff:hasMaritalStatus. So the user must have a ff:hasMaritalStatus link to a marital status instance (like ff:Married or ff:CivilUnion?), and that instance must have ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood true. \n\nWait, the property ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property of the marital status instance. So the marital status (the object of ff:hasMaritalStatus) must have that property set to true. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape for the marital status condition would need to check that the value of ff:hasMaritalStatus has the newUnionAfterWidowhood property as true. \n\nPutting this into SHACL components:\n\nFor the deceased spouse/civil partner:\n\nUse sh:path to either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner, and require that at least one exists (sh:minCount 1). \n\nFor the marital status condition:\n\nsh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus, and then sh:hasValue with a node that has the newUnionAfterWidowhood true. Wait, no, because the marital status node itself must have that property. Alternatively, use sh:property to check the property on the target node. \n\nAlternatively, use sh:property on the hasMaritalStatus path to check for the existence of the newUnionAfterWidowhood being true. \n\nWait, in SHACL, to express that the object of hasMaritalStatus has the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true, you can use a nested property path or a nested property constraint. \n\nAlternatively, you can use a sh:property with sh:path as the data property and sh:hasValue true. \n\nWait, here's an approach:\n\nThe shape for the marital status condition would have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood;\n        sh:minIn 1;\n        sh:hasValue true;\n    ]\n]\n\nThis ensures that the user has a marital status (so minCount 1 on hasMaritalStatus), and that the marital status instance has newUnionAfterWidowhood = true. \n\nFor the insurance condition:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance;\n]\n\nThis requires that the user has at least one hasInsurance link to the statutory accident insurance individual. \n\nNow, putting all these together into the SHACL shape for the benefit's eligibility:\n\nThe SHACL shape will target the ff:User node, and have properties for each of these conditions. \n\nAdditionally, the benefit's individual must be defined. The benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102799525, which isn't listed in the ontology's individuals, but perhaps it's a new one. Wait, the examples show that the benefit's individual is defined in the ontology. Looking back:\n\nIn the ontology's individuals, there is:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102716305 (Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance)\nBut the current benefit is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung', which might not be listed. Hmm, the user's task is to model the conditions for this benefit, so even if the ontology doesn't have an individual for it yet, we can create it in the SHACL graph. \n\nWait the problem says \"the social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph\" so we need to define the benefit's individual in the SHACL output. \n\nSo in the SHACL, first declare the benefit individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance pension settlement\"@en .\n\nThen, the shape for the benefit's eligibility would be:\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\nff:Rentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1: deceased spouse or civil partner\n        sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 2: marital status has newUnionAfterWidowhood = true\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n            sh:message \"User's marital status must indicate new union after widowhood.\"@en ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 3: has statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    # Also, the benefit is linked via isEligibleFor?\n    # Wait, the benefit is the target, but the shape is for eligibility. Maybe include a checksFundingRequirement or similar?\n    # The example used ff:checksFundingRequirement, but maybe that's specific to their structure. Alternatively, just define the shape and target the user.\n.\n\nWait, in the example given, they had:\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ; ...\n\nSo perhaps we should include a similar property, like ff:checksFundingRequirement pointing to the benefit's individual. \n\nTherefore, the shape would have:\n\nff:Rentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102799525 ; # Link to the benefit\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ; \n\nAnd then the constraints as before. \n\nPutting it all together, the Turtle code would look like this:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the benefit\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance pension settlement\"@en .\n\n# Shape for eligibility\nff:Rentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102799525 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Condition 1: deceased spouse or civil partner\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Condition 2: new union after widowhood in marital status\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n            sh:message \"User's marital status must indicate new union after widowhood.\"@en ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n\n    # Condition 3: has statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance pension settlement\"@en .\n\n# SHACL shape for eligibility requirements\nff:Rentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102799525 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have deceased spouse/civil partner\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Missing deceased spouse or civil partner\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Must have new union after widowhood in marital status\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n            sh:message \"Marital status does not indicate new union after widowhood\"@en ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 3: Must have statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Missing statutory accident insurance\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL graph for validating eligibility for a specific social benefit based on the given ontology and examples. The benefit in question is the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' with IDLB B100019_LB_582422. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements provided in the text. The requirements are:\n\n1. The user has had a work accident, commute accident, or recognized occupational disease.\n2. They are participating in a qualified measure to participate in working life (occupational rehabilitation).\n\nNow, I have to map these requirements to the ontology terms provided.\n\nStarting with the first requirement: \"Arbeits oder Wegeunfall oder anerkannte Berufskrankheit\". Looking at the ontology, I see that WorkAccident (Arbeitsunfall), CommutingAccident (Wegeunfall), and OccupationalDisease (Berufskrankheit) are all subclasses of Event. Each of these should be linked via the hasEvent property. So the user must have at least one of these event types. \n\nNext, the second requirement: participation in a qualified measure (berufliche Reha). The ontology mentions ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, which is a class. The user must be participating in such a rehabilitation program. Looking at object properties, there's participates (ff:participates) which links a person to a Training instance. But OccupationalRehabilitation is a separate class, not a Training subclass. Wait, maybe the Training class has a subclass related to rehabilitation? Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to have an OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via some property. Wait, looking at the ontology again:\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class with a label \"Berufliche Rehabilitation\". The user needs to participate in a measure of this type. The object property 'participates' has a range of ff:Training, but OccupationalRehabilitation isn't a subclass of Training. Hmm. Maybe I need to check if there's another property. Alternatively, perhaps the OccupationalRehabilitation is linked via another property. Wait, the ontology also has ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, but that's for linking to the provider, not the participation itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's participation is via the ff:participates property, but the OccupationalRehabilitation is considered a type of Training? Let me check the ontology again:\n\nLooking at the Training subclasses, there's ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and ff:School, but not explicitly OccupationalRehabilitation. Wait, maybe the rehabilitation is part of another structure. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation linked via another property. Wait, the ontology has the object property ff:triggeringEvent which links EarningCapacity or OccupationalRehabilitation to an Event. But that might not be relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's participation in occupational rehabilitation is captured through another property. Let me think again. The requirement says \"teilnehmen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben (berufliche Reha)\". The key here is participation, so the ff:participates property might still be applicable if the OccupationalRehabilitation is considered a type of Training. Wait, looking at the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, but is it a subclass of Training? No, according to the ontology, Training has subclasses like VocationalTraining, School, etc. But OccupationalRehabilitation isn't listed as a subclass of Training. So maybe there's a mistake here, or perhaps the participation is through another property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'participates' property's range is ff:Training, but the user's rehabilitation is part of a Training instance. Alternatively, perhaps the requirement is better modeled by ensuring that the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation, and that this instance is linked via some other property. Wait, the ontology might have ff:participates as the correct property, but the object would be an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation. Let me check the ontology again:\n\nThe object property ff:participates has a range of ff:Training. So the user must be participating in a Training instance. However, OccupationalRehabilitation is a separate class, so unless there's a subclass of Training that represents this, it's a problem. Hmm. Maybe the user's participation in the rehabilitation is considered as a Training, so perhaps there's a subclass of Training for this. Looking back at the ontology, under Training subclasses, there's ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and ff:School, but not OccupationalRehabilitation. Maybe the user's participation in the rehabilitation is represented by another property?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'occupational rehabilitation' is captured through another property. Wait, the ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause which links a person to a Disability causing the need for integration help. But that's not exactly participation.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look at the example provided. In the example for Insolvenzgeld, they used ff:hasEmployment and related properties. Let's think differently. The requirement says they are participating in a qualified measure (berufliche Reha). The term 'berufliche Reha' translates to occupational rehabilitation. The ontology has the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. So perhaps the user must have an instance of this class linked via a property. Let me check if there's a property that connects a person to an OccupationalRehabilitation instance. \n\nLooking at the ontology's object properties, there's ff:resultsInTreatment which links an Event to an OccupationalRehabilitation. So maybe the rehabilitation is a result of an event, but that's not directly the participation. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:participates link to an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation even if it's not a Training. But the range of participates is Training, so that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the participation is modeled via another property. Wait, the ontology has ff:participates with domain Person and range Training. So the user must be participating in a Training instance. If the occupational rehabilitation is considered a type of Training, then the Training instance would be an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. Wait, but in the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a separate class not under Training. This is a problem. Maybe the ontology is missing a subclass? Or perhaps I should proceed with the information available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'berufliche Reha' is captured through the ff:OccupationalRehabilitation class, and the participation is linked via another property. Alternatively, maybe the requirement is better modeled by checking that the user has a ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property. For example, perhaps there's a property like ff:requiresRehabilitation or something else. Wait, looking at the ontology's object properties:\n\nThere's ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which links a person to their rehabilitation provider. But that's about who provides it, not participation. \n\nHmm. This is a bit of a snag. Let me check the examples again. In the example provided for Insolvenzgeld, they used ff:participates when the requirement was about participation in a program. So in that case, the user participates in a Training. So perhaps the solution here is that the occupational rehabilitation is considered a form of Training, even if the ontology doesn't explicitly list it as such. Since the user's participation in a qualified measure (Reha) is needed, and the ontology's participates property expects a Training, maybe the Rehabilitation is a Training instance. Alternatively, maybe the user's participation in the rehabilitation is captured through another property, but I might have to use the available properties. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via another property. Let me think again. The requirement is \"taking part in a qualified measure for participation in working life (occupational rehabilitation)\". So the user's participation is the key. Since participates has a range of Training, perhaps the rehabilitation is considered a Training. Therefore, the user must have a Training instance that is an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation. So the SHACL constraint would check that the user's participates has at least one object that is a subclass of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. Wait, but in the ontology, OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, not a subclass of Training. So this might not be possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is simply that the user is participating in any training, but that's not specific. Maybe the example's approach can be adapted. Since the ontology might have an error here, or maybe I'm missing something, perhaps I'll proceed by using the participates property and ensuring that the Training instance has a certain property, like being of type OccupationalRehabilitation, even if that's not a subclass. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ontology's ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is intended to be part of the Training hierarchy, but it's a mistake in the ontology. For the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that the user's participation in the rehabilitation is via the participates property, and that the Training instance has a certain characteristic. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a ff:participates link to a Training instance that is linked via some other property to the OccupationalRehabilitation. This is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the requirement is simply that the user has a ff:participates link to a Training, and that the rehabilitation is considered part of the Training's type. Since the user must be participating in a \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\", which is occupational rehab, perhaps the Training's type is captured via another property. Alternatively, perhaps the training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency), but that might not be the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property, even if the ontology doesn't specify. But according to the ontology, the only properties for ff:Person related to rehabilitation are ff:hasRehabilitationProvider and ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause (which points to a Disability). \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look for another approach. Let me see the data properties. There's ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause which links a person to a Disability causing the need for integration help. But that's about the reason, not participation. \n\nWait, the ontology does have an object property ff:resultsInTreatment which links an Event to an OccupationalRehabilitation. So maybe the user has an Event (like the accident or disease) that results in the rehabilitation. So the user must have an Event which results in an OccupationalRehabilitation. But the requirement is that the user is participating in the rehabilitation, not that the event caused it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation linked via another property. Let me check all object properties again. The ff:hasEvent property has a domain of Employer and Person. So the user can have an event. But how to link the rehabilitation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a ff:participates link to an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, even though the ontology's participates property's range is Training. Since the user can't have a Training instance that is also an OccupationalRehabilitation unless it's a subclass, this might not be possible. \n\nThis is a problem. Maybe I need to proceed with the available properties. Since the requirement is to participate in occupational rehabilitation, and the ontology's participates is linked to Training, perhaps the user must be participating in a Training that is part of the rehabilitation process. Maybe the Training's purpose is rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a ff:participates in a Training instance that has a certain property. For example, if the Training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency), but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'participating in a qualified measure' is captured by the presence of an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property. Let me think of another way. The ontology has the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, so maybe the user has an instance of that, and the participation is indicated by another property. For example, maybe there's a property like 'isParticipatingIn' but it's not listed. \n\nWait, perhaps the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider indicates that the user has a rehabilitation provider, implying they are undergoing it. That might be the way. Let me check the ontology description for ff:hasRehabilitationProvider: it says \"Links a person to their rehabilitation provider.\" So if the user has a rehabilitation provider (like the Federal Employment Agency), that indicates they are in a rehabilitation process. \n\nTherefore, the second requirement could be modeled by requiring that the user has a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider. But the requirement is more specific: they must be participating in a measure for participation in working life. The provider's existence might be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the requirement says they must be participating in the measure, so maybe the presence of a rehabilitation provider is enough to indicate that. Alternatively, perhaps they need to have an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a property. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property like ff:hasEvent or another. Since I'm stuck here, perhaps I'll proceed by using the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider property to indicate participation, as that's the closest available property. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the requirement is simply that the user has a ff:participates link to a Training instance, and that the Training is related to rehabilitation. But without knowing the exact ontology structure, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an ff:participates in a Training, and that Training is related to rehabilitation via another property. But without specific properties in the ontology for that, this is hard. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the ff:participates property, assuming that the rehabilitation is considered a form of Training. The exact modeling might require that the Training instance has certain characteristics, but since the ontology doesn't specify, perhaps the minimal requirement is just that the user is participating in any Training, but that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an ff:participates link to a Training, and that Training is linked to an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance via ff:resultsInTreatment. But that's getting too complex. \n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be met if the user has a ff:participates link to any Training, but that's not specific enough. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the requirement is better captured by the existence of an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property, even if it's not explicitly in the ontology. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a property like ff:hasEvent (since it's a class under Event?), but looking at the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class but not a subclass of Event. \n\nHmm, this is a bit of a dead end. Let me look back at the example given. In the example for Insolvenzgeld, they used ff:hasEmployment and related properties. Maybe here, the key is to ensure that the user has an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via some property, even if it's not directly in the ontology's object properties. Alternatively, perhaps the participation is indicated by the presence of a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider. \n\nGiven the time constraints and the need to proceed, I'll make an assumption here. Let's say that participating in the rehabilitation requires the user to have a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider. The example uses ff:hasEmploymentStatus to check employment status, so perhaps here, the participation is checked via the provider. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property like ff:triggeringEvent. Wait, the triggeringEvent is for EarningCapacity or OccupationalRehabilitation, so maybe the user has an OccupationalRehabilitation instance, and that's linked via a property. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:participates in a Training that is linked to an OccupationalRehabilitation via another property. But without more info, this is hard. \n\nLet me try to proceed step by step with the first requirement first.\n\nFirst requirement: user has an event of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nThe ontology has these as subclasses of Event. So the user must have an Event of one of these types linked via ff:hasEvent. \n\nThe property path would be ff:hasEvent, and the class constraints would require that the event is one of those three classes. \n\nSo for the first condition, the SHACL shape would check that the user has an event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. \n\nNow, the second requirement: participating in a qualified measure (berufliche Reha). \n\nThe ontology has the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, which seems to represent this. To participate in it, perhaps the user has an instance of this class linked via a property. \n\nLooking at the ontology's object properties, there's ff:participates which links to a Training. Since OccupationalRehabilitation isn't a subclass of Training, this might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the participation is via another property. \n\nAlternatively, the user has a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which implies they are undergoing rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an ff:participates in a Training that is related to rehabilitation. Since the ontology doesn't specify, perhaps the minimal requirement is just that they have a participates link. But the requirement specifies \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\", which is the purpose of the rehabilitation. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider property to indicate that they are in a rehabilitation process. \n\nAlternatively, the requirement could be that the user has an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation linked via a property like ff:triggeringEvent. \n\nWait, the ff:triggeringEvent property links EarningCapacity or OccupationalRehabilitation to an Event. So perhaps the user has an OccupationalRehabilitation instance, which is linked to an event (the accident or disease), and that implies participation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked via a property like ff:hasEvent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an instance of OccupationalRehabilitation, and that's enough. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, since that indicates that a provider is involved in their rehabilitation, implying participation. \n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be:\n\n1. User has an event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\n2. User has a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider.\n\nNow, let's structure this in SHACL.\n\nFirst, the shape for the benefit:\n\nThe benefit's URI is ff:B100019_LB_582422.\n\nThe first requirement is the event. So a property shape that requires at least one event of those types.\n\nSecond requirement: hasRehabilitationProvider.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nAlso, the target node is ff:User.\n\nNow, in SHACL, the first requirement can be modeled as a property shape on ff:hasEvent, with a sh:class constraint that the event must be one of the three classes. Additionally, since the requirement is that any of the three events exists, we can use a sh:or condition with three node shapes each requiring one of the event types.\n\nAlternatively, a single property shape with sh:class in (ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, ff:OccupationalDisease).\n\nWait, but sh:class can take a list of classes. Let's see:\n\nFor the first condition, the user must have at least one event of those types. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class [\n        a sh:OrConstraint ;\n        sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, but SHACL's sh:class takes a class or a list of classes. Alternatively, using sh:or with node shapes each checking the class.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n        [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n        [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n    );\n    sh:message \"You must have had a work/commuting accident or occupational disease.\"@en;\n].\n\nThat would work.\n\nFor the second requirement: the user must have a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider.\n\nSo another property shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nPutting this into the overall shape.\n\nNow, let's also make sure the benefit is properly defined.\n\nThe benefit's URI is ff:B100019_LB_582422, and the labels are from the text: \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\" (DE) and the English translation would be something like \"Statutory Accident Insurance Transitional Allowance for Occupational Rehabilitation\".\n\nNow, the final SHACL graph would look like this:\n\nPrefixes as in the example.\n\nThe benefit declaration:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Transitional Allowance for Occupational Rehabilitation\"@en .\n\nThe shape for the benefit's eligibility:\n\nff:GUVRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Event must be Work/Commuting Accident or Occupational Disease\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"An accident or occupational disease is required.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: Participates in occupational rehab (has rehab provider)\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be participating in occupational rehabilitation.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nThat seems to cover both requirements. \n\nWait, but the second requirement says \"taking part in a qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben (berufliche Reha)\". The hasRehabilitationProvider indicates they have a provider, which implies participation, so that's probably acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a ff:participates in a Training linked to OccupationalRehabilitation. But without the ontology's explicit structure, using the provider is the best available option.\n\nThus, the final SHACL graph should include these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Benefit metadata\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de ;\n    rdfs:label \"Statutory Accident Insurance Transitional Allowance for Occupational Rehabilitation\"@en .\n\n# Main validation shape for User node\nff:GUVRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have suffered work/commuting accident or occupational disease\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] \n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"You must have had a work/commuting accident or recognized occupational disease.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Must be participating in occupational rehabilitation\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be participating in an approved occupational rehabilitation program.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Kinderzuschlag (DE) / Child supplement (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_581863\nRequirements text (EN): To receive a child supplement, the following requirements must be met:\n\n  * Your child/children is/are younger than 25, not married or partnered and lives in your household.\n  * You receive child benefit or a comparable benefit for your child/children, for example from abroad.\n  * You have \n    * as a couple, a joint gross income of at least EUR 900.00 per month (excluding housing benefit, child benefit and child supplement) or\n    * as a single parent at least EUR 600.00 per month.\n  * Your income, which is offset against the child supplement, is not so high that the child supplement is reduced to zero.\n  * You do not have any significant assets.\n  * As a rule, you can receive the child supplement if your income, child benefit, any housing benefit to which you may be entitled and the child supplement can cover the needs of the whole family within the meaning of SGB II.\n  * Child supplement is subordinate to other possible income of the child; there may be an obligation to apply for priority claims such as maintenance or advance maintenance payments.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User receives child benefit for at least one child (GREEN) that also  \n  - is younger than 25 years (GREEN) AND\n  - is not married or in a registered partnership (GREEN) AND\n  - lives in the same household as the user. (GREEN)\n  - is not eligible for other benefits with priority over child supplement. (YELLOW: which benefits have priority over child supplement and whether the child is eligible must be inferred or explained)\n7. With their partner, the user's shared gross income is at least 900€/Month. (GREEN)\n8. As a single parent, the user's gross income is at least 600€/Month. (GREEN)\n9. User income that will be offset against child supplement does not reduce child supplement to zero. (YELLOW: how user income is offset against child supplement must be inferred or explained)\n10. User has no considerable assets. (YELLOW: meaning of considerable assets must be inferred or explained, definition see [1])\n11. Typically, user is eligible if their income, child allowance, housing benefit, and child supplement can cover the household needs according to SGB II. (RED: ambiguous qualifier \"typically\")\n\n[1] SGB 2 § 12: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_2/__12.html\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in RDF user graphs.\n    - Examples: Examples with step-by-step solutions to learn how to approach the task.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements for the social benefit 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' (Transition Allowance for People with Disabilities) with IDLB B100019_LB_102716305. The user provided a German text outlining the eligibility conditions, and my job is to translate these into a SHACL graph that validates the user data against these criteria.\n\nStarting with the main conditions listed:\n\n1. **Disability and Need for Support**: The user must have a disability and require special support for workforce integration. The Federal Employment Agency must be their rehabilitation provider.\n2. **Participation in a Specific Measure**: They must be participating in one of the listed measures like vocational training, vocational preparation, supported employment, etc.\n3. **Pre-Employment Period (Last 3 Years)**: During the past three years, they must meet one of these sub-conditions:\n   - At least 12 months of social insurance coverage.\n   - Eligibility for unemployment benefit under SGB III and currently applied.\n   - Entitlement to unemployment benefits under the Soldiers' Compensation Act (SVG).\n4. **Exceptions**:\n   - If a vocational returnee with disabilities, the 3-year pre-employment period doesn't apply.\n   - The pre-employment conditions may be waived if within the last year before starting the measure, they obtained a recognized vocational qualification or equivalent exam.\n\nNow, I need to map these to the ontology provided. Let's break down each condition and see which ontology terms apply.\n\n**1. Disability and Need for Support**\n- The user must have a disability: Use `ff:hasDisability` DataProperty set to true.\n- They need special support for integration: This might be covered by `ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause` pointing to a Disability.\n- The rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency (`ff:FederalEmploymentAgency`). So `ff:hasRehabilitationProvider` should link to that individual.\n\n**2. Participation in a Measure**\n- The user must be participating in one of the listed measures. The ontology has `ff:participates` pointing to `ff:Training` or its subclasses. The specific measures mentioned (like vocational training, etc.) are under `ff:Training` subclasses such as `ff:VocationalTraining`, `ff:School` (for schools?), `ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea`, etc. So the requirement is that `ff:participates` must have a value of one of these training types. However, in SHACL, we can use a `sh:class` constraint to ensure the object is a subclass of `ff:Training`?\n\nWait, but the exact classes for each measure need to be checked. For example, \"Berufsausbildung\" is `ff:VocationalTraining`, \"Eingangsverfahren und Berufsbildungsbereich\" is `ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea`, \"berufliche Weiterbildung\" might be another subclass under `ff:Training`. Since the exact subclasses aren't all listed, maybe better to just check that the `participates` points to a `ff:Training` instance. So the shape would require that the user has a `participates` property with a value that is a `ff:Training` instance.\n\n**3. Pre-Employment Period Conditions (Last 3 Years)**\nThe user must meet at least one of three sub-conditions here. This is an OR condition. In SHACL, this can be modeled using a `sh:or` constraint with three different shapes.\n\n- **12 Months Social Insurance (ff:socialSecurityDuration?)**: The ontology has `ff:socialSecurityDuration` which links to a Duration. The Duration's `ff:monthsWithinLast3Years` should be >=12. So need to check that the user has a socialSecurityDuration where monthsWithinLast3Years is >=12.\n- **Eligibility for Unemployment Benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842)**: The user should be eligible (`ff:isEligibleFor`) for Unemployment Benefit (IDLB 576842) and have applied. But the ontology doesn't have a property indicating application, so maybe just check eligibility. But the text says \"anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld und aktuell beantragt\" – so maybe two conditions: isEligibleFor and has applied? Since applying might not be in the ontology, perhaps only check eligibility.\n- **Entitlement to SVG Unemployment Benefit (ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG)**: The user must be eligible (`isEligibleFor`) for this benefit.\n\nWait, the problem states \"Sie haben Anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld nach dem SGB III und dieses aktuell beantragt.\" So they must both be entitled and have applied. Since the ontology includes `ff:receivedBenefit` but maybe not application status, perhaps the application is considered part of eligibility. Alternatively, the ontology's `ff:isEligibleFor` could cover the entitlement, and the application is part of the process but not modeled here. Since the ontology doesn't have an \"applied\" flag, maybe we can only check eligibility.\n\nSo for the three sub-conditions, the SHACL would need to check that at least one of these three is true.\n\n**4. Exceptions**\nThe exceptions are a bit tricky. The first exception is for vocational returnees (ff:isVocationalReturnee) where the 3-year pre-employment period is waived. So if the user has `ff:isVocationalReturnee` true, they don't need to meet the pre-employment period conditions. This is an exemption based on that property.\n\nThe second exception allows waiving the pre-employment period if within the last year they obtained a recognized qualification. This would involve checking the existence of an event (like completing an exam) within the last year, but the ontology's `ff:hasEvent` might be involved. However, the exact terms for this aren't clear. The ontology has `ff:MoveToGermany` and others but maybe not specific education completion events. Perhaps `ff:Training` with certain properties, like a duration or commissioning by the agency. Alternatively, the `ff:hasEvent` linked to a training completion? Not sure. Since this might be ambiguous or require third-party assessment (like whether the qualification is recognized), this might be marked as RED and excluded. The user instructions say not to model ambiguous or third-party decisions.\n\nNow, considering the rules:\n\n- Only include GREEN/YELLOW requirements (those that can be assessed without ambiguity).\n- Use only SHACL Core components (no SPARQL shapes).\n\nLet's go through each condition again with this in mind.\n\n**Disability and Support:**\n- `hasDisability` must be true.\n- Need for support via `workforceIntegrationProblemBecause` pointing to a Disability (so must have that property with a Disability instance).\n- Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency. So `hasRehabilitationProvider` must have value `ff:FederalEmploymentAgency`.\n\nThese are all checkable via data properties and object properties, so these are GREEN.\n\n**Participation in Measure:**\n- Must `participates` in a `ff:Training` instance. The specific training types might not be necessary to check, as the main requirement is participation in any of the listed ones, which are all subclasses of Training. So the shape can require that `participates` has a value of type `ff:Training`.\n\n**Pre-Employment Conditions (3-year period):**\n- The user must have at least one of:\n  a) Social Security Duration with monthsWithinLast3Years >=12,\n  b) Eligible for Unemployment Benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842),\n  c) Eligible for SVG Unemployment Benefit (ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG).\n\nEach of these can be checked via SHACL constraints. However, how to model the OR condition.\n\nIn SHACL, an OR can be done with `sh:or` on a shape, where each branch is a constraint that must be satisfied. So the shape for the pre-employment period would require that at least one of the three conditions is met.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For the 12 months: Check if there exists a `ff:socialSecurityDuration` where the duration's `ff:monthsWithinLast3Years` is >=12.\n\nWait, the user has a `ff:socialSecurityDuration` which is a `ff:Duration` instance. So:\n\n- The `ff:socialSecurityDuration` must have `ff:monthsWithinLast3Years` >= 12.\n\nThus, the path would be `ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years` and the constraint would be `sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:integer`.\n\nSimilarly for the other conditions.\n\nThe OR would require that either this condition is met, or the user is eligible for either of the two benefits.\n\nHowever, the user must have at least one of the three. So the SHACL for the pre-employment period would be a group shape with `sh:or` containing three different paths.\n\n**Exceptions:**\n- If the user is a vocational returnee (`isVocationalReturnee` true), they are exempt from the pre-employment conditions. So the pre-employment conditions only apply if `isVocationalReturnee` is false.\n\nThis can be modeled with a `sh:closed` constraint or an `sh:or` that includes the exception. Alternatively, use a `sh:not` in the pre-employment constraint when the exception is present.\n\nAlternatively, structure the overall shape so that either the exception is true OR the pre-employment conditions are met.\n\nThis requires a logical structure where the overall constraint is:\n\n(pre-employment condition met OR isVocationalReturnee) AND (exception 2 or not applicable)\n\nBut exception 2 is about the last year's qualification. Since that might be ambiguous or not fully modelable, perhaps it's excluded.\n\nThe second exception (qualification within last year) may require checking the existence of an event (like a training completion) within the last year. The ontology has `ff:hasEvent`, but the exact type of event isn't specified. Since the requirement is that the event happened within the last year, we'd need a date. The ontology has `ff:hasDate` on events. So the event's `ff:hasDate` must be within the last year (from validation time?). But SHACL doesn't handle temporal validation directly unless using SPARQL, which is not allowed here. So this might be a RED condition and excluded.\n\nTherefore, we'll focus on the first exception.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape needs to:\n\n- Target ff:User.\n- Require hasDisability = true.\n- Require workforceIntegrationProblemBecause exists (pointing to a Disability).\n- Require hasRehabilitationProvider = ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n- Require participates in a Training.\n- AND (either:\n   - isVocationalReturnee is true (then no need for pre-employment period)\n   - OR (pre-employment conditions are met)\n)\n- The pre-employment conditions require at least one of the three options (social security, unemployment benefit eligibility, SVG benefit).\n\nAdditionally, the exceptions are part of the conditions, so the overall structure must handle the OR between the exceptions and the main conditions.\n\nWait, actually the exceptions override the pre-employment period requirements. So if the user is a vocational returnee, they don't need to meet the pre-employment period's conditions. Therefore, the pre-employment constraints only apply if the exception isn't met.\n\nThus, the overall structure is:\n\nThe user must satisfy all the main conditions (disability, participation, rehabilitation provider) AND either:\n\n- (They are a vocational returnee), OR\n\n- (They are not a vocational returnee AND meet the pre-employment period conditions)\n\nThis can be modeled with a SHACL shape that uses sh:and for the main conditions, and then a group with sh:or between the exception and the pre-employment conditions.\n\nBut in SHACL, this might be structured as:\n\nA shape for the entire requirement would have:\n\n- All the main conditions (disability, participation, rehab provider).\n\nThen, a constraint that:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path [] ; \n   sh:or ( [constraint1] [constraint2] ) \n]\n\nWhere constraint1 is the exception (isVocationalReturnee true), and constraint2 is the pre-employment conditions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to structure it as:\n\nThe pre-employment conditions are only required if isVocationalReturnee is false.\n\nSo the pre-employment constraints are under a conditional where isVocationalReturnee is false.\n\nBut SHACL Core doesn't have conditionals. So we can use sh:or with:\n\nEither:\n\n- The user has isVocationalReturnee true (so no need to meet the pre-employment conditions), or\n\n- The user has isVocationalReturnee false AND meets the pre-employment conditions.\n\nBut how to express \"if isVocationalReturnee is true, then the pre-employment conditions are not required\".\n\nAlternatively, the pre-employment conditions are required UNLESS isVocationalReturnee is true. So the constraint is:\n\nThe user must meet the pre-employment conditions OR the isVocationalReturnee is true.\n\nThus, in SHACL, it's an OR between the exception and the pre-employment conditions.\n\nTherefore, the pre-employment part is a shape that says:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n   [sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee; sh:hasValue true], \n\n   [sh:group [\n      sh:property [\n         ... the three pre-employment conditions OR'ed together ...\n      ]\n   ] \n)\n\nPutting all this together, here's a draft:\n\nFirst, the shape starts with the targetNode as ff:User.\n\nThen, the properties:\n\n1. hasDisability must be true.\n2. must have workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a Disability (object property).\n3. must have hasRehabilitationProvider = ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n4. must have participates pointing to a Training (so the object must be a Training instance).\n5. The pre-employment or exception condition.\n\nNow, structuring the pre-employment/or condition:\n\nThe pre-employment conditions are an OR of three possibilities. Each of those three is a condition that must be met (with at least one).\n\nSo for the pre-employment group:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n   [sh:property [ \n       sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ; \n       sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int \n   ]], \n\n   [sh:property [ \n       sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; \n       sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 \n   ]], \n\n   [sh:property [ \n       sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; \n       sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG \n   ]]\n)\n\nThen, the overall OR between the exception (isVocationalReturnee) and this group.\n\nPutting this together, the pre-employment part in the shape would be:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n   [sh:property [ \n       sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; \n       sh:hasValue true \n   ]], \n\n   [sh:group [\n       sh:property [\n           sh:or ( \n               [sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years ; sh:minInclusive \"12\"],\n               [sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842],\n               [sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG]\n           )\n       ]\n   ]]\n)\n\nWait, but the group needs to have the three conditions OR'ed, so the sh:or is inside the sh:property's constraints. So each option is a shape in the sh:or list.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe full shape would have the following properties:\n\n- hasDisability: must be true\n- workforceIntegrationProblemBecause must exist (i.e., has at least one)\n- hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency\n- participates must have a Training instance\n- pre-employment condition (as above)\n\nAdditionally, check that the user has at least one of the workforceIntegrationProblemBecause.\n\nWait, for the workforceIntegrationProblemBecause, the user must have it because of a disability. So:\n\nThe user must have a `ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause` that is a Disability. So the property must exist, and the value must be an instance of ff:Disability.\n\nIn SHACL, that would be:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n   sh:minCount 1 ;\n   sh:class ff:Disability\n]\n\nAlso, the rehabilitation provider must be exactly the FederalEmploymentAgency, so:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n   sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n]\n\nThe participation must point to a Training instance:\n\nsh:property [\n   sh:path ff:participates ;\n   sh:minCount 1 ;\n   sh:class ff:Training\n]\n\nPutting all this into Turtle:\n\nThe SHACL shape for the benefit would be something like:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102716305 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de, \"Transition Allowance for People with Disabilities\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:TransitionAllowanceShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # 1. hasDisability must be true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # 2. workforceIntegrationProblemBecause must point to a Disability\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a disability-related workforce integration problem.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # 3. has Rehabilitation Provider as FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # 4. participates in a Training\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;\n        sh:message \"Must be participating in a recognized training program.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # 5.

So the structure is correct here.\n\nAlso, need to check if the paths are correct. For example:\n\n- `ff:socialSecurityDuration` is an object property from Person to Duration. So the path for `ff:socialSecurityDuration/ff:monthsWithinLast3Years` is correct, as `monthsWithinLast3Years` is a data property of Duration.\n\nAnother consideration: The user must have exactly one socialSecurityDuration, or can they have multiple? Assuming they have one, but SHACL's sh:minInclusive would require that at least one such Duration has monthsWithinLast3Years >=12.\n\nThis should work.\n\nAdditionally, the shape must be named and linked to the benefit.\n\nThe shape's name could be something like ff:TransitionAllowanceShape.\n\nAlso, ensure all prefixes are included.\n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\n- The `sh:or` for the pre-employment and exception is correctly structured as two options.\n- Each condition in the OR must be a valid SHACL shape.\n- The paths for all properties exist in the ontology.\n\nYes, all the properties (hasDisability, workforceIntegrationProblemBecause, hasRehabilitationProvider, participates, socialSecurityDuration, isEligibleFor) are present in the ontology.\n\nThe exception for vocational returnee is handled by checking the boolean property.\n\nThe second exception (qualification within last year) is excluded as it's not modelable without SPARQL or ambiguous.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102716305 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de, \"Transition Allowance for People with Disabilities\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:TransitionAllowanceShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # 1.

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Kinderzuschlag (DE) / Child supplement (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_581863\nRequirements text (EN): To receive a child supplement, the following requirements must be met:\n\n  * Your child/children is/are younger than 25, not married or partnered and lives in your household.\n  * You receive child benefit or a comparable benefit for your child/children, for example from abroad.\n  * You have \n    * as a couple, a joint gross income of at least EUR 900.00 per month (excluding housing benefit, child benefit and child supplement) or\n    * as a single parent at least EUR 600.00 per month.\n  * Your income, which is offset against the child supplement, is not so high that the child supplement is reduced to zero.\n  * You do not have any significant assets.\n  * As a rule, you can receive the child supplement if your income, child benefit, any housing benefit to which you may be entitled and the child supplement can cover the needs of the whole family within the meaning of SGB II.\n  * Child supplement is subordinate to other possible income of the child; there may be an obligation to apply for priority claims such as maintenance or advance maintenance payments.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User receives child benefit for at least one child (GREEN) that also  \n  - is younger than 25 years (GREEN) AND\n  - is not married or in a registered partnership (GREEN) AND\n  - lives in the same household as the user. (GREEN)\n  - is not eligible for other benefits with priority over child supplement. (YELLOW: which benefits have priority over child supplement and whether the child is eligible must be inferred or explained)\n7. With their partner, the user's shared gross income is at least 900€/Month. (GREEN)\n8. As a single parent, the user's gross income is at least 600€/Month. (GREEN)\n9. User income that will be offset against child supplement does not reduce child supplement to zero. (YELLOW: how user income is offset against child supplement must be inferred or explained)\n10. User has no considerable assets. (YELLOW: meaning of considerable assets must be inferred or explained, definition see [1])\n11. Typically, user is eligible if their income, child allowance, housing benefit, and child supplement can cover the household needs according to SGB II.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Kinderzuschlag' (Child Supplement) benefit based on the given requirements. First, I'll start by understanding the requirements in German and translating them into English to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe benefit's ID is B100019_LB_581863. The requirements listed are:\n\n1. The child(ren) must be under 25, not married/partnered, and living in the user's household.\n2. The user must receive child benefit (Kindergeld) or equivalent for the child.\n3. Income conditions:\n   - As a couple: joint gross income at least €900/month (excluding housing benefit, child benefit, and child supplement).\n   - As a single parent: personal gross income at least €600/month.\n4. The user's income offset against the child supplement shouldn't reduce it to zero.\n5. No significant assets.\n6. The user's income plus other benefits must cover the family's needs under SGB II.\n7. The child supplement is subordinate to other income sources for the child; must pursue priority claims like maintenance.\n\nNow, looking at the ontology provided, I need to map these requirements to the existing classes, properties, and individuals. Let's break each requirement down.\n\nStarting with requirement 1: The child must be under 25. The ontology has 'hasAge' as a data property of Person, so that's straightforward. The child must not be married or in a civil union. The marital status options include Married, CivilUnion, so we can check that the child's marital status is not in those. Living in the same household: The 'sameHouseholdAs' property links two people in the same household. So the child must have a 'sameHouseholdAs' link to the User.\n\nRequirement 2: The user must receive child benefit for the child. The 'receivesChildBenefitFor' property connects a person to their child for whom they receive benefit. So the User must have this property pointing to the child.\n\nRequirement 3: Income conditions. The user must have either a couple's income over €900 or single parent's income over €600. The ontology has 'familyGrossIncome' under Income for couples and 'personalGrossIncome' for individuals. The 'isSingleParent' data property indicates if the user is a single parent. So, we can model this with an 'or' condition between two shapes: one where isSingleParent is false (couple) and familyGrossIncome ≥900, and another where isSingleParent is true and personalGrossIncome ≥600.\n\nRequirement 4: Income offset against child supplement not reducing it to zero. The 'reducesChildSupplementTo' data property on Income tells the remaining amount after reduction. So we need this value to be greater than 0. So, the path would be (hasIncome/reducesChildSupplementTo) with minExclusive 0.\n\nRequirement 5: No considerable assets. The 'hasConsiderableAssets' property is a boolean, so we set this to false.\n\nRequirement 6: Income plus other benefits must cover family needs under SGB II. The problem states this is ambiguous (as per the example) because it's a subjective assessment by authorities. So we exclude this.\n\nRequirement 7: Child supplement is subordinate to other claims. The 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' property links a person to a benefit if they have no priority claims over it. So the child must have this property pointing to the Kinderzuschlag benefit. Wait, actually, the requirement says the user must ensure there are no other priority claims for the child. So perhaps the user must have their children not eligible for other benefits with higher priority. So for each child, they must have 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' the Kinderzuschlag. That should be part of the child's shape.\n\nNow, checking the ontology again: 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' is a property from Person to SocialBenefit, indicating the person isn't eligible for benefits that have priority over the specified one. Since the requirement is that the child's other income doesn't have priority over the child supplement, maybe the user must ensure the child doesn't have such claims. Wait, the exact wording is \"Kinderzuschlag is subordinate to other possible income of the child; must pursue priority claims like maintenance.\" So the user must check that there are no such priority claims existing, or they must pursue them. Since we can't model pursuing, perhaps the user's data must indicate that the child has no priority claims over the child supplement. Therefore, each child must have a 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' link to the Kinderzuschlag benefit.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape for the User (targetNode ff:User) will have constraints:\n\n- Must have at least one child (receivesChildBenefitFor) that meets the child's conditions (age, marital status, household, and no priority claims).\n- The income conditions (either/or shapes).\n- Income reduction check (reducesChildSupplementTo >0).\n- No considerable assets (hasConsiderableAssets = false).\n\nNow, constructing the Turtle:\n\nFirst, define the SocialBenefit individual for Kinderzuschlag with its labels.\n\nThen the main shape for the benefit (KinderzuschlagShape), which targets ff:User. The properties include:\n\n- receivesChildBenefitFor with a qualifiedValueShape (ChildShape) ensuring each child meets criteria.\n- An 'or' condition between IncomeShapeA (couple) and IncomeShapeB (single parent).\n- The property for reducesChildSupplementTo must be >0.\n- hasConsiderableAssets must be false.\n\nThe ChildShape includes:\n\n- hasAge <25.\n- maritalStatus not in (Married, CivilUnion).\n- sameHouseholdAs User.\n- hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the Kinderzuschlag benefit (B100019_LB_581863).\n\nIncomeShapeA: requires isSingleParent is false and familyGrossIncome ≥900.\n\nIncomeShapeB: requires isSingleParent is true and personalGrossIncome ≥600.\n\nI need to ensure all paths are correctly using the ontology's properties. For example, 'hasIncome' is an object property to Income, so to get familyGrossIncome, it's (ff:hasIncome / ff:familyGrossIncome). Similarly for personalGrossIncome.\n\nAlso, the 'sh:or' should list the two income shapes, so the User must satisfy either IncomeShapeA or IncomeShapeB.\n\nChecking if any parts were missed. The example solution had the same structure, so this approach should align. The 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' is correctly applied to the child nodes via the ChildShape.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_581863 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Kinderzuschlag\"@de, \"Child supplement\"@en .\n\nff:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:ChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet child criteria (age, marital status, household).\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        ff:IncomeShapeA\n        ff:IncomeShapeB\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo) ;\n        sh:minExclusive 0 ;\n        sh:message \"Child supplement would be reduced to zero.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"User has considerable assets.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nff:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 25 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ] .\n\nff:IncomeShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n    ] .\n\nff:IncomeShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n    ] .\n```"

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components. The final answer is:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Citizen benefit\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives citizen benefit.'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```\n\n--- END OF EXAMPLES ---\n\nTEXT:\nEs folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Bürgergeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_106311931.\n  * Sie sind erwerbsfähig.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit \"Bürgergeld\" (Citizen's Benefit) based on the given conditions. First, I need to carefully read and understand the requirements provided in the German text. Let me start by translating and structuring the requirements to ensure I grasp each condition properly.\n\nThe benefit in question is \"Bürgergeld\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_106311931. The eligibility criteria mentioned are:\n\n1. **Erwerbsfähig** (Earning Capacity):\n   - Can work at least 3 hours daily.\n   - At least 15 years old.\n   - Not reached the retirement age limit under the statutory pension insurance. The retirement age is 67 for those born after 1963; earlier born individuals need to check §7a SGB II.\n\n2. **Hilfebedürftig** (Needy):\n   - Cannot cover their own essential living expenses and those of dependent, non-earning household members through their own means (income, assets) or work, even with priority benefits like unemployment benefit, housing benefit, or child supplement.\n\n3. **Keine Vorrangansprüche** (No Prior Claims):\n   - No priority claims over other benefits (e.g., housing benefit) or other persons like former spouses or parents of their children.\n\n4. **Residence in Germany**:\n   - Must be living in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nNext, I need to map these requirements to the provided ontology. Let me go through each condition and see which ontology terms apply, ensuring I follow the rules given (only use SHACL Core, don't include ambiguous or third-party decisions, etc.).\n\n**1. Earning Capacity (Erwerbsfähig):**\n- The user must have an earning capacity. The ontology has the class `ff:EarningCapacity`. The condition specifies two parts:\n  - **Can work at least 3 hours per day**: The ontology has `ff:employableHoursPerDay` (xsd:decimal). The value should be at least 3.0.\n  - **Age between 15 and not exceeding retirement age**: \n    - `ff:hasAge` must be >= 15.\n    - Not reached retirement age: The retirement age is determined by birth year, but since it's variable (depends on birth year and legal code), maybe we can use `ff:isPensionable` which is a boolean. If `isPensionable` is false, then they haven't reached it yet. However, the ontology doesn't have a direct property for the retirement age limit. Since the exact calculation might be complex, perhaps the requirement is to ensure that `ff:isPensionable` is false. However, the user's age must be at least 15, so combining `hasAge >=15` and `isPensionable = false`.\n- So, constraints here would be:\n  - `ff:hasEarningCapacity` must have a value that is not `ff:UnfitForWork` (since they need to be able to work at least 3h/day).\n  - The `ff:employableHoursPerDay` must be >= 3.0.\n  - `ff:hasAge` must be >=15 and `ff:isPensionable` must be false.\n\nWait, but the ontology's `ff:EarningCapacity` is a class. The user's earning capacity is an instance of that, so perhaps the user must have an earning capacity that is not \"UnfitForWork\". Let me check the ontology again.\n\nLooking at the ontology:\n- `ff:UnfitForWork` is an individual of `ff:EarningCapacity` (Type ff:EarningCapacity). So, if the user has an earning capacity that is not UnfitForWork, then they are erwerbsfähig. So the user must have an earning capacity that is not UnfitForWork. \n\nTherefore, the user must have `ff:hasEarningCapacity` pointing to something that is not `ff:UnfitForWork`. Additionally, their `ff:employableHoursPerDay` must be >= 3.0. Also, age checks.\n\n**2. Needy (Hilfebedürftig):**\n- The user cannot cover their basic needs and those of their benefit unit using their own income/assets plus priority benefits. The ontology has `ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit` (a boolean). This should be false.\n\n**3. No Prior Claims (Keine Vorrangansprüche):**\n- The user must not have priority claims over other benefits or other persons. The ontology has `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` which links a person to a social benefit if they have no priority claims over it. Since this is for the Bürgergeld, the user must have no priority claims over other benefits. However, the exact modeling here might be tricky. The requirement says they shouldn't have priority claims over others, so perhaps the user must have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` for all relevant benefits? But since SHACL can't enforce universal conditions, maybe the requirement is that for the Bürgergeld, they must not have such claims. Alternatively, the user must not have any other benefits that have priority. Since the exact way isn't clear, but the ontology has the property `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver`, perhaps the user must have this property for the current benefit (Bürgergeld) or for all benefits. Hmm, maybe the condition is that the user must not have any prior claims over other benefits, so they must have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` for all such benefits. But how to model this in SHACL? Since it's tricky, maybe we can model that the user must not have any other benefits that they are eligible for which have priority, but this might require a negative condition which isn't straightforward in SHACL Core. Alternatively, maybe the requirement is that the user must have the `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` property pointing to the Bürgergeld itself, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not have any other benefits that they are receiving which have priority. Since this is unclear, maybe it's better to model the `hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` as a condition where the user must have this property for the current benefit. But perhaps the user must not have any other benefits that they are eligible for which take priority, so this might be a bit ambiguous. Since it's a requirement that might depend on other benefits, maybe this can be represented by ensuring that the user does not have any `ff:receivesBenefit` where that benefit has priority over Bürgergeld. But SHACL can't do that directly. Alternatively, maybe the ontology's `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` property is used in such a way that the user must have that property linked to the current benefit (Bürgergeld), indicating they have no prior claims over it. So the user must have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (the Bürgergeld itself?), but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not have any other benefits that they are eligible for which have priority. Since this is a bit ambiguous and possibly involves third-party decisions, maybe this requirement should be marked as RED and excluded. Wait, the problem states to exclude requirements that are at the discretion of third parties. The \"no priority claims\" might involve checking against other benefits which the user might have, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the requirement is that the user must not have any claims over other persons (like ex-spouses), which would require checking relationships. Since this is complicated and possibly involving third parties, perhaps this requirement should be excluded. Hmm, the example in the problem included some conditions they excluded as RED. So I need to be cautious here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the requirement is that the user has the `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` property pointing to the current benefit, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The exact wording is \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern oder anderen Personen\". The ontology has `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` which links a person to a social benefit if they have no priority claims over it. So perhaps the user must have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` for all social benefits that have priority. Since it's difficult to model \"all\", maybe the requirement is that the user has this property for the benefit they are applying for (Bürgergeld), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not have any other benefits where they have a priority claim, so maybe this needs to be checked via the `ff:receivesBenefit` or `ff:isEligibleFor` properties. Since this is unclear, perhaps this condition is ambiguous and should be marked as RED, hence excluded from the SHACL. Because determining if there are other priority claims might require checking against other benefits and their priority status, which may not be straightforward. Since the user can't assess this themselves without knowing all other benefits, it's possibly a third-party assessment and thus excluded. Wait, but the example included \"receives citizen benefit\" as green. Let me check the example again. In the example, they included a condition that the user must be receiving another benefit (citizen benefit) which was modeled with a SHACL constraint. So maybe here, the \"no prior claims\" can be represented via a property. Looking at the ontology, the user can have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` which is a property pointing to the social benefit. The requirement says they shouldn't have any priority claims over other benefits or persons, so perhaps the user must have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` for all relevant benefits, but in SHACL, maybe we can require that they have this property for the current benefit (Bürgergeld) or for all. Alternatively, maybe it's required that the user doesn't have any `ff:isEligibleFor` other benefits that have priority. Since SHACL can't enforce the absence of triples, perhaps this is tricky. Maybe this is better left out (marked as RED) because it's ambiguous how to model it without more details. Hmm, this is a bit uncertain. Let me note that and perhaps exclude it if needed.\n\n**4. Residence in Germany:**\n- The user must live in Germany. The ontology has `ff:countryOfResidence` which links a person to their country. So the user's `ff:countryOfResidence` must be `ff:Germany`.\n\nNow, let's go through each condition and determine if they can be modeled.\n\n**Condition 1: Earning Capacity (Erwerbsfähig):**\n- The user must have an earning capacity that is not UnfitForWork. Since `ff:hasEarningCapacity` is an object property pointing to an instance of `ff:EarningCapacity`, the user must have this property pointing to something that is not `ff:UnfitForWork`. In SHACL, this can be modeled with a `sh:hasValue` or `sh:class` constraint. Since `ff:UnfitForWork` is an individual, maybe using a `sh:nodeKind` or `sh:property` with `sh:hasValue` excluding that. Alternatively, using `sh:or` with `sh:not` to exclude it. For example:\n\nThe earning capacity must not be `ff:UnfitForWork`. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:not [\n        sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork\n    ];\n]\n\nAlternatively, require that the value is an instance of `ff:EarningCapacity` excluding `ff:UnfitForWork`, but that might be complex. Alternatively, check that the earning capacity is not `ff:UnfitForWork` and that their employable hours are sufficient.\n\nAdditionally, `ff:employableHoursPerDay` must be ≥ 3.0.\n\nAlso, age must be ≥15 and not have reached pension age.\n\nWait, the age part: `ff:hasAge` ≥15 and `ff:isPensionable` must be false (since they can't have reached retirement age). \n\nSo for age:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n    sh:message \"Age must be at least 15 years.\"\n]\n\nAnd for retirement age:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n    sh:hasValue false ;\n    sh:message \"Must not have reached pensionable age.\"\n]\n\nBut the problem says that the retirement age is 67 for those born after 1963, but calculating that would require knowing the birth year, which isn't directly available. Since the ontology doesn't have a birth date property, perhaps the `ff:isPensionable` is a boolean that the user must have set to false. Assuming that the system knows this via `ff:isPensionable`, then the constraint is valid.\n\n**Condition 2: Needy (Hilfebedürftig):**\n- `ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit` must be false. Because if they can't cover their needs, the value is false.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n    sh:hasValue false ;\n    sh:message \"Must not be able to cover basic needs of benefit unit.\"\n]\n\n**Condition 3: No Prior Claims (Keine Vorrangansprüche):**\nAs discussed earlier, this might be tricky. Let me think again. The ontology has `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver`, which links a person to a social benefit if they have no priority claims over it. The requirement is that the user must not have any priority claims over other benefits or persons. Since it's about not having any priority claims, perhaps the user must have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` for all relevant benefits. But how to model that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't enforce that, maybe we can require that they have `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` pointing to the current benefit (Bürgergeld), but that might not be correct. Alternatively, the user must not have any other benefits where they have a priority claim. This might be difficult. Since it's unclear, perhaps this condition is considered ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties (e.g., the agency decides if there are other claims), so we exclude it. Therefore, this condition is marked as RED and not included in the SHACL.\n\n**Condition 4: Residence in Germany:**\n- `ff:countryOfResidence` must be `ff:Germany`.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n    sh:message \"Must reside in Germany.\"\n]\n\nNow, compiling all the valid conditions:\n\nThe SHACL shape must target `ff:User`, so:\n\nff:BuergerGeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Earning capacity is not UnfitForWork\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork\n        ];\n        sh:message \"Earning capacity must not be UnfitForWork.\"\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Employable hours per day >=3\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive 3.0 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be able to work at least 3 hours per day.\"\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Age >=15\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be at least 15 years old.\"\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Not pensionable (not reached retirement age)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must not have reached pensionable age.\"\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Cannot cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must be unable to cover basic needs of benefit unit.\"\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Reside in Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"Must reside in Germany.\"\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the `ff:employableHoursPerDay` is a data property under `ff:Person`, so the path is correct. Also, `ff:hasAge` is a data property on Person.\n\nAlso, the `ff:hasEarningCapacity` must point to an instance that is not `ff:UnfitForWork`. The `sh:not` with `sh:hasValue` ensures that the value is not that exact individual. But maybe the user could have other earning capacities like `ff:FullEarningCapacity` or `ff:ReducedEarningCapacity`, which are allowed. So this should work.\n\nNow, putting this all together in Turtle syntax, making sure to use the correct prefixes and structure.\n\nAlso, the benefit's metadata should be included as per the example. So first, define the benefit's individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\nThen the shape for the constraints:\n\nThe shape's name can be something like ff:BuergerGeldShape or similar.\n\nWait, the example used the benefit's IDLB as the shape's name. Let me see the example:\n\nIn the example, the shape was named `ff:Einstiegsgeld` which is the German name of the benefit. Here, the benefit's IDLB is B100019_LB_106311931, so maybe the shape can be named after that, but perhaps using a more readable name. Alternatively, use the IDLB as part of the name. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example solution, they named the shape as `ff:Einstiegsgeld` (the German name), and the benefit was `ff:B100019_LB_102713860` (the IDLB). So maybe follow the same approach here, name the shape after the German label \"Bürgergeld\".\n\nThus:\n\nff:BuergerGeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    ... the properties ...\n\nAlso, the benefit's metadata:\n\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\nNow, putting all together in Turtle:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:BuergerGeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Earning capacity is not UnfitForWork\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork\n        ];\n        sh:message \"Earning capacity must not be UnfitForWork.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # Employable hours per day >=3\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive 3.0 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be able to work at least 3 hours per day.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # Age >=15\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be at least 15 years old.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # Not pensionable (not reached retirement age)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must not have reached pensionable age.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # Cannot cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must be unable to cover basic needs of benefit unit.\"@en ;\n    ], [\n        # Reside in Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"Must reside in Germany.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the `sh:targetNode` must be exactly `ff:User`, which it is here. All constraints are using SHACL Core components (sh:path, sh:minCount, sh:minInclusive, sh:hasValue, sh:not). \n\nNow, check if any conditions were excluded. The \"no priority claims\" was deemed ambiguous, so it's excluded. That's acceptable.\n\nAnother point: the retirement age condition uses `ff:isPensionable` which is a boolean. The problem states that the retirement age is 67 for post-1963 births, but since the ontology doesn't have a birth date, we have to rely on `ff:isPensionable` being set correctly, which is acceptable under the given ontology.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct SHACL graph.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_106311931 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bürgergeld\"@de, \"Citizen benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:BuergerGeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Earning capacity must not be UnfitForWork\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork\n        ];\n        sh:message \"Must have sufficient earning capacity (not UnfitForWork).\";\n    ], [\n        # Minimum 3 hours daily employability\n        sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n        sh:minInclusive 3.0 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be able to work at least 3 hours daily.\";\n    ], [\n        # Minimum age 15\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n        sh:message \"Must be at least 15 years old.\";\n    ], [\n        # Not pensionable (retirement age not reached)\n        sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must not have reached pensionable age.\";\n    ], [\n        # Inability to cover basic needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Must be unable to cover basic needs of benefit unit.\";\n    ], [\n        # Residence in Germany\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n        sh:message \"Must reside in Germany.\";\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit described. The benefit is \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\" with IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. Let me start by understanding the requirements given.\n\nFirst, the user must receive basic income support. The ontology has a social benefit called SocialAssistance (B100019_LB_106311931) which is the Citizen benefit (Bürgergeld), but wait, the example uses L100040_LB_8664880 for Grundsicherung. Wait, looking back at the ontology, there's an individual called SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance) which might be the basic income. Wait, in the examples, the example solution references L100040_LB_8664880, but in the ontology provided, the individual with the label \"Grundsicherung\" is actually L100040_LB_8665924 which is \"Housing benefit\" (Wohngeld)? Wait no, looking at the ontology's individual section:\n\nWait, in the ontology, there's an individual: L100040_LB_8665924 with labels \"Housing benefit\" and \"Wohngeld\". But the user requirement says \"Leistungen der Grundsicherung\", which is \"basic security\", perhaps referring to \"Grundsicherung\" which is a different benefit. Hmm, maybe there's a typo here. Wait the example solution they provided for the same benefit (B100019_LB_102730340) uses ff:L100040_LB_8664880, but that's not in the ontology given here. Wait, perhaps in the ontology provided, the Grundsicherung is actually SocialAssistance? Let me check the ontology again.\n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals:\n\n- SocialAssistance: Types: SocialBenefit. It has no labels, but maybe it's the Grundsicherung? Wait the example solution mentions \"Grundsicherung\" mapped to L100040_LB_8664880, but that's not present here. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Let me check the ontology again. The user-provided ontology has an individual called SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance) which is a SocialBenefit. So maybe that's the Grundsicherung? Alternatively, maybe the example's L100040_LB_8664880 is a different one not present here. Since in the current ontology, the closest is SocialAssistance, which might be the correct one here.\n\nThe first requirement is \"Sie erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" So the user must receive the basic security benefit. So in SHACL, the user must have a receivesBenefit link to the SocialAssistance (or whichever the correct term is). Since the ontology's SocialAssistance is a SocialBenefit, I'll use that.\n\nThe other requirements: \"Die Notwendigkeit der Unterstützungsleistung wurde im Gespräch mit Ihrer Integrationsfachkraft festgestellt.\" and \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" are both procedural steps involving third parties, so they are excluded as per the rules. So only the first requirement is included.\n\nNow, creating the SHACL shape. The target is ff:User. The shape should have a property that checks if the user has ff:receivesBenefit with ff:SocialAssistance. Wait, the ontology has a property ff:receivesBenefit which links a person to a social benefit they are currently receiving. So the path would be ff:receivesBenefit and must have at least one value of SocialAssistance.\n\nSo the SHACL constraint would be a node shape targeting ff:User, with a property that requires that the user has at least one receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance.\n\nNow, the SHACL syntax: \n\nThe shape is a sh:NodeShape, targetNode is ff:User.\n\nThe property part:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, but hasValue requires that all values must be exactly that, but maybe the user could have multiple benefits, but at least one must be SocialAssistance. Wait, but SHACL's sh:hasValue requires that the property's values must include that value. So using sh:hasValue with SocialAssistance would require that the user has at least one receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance. Alternatively, maybe use sh:qualifiedMinCount with a constraint component, but since we just need at least one occurrence, hasValue with minCount 1 should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL code would look like the example provided, but adjusted for the correct SocialBenefit.\n\nWait in the example's solution, they used:\n\nsh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8664880 which is not in the ontology here. But according to the given ontology, the SocialAssistance is the correct one. So I'll use ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nWait but the example's problem and solution were the same as the current user's input, but the example's solution used a different SocialBenefit. But since in the current ontology provided, that individual doesn't exist, I must use the correct one here.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe shape will have a property that requires the user to have at least one ff:receivesBenefit with ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nThe SHACL would be:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives basic income support'\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in the ontology, the SocialAssistance is indeed a SocialBenefit. So this should work. Also, need to ensure that the shape's target is ff:User and it's correctly structured.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement: User receives basic security benefit (Grundsicherung)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"User must currently receive basic security benefit (Grundsicherung)\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld (DE) / Statutory accident insurance injury allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_582429\nRequirements text (EN):  * You will receive injury benefit from the statutory accident insurance if you are unable to work due to an insurance event.\n  * Accidents at work, commuting accidents and occupational illnesses are deemed to be insurance events.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User has statutory accident insurance [1] (GREEN)\n2. User is unfit for work (YELLOW: \"unfit for work\" in a legal sense must be inferred or explained)\n3. The unfitness for work was caused by an insurance event (YELLOW: definition of the terms in a legal sense must be inferred or explained):\n\t- accident at work OR\n\t- a commuting accident OR\n\t- a recognized occupational disease.\n\n[1] Not explicitly mentioned in the requirements text, but implied by the benefit's name and \"insurance event\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

The benefit in question is \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\" with IDLB B100019_LB_582429. The requirements are:\n\n1. You receive the benefit if you are unable to work due to an \"Versicherungsfall\" (insurance event).\n2. The insurance events include work accidents, commuting accidents, and recognized occupational diseases.\n\nFrom the example provided, I recall that the solution included checking for statutory accident insurance, unfit for work status, and the triggering event being one of the specified types. \n\nNow, looking at the ontology, I need to map these requirements to the available classes and properties. The \"hasInsurance\" property links a person to an insurance, so using ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance makes sense here. The \"hasEarningCapacity\" should be set to \"UnfitForWork\", which is an individual of EarningCapacity. The triggering event must be one of the listed classes (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease). \n\nI also need to ensure that all components are part of the ontology. For instance, \"triggeringEvent\" is a property that can point to an Event, and those specific event types are subclasses of Event. The example used \"sh:class\" in the SHACL constraints, so I should follow that structure for the triggering events.\n\nNext, I should structure the SHACL shapes. The main shape targets ff:User, checks the insurance, earning capacity, and links to another shape for the triggering event. The nested shape (CapacityReductionShape) ensures that the triggering event is of the correct type.\n\nI must remember to include the benefit's metadata with its IDLB and labels. Also, all prefixes must be correctly declared, using the provided ontology prefixes.\n\nWait, the user mentioned not to invent terms outside the ontology. Let me double-check each element. The properties and classes used in the example are all present here. The \"triggeringEvent\" is indeed a valid property for EarningCapacity. The event types (WorkAccident, etc.) are all subclasses of Event. \n\nI should also make sure that the SHACL components are from the core, so no extensions. The example used sh:property, sh:class, sh:or, which are all core components. The messages should be included for clarity.\n\nFinally, serialize everything in Turtle syntax correctly, ensuring proper indentation and syntax like semicolons and periods. The shapes should be properly closed and linked. Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582429 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance injury allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:GUVVerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Requirement 1: User has statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Must have statutory accident insurance\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # Requirement 2: User is unfit for work due to qualifying event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:UnfitForWork ) ;\n        sh:node ff:UnfitnessCauseShape ;\n        sh:message \"Must be unfit for work due to qualifying event\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:UnfitnessCauseShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # The unfitness must be caused by an approved event type\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] \n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ] \n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ] \n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Unfitness must be caused by work/commuting accident or occupational disease\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld (DE) / Statutory accident insurance child injury benefit (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102799515\nRequirements text (EN): You are entitled to child injury benefit if:\n\n  * you have to supervise, look after or care for a child in your household due to the consequences of an insured event (school and kindergarten accident),\n  * your child has not yet reached the age of 12,\n  * you were entitled to a wage or other cash benefit (e.g. sickness benefit, unemployment benefit) before you supervised, looked after or cared for your child and\n  * no other person living in your household can look after your child.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User lives in the same household with at least one child (GREEN) that meets the following requirements:\n    - the child needs care [1] (YELLOW: Definition of need for care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred) AND\n    - the child is younger than 12 years (GREEN) AND\n\n2. The child's care needs were caused by a school accident OR a kindergarten accident (YELLOW: Definition of \"school accident\" and \"kindergarten accident\" in a legal sense must be inferred or explained)\n\n4. The user was entitled to a cash benefit like salary or unemployment benefit before the child's care needs started (YELLOW: which cash benefits qualify is not exhaustively clarified in the requirements text and must be inferred or explained)\n\n5. No other member of the household can provide the needed care (YELLOW: Under what conditions a household member \"can\" provide the care in a legal sense must be explained or inferred).\n\n[1] Distinction between supervision, care and nursing is unclear. Hence, simplified to \"care\".\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Bildung und Teilhabe' with the IDLB L100040_LB_12280162. Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nFirst, the eligibility criteria are for young people if they or their families receive one of the listed benefits. The listed benefits include Bürgergeld, Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen, or have families with low income. If they don't receive any of these, they can still be eligible if they can't cover education and participation costs themselves. The benefit is available up to age 25, and some participation costs are covered up to 18.\n\nWait, but the SHACL should target the ff:User node. So I need to model these conditions as constraints on ff:User.\n\nLet me break down the requirements step by step.\n\nThe first part says the applicant must be under 25. That's straightforward: hasAge < 25. But since the benefit applies up to the 25th birthday, the condition is hasAge ≤ 24? Wait, in terms of data properties, the hasAge is in completed years, so maxExclusive 25.\n\nNext, the user or their family must receive one of the listed benefits. The listed benefits are:\n\n1. Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931)\n2. Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (ff:L100040_LB_8665924 and ff:B100019_LB_581863)\nWait, Wohngeld is an individual, and Kinderzuschlag is another. The text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\". Since the user or family must receive these, perhaps the user must have a receivesBenefit link to both?\n\nWait, actually, the user or family receives one of the listed benefits. Each bullet is a separate option. So for the first bullet, the user or family must be receiving Bürgergeld. For the second bullet, receiving Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag together? Or either? The wording in German says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\", so perhaps it's a combination. But according to the ontology, Wohngeld is L100040_LB_8665924 and Kinderzuschlag is B100019_LB_581863. So maybe the user must be receiving both? That's a possible interpretation. Alternatively, maybe it's either of them. Hmm, the German text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" which could mean both are required? Or perhaps they are listed together as a category. Since it's under §6b BKGG, which I don't know, but in the ontology, they are separate. The problem is that the user must be receiving one of the listed benefits. Each bullet is a separate option. So the second bullet is receiving Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag together, so the user must have both? Or is it receiving either? This is ambiguous. Since I can't infer, maybe I should model it as the user must have receivesBenefit for Wohngeld OR Kinderzuschlag? But the original German says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\", which might mean both. Alternatively, perhaps the combination is a specific case under §6b BKGG. But without more info, perhaps it's better to model it as the user has receivesBenefit for at least one of these. Alternatively, maybe the user must have both. Since the user can't be sure, this might be ambiguous. But since the requirement says \"beziehen\" (receive), it's possible that each bullet is a separate requirement. So for the second bullet, the user must receive both Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag. Hmm, but that's a strict requirement. Alternatively, maybe it's either/or. Since the example in the problem's example included similar conditions, perhaps I should model each bullet as an option. For example, the user must receive at least one of the listed benefits. So:\n\nThe user must have receivesBenefit to Bürgergeld, or to Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag (combined?), or Sozialhilfe, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" is a combined benefit. But according to the ontology, they are separate. So perhaps the user needs to have both. But that's a problem because the user might only have one. Since the SHACL needs to be based on the ontology terms, perhaps the user must have receivesBenefit to at least one of the listed benefits (each bullet is a separate option). Let me parse each bullet:\n\nThe listed benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (SGB II) → ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n\n- Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG) → these are two separate benefits. So the user must have receivesBenefit for both Wohngeld (ff:L100040_LB_8665924) and Kinderzuschlag (ff:B100019_LB_581863)\n\n- Sozialhilfe (SGB XII – Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt, Grundsicherung) → ff:Sozialhilfe (ff:SocialAssistance?)\n\nWait in the ontology, the individual for Sozialhilfe is ff:SocialAssistance.\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen (§§ 2 oder 3 AsylbLG) → ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits (ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits is an individual of SocialBenefit)\n\n- Familien mit geringem Einkommen → families with low income. This isn't a specific benefit but a condition. The user's family has low income. How to model this? Since it's part of the listed requirements, maybe the user's family has low income. The ontology has a DataProperty ff:familyGrossIncome, but how does that relate? Maybe if their family's gross income is below a certain threshold. However, the exact threshold isn't specified, so perhaps this can't be modeled. Since it's at the discretion (we don't have the exact value), this might be ambiguous and thus excluded. But the problem says to exclude requirements that can't be assessed. Since \"familien mit geringem Einkommen\" is a condition without a defined threshold, perhaps we can't model it. So this condition must be excluded. \n\nWait, but the requirement says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" (families with low income) is one of the listed benefits. So the user must belong to such a family. Since the ontology has familyGrossIncome, but no data property indicating low income, maybe we can't model this. Hence, this condition can't be assessed and must be excluded. \n\nSo, the first part requires that the user or their family receives one of the first four benefits, or is part of a low-income family (which can't be modeled). So we can only include the first four. \n\nWait, but the requirement says \"either they or their families receive one of the listed benefits\". So the user must have receivesBenefit for one of the first four, OR their family (but how to model family?) \n\nWait, the user must be receiving one of the benefits OR their family is receiving one of them? Or is it that either the user or their family is receiving any of those benefits? \n\nThe German text says \"junge Menschen, wenn sie, beziehungsweise ihre Familien, eine der folgenden Leistungen beziehen\" → \"young people if they, or their families, receive one of the following benefits\". So the user or their family must be receiving at least one of those benefits. \n\nSo the condition is (user receivesBenefit X) OR (family receivesBenefit X). But how to model \"family\" in SHACL? The ontology doesn't have a direct property linking a person to their family's benefits. The only relevant properties are hasIncome, hasResidenceStatus, etc. There's no property like \"familyReceivesBenefit\". Since this is ambiguous, perhaps this part can't be modeled. Alternatively, maybe the user must themselves be receiving one of the benefits, but the text says \"or their families\". \n\nHmm, this complicates things. Since the ontology doesn't have a way to express the family's benefits, perhaps this requirement is ambiguous and can't be modeled. Therefore, maybe the entire condition about the family is excluded. Wait, but the user might have the benefit themselves. So perhaps the user must have receivesBenefit to at least one of the first four benefits. The family part can't be modeled. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's family's benefits are modeled through some other property, but I don't see it in the ontology. The ontology has parent's address, but not their benefits. So perhaps this part is ambiguous and thus excluded. \n\nTherefore, the first condition is that the user must have receivesBenefit for at least one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld+Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen). However, for Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag, it's two separate benefits. So the user must have receivesBenefit for both? Or either?\n\nThe text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" as one bullet. So perhaps the user must have both. So for that bullet, it's a combination. But how to model that in SHACL? The user must have receivesBenefit for Wohngeld AND receivesBenefit for Kinderzuschlag. So that would be a combination. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's either of them, but the German uses \"und\" which is \"and\". So the user must receive both. \n\nHmm, that complicates it. So for the second bullet, the user must have both Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag. \n\nPutting this together, the first part requires that the user has receivesBenefit for at least one of the following:\n\n- Bürgergeld,\n\n- Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag (both),\n\n- Sozialhilfe,\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen.\n\nAlternatively, the second bullet is a separate condition, so the user can choose any of the four options. \n\nSo the user must have receivesBenefit for at least one of these four options. But for the second option, it's a combination. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second bullet is a single benefit that combines Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag. Since the ontology has them as separate, perhaps it's better to model that the user must have receivesBenefit for both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have receivesBenefit for either Wohngeld or Kinderzuschlag. But the text says \"und\", so maybe it's both. \n\nThis is ambiguous. Since the ontology has them as separate, perhaps the user must have both. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have at least one of the listed benefits, where the second bullet is a combined benefit. Since it's unclear, perhaps it's better to model it as the user must have receivesBenefit for at least one of the four: \n\n- Bürgergeld,\n\n- Wohngeld,\n\n- Kinderzuschlag,\n\n- Sozialhilfe,\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen,\n\nBut the original text groups Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag together. Maybe it's either/or. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have receivesBenefit for at least one of the four bullet points, where the second bullet requires both Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag. \n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I need to proceed step by step, considering possible SHACL constraints.\n\nAnother part of the requirement says: \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann, hat die Möglichkeit, seinen individuellen Anspruch auf Bildungs- und Teilhabeleistungen prüfen zu lassen.\" → If the user doesn't get any of the listed benefits, but can't cover the costs themselves, they can apply for review. But this seems like an additional condition where eligibility is possible but requires an assessment, which can't be modeled (since it's at the discretion of an authority). Thus this part is excluded.\n\nThe next condition is age: up to 25 years old. So hasAge < 25 (maxExclusive 25).\n\nAdditionally, \"Leistungen zur Teilhabe am sozialen und kulturellen Leben in der Gemeinschaft werden bis zur Vollendung des 18. Lebensjahres bezuschusst.\" → Participation benefits up to age 18. But this seems like an upper limit for a subset of benefits, not an eligibility requirement. Since the overall benefit applies up to 25, but this part specifies up to 18 for some parts. Since it's part of the description but not an eligibility requirement for the user, maybe it's not part of the SHACL constraints.\n\nNow, putting together the constraints:\n\n1. User must be under 25 years old (hasAge < 25)\n\n2. User must receive one of the following benefits:\n\n   a) Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931)\n\n   b) Wohngeld (ff:L100040_LB_8665924) AND Kinderzuschlag (ff:B100019_LB_581863)\n\n   c) Sozialhilfe (ff:SocialAssistance)\n\n   d) Asylbewerberleistungen (ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n\nOR\n\nThe user must belong to a family with low income (but this can't be modeled as we don't have the data property for that, so excluded)\n\nAlternatively, if the second bullet is either Wohngeld or Kinderzuschlag, then it's OR.\n\nBut given the German text uses \"und\", it's safer to assume the user must have both. \n\nSo for the Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag part, the user must have receivesBenefit for both.\n\nSo the SHACL needs to check that the user has receivesBenefit for at least one of the following:\n\n- Bürgergeld,\n\n- (Wohngeld AND Kinderzuschlag),\n\n- Sozialhilfe,\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen.\n\nSo this can be modeled as a disjunction of these four possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, since SHACL allows using sh:or, perhaps structure the shape as:\n\nThe user must have receivesBenefit for at least one of the four options, each of which is a condition.\n\nSo:\n\nOption1: has receivesBenefit to Bürgergeld.\n\nOption2: has receivesBenefit to Wohngeld AND receivesBenefit to Kinderzuschlag.\n\nOption3: has receivesBenefit to Sozialhilfe.\n\nOption4: has receivesBenefit to Asylbewerberleistungen.\n\nThus, the SHACL could use sh:or with these four conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the user's age must be under 25.\n\nNow, in SHACL, how to represent this.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the benefit (ff:L100040_LB_12280162) would have a NodeShape targeting ff:User.\n\nThe constraints would include:\n\n- The age condition (hasAge <25)\n\n- The disjunction of the four benefit conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the second part of the text mentions that if the user doesn't receive any of the listed benefits, they can have their eligibility reviewed if they can't cover costs. But this is a conditional path that requires assessment, so it's excluded.\n\nNow, let's map to the ontology terms:\n\nThe benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld: ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n\n- Wohngeld: ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n\n- Kinderzuschlag: ff:B100019_LB_581863\n\n- Sozialhilfe: ff:SocialAssistance\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen: ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits\n\nNow, the SHACL shape for the benefit:\n\nFirst, define the SocialBenefit individual:\n\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\nThen, create a NodeShape for the benefit's constraints.\n\nThe main shape:\n\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    # The disjunction of the four conditions\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ] ]\n            # For option2: receives both Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 2 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapesDisjoint true ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes ( [ sh:hasClass ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ] [ sh:hasClass ff:B100019_LB_581863 ] )\n            ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ] ]\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] ]\n        )\n    ] .\n\nWait, but for the second option (Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag), how to check that the user has receivesBenefit for both?\n\nIn SHACL, to have both, you can use a qualified property with minCount 2 and specify the two values.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:and?\n\nWait, perhaps using a qualified property where the user's receivesBenefit must have two values: one of type Wohngeld and one of type Kinderzuschlag.\n\nSo:\n\nFor the second condition (Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag), the user must have two receivesBenefit triples where one is of type Wohngeld and another of type Kinderzuschlag.\n\nThus, the qualifiedValueShapes would be two shapes, each requiring their respective class.\n\nSo:\n\nThe second condition's property is:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 2 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShapesDisjoint true ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShapes (\n        [ sh:class ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]  # Wohngeld\n        [ sh:class ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]   # Kinderzuschlag\n    )\n]\n\nBut this would require that the user has at least two receivesBenefit statements, one for each of those classes. That should work.\n\nAlternatively, the qualifiedValueShapesDisjoint might not be necessary here, but it's safer to include.\n\nThus, the sh:or clause would have four elements, each being a condition for one of the four options.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main shape's sh:or would have four parts:\n\n1. receives Bürgergeld\n\n2. receives both Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag\n\n3. receives Sozialhilfe\n\n4. receives Asylbewerberleistungen\n\nThus, the SHACL shape would have a sh:or with these four conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the age condition is separate.\n\nAnother consideration: the requirement says \"junge Menschen\" (young people), so maybe the age is required to be under 25, which is covered.\n\nNow, checking for other possible conditions.\n\nThe problem statement also mentions that the benefit is for \"Kinder und junge Menschen bis zur Vollendung des 25. Lebensjahres\", so the age is correct.\n\nThe other parts about the family's income can't be modeled, so we exclude them.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include the age constraint and the disjunction of the four benefit conditions.\n\nNow, let's structure the Turtle code.\n\nFirst, define the SocialBenefit individual:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\nThen the NodeShape:\n\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # Age under 25\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"Age must be under 25 years.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # The disjunction of the four conditions\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            # Condition 1: receives Bürgergeld\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n            ] ]\n            # Condition 2: receives both Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 2 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapesDisjoint true ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes (\n                    [ sh:class ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]  # Wohngeld\n                    [ sh:class ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]   # Kinderzuschlag\n                )\n            ] ]\n            # Condition 3: receives Sozialhilfe\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance\n            ] ]\n            # Condition 4: receives Asylbewerberleistungen\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits\n            ] ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must receive one of the listed benefits or their family must.\"@en\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the second condition (Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag) requires both to be present. The qualified approach should work.\n\nAdditionally, each condition in the sh:or is a separate property shape. Each of the four items in sh:or is a sh:property with the respective condition.\n\nAlternatively, the first condition (Bürgergeld) can be expressed as:\n\nsh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nThis should model the conditions correctly.\n\nI think this covers the requirements as per the ontology and the given text.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# SocialBenefit metadata\nff:L100040_LB_12280162 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Bildung und Teilhabe\"@de, \"Education and Participation\"@en .\n\n# Main shape targeting the user\nff:BildungUndTeilhabeShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Age under 25\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive \"25\"^^xsd:int ;\n        sh:message \"Applicant must be under 25 years old.\"@en\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Must receive one of the listed benefits\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            # Bürgergeld (SGB II)\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n            ] ]\n            \n            # Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§6b BKGG) - requires both benefits\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 2 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapesDisjoint true ;\n                sh:qualifiedValueShapes (\n                    [ sh:class ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ]  # Wohngeld\n                    [ sh:class ff:B100019_LB_581863 ]   # Kinderzuschlag\n                )\n            ] ]\n            \n            # Sozialhilfe (SGB XII)\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance\n            ] ]\n            \n            # Asylbewerberleistungen\n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits\n            ] ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must receive one of the listed benefits: Bürgergeld, Wohngeld+Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, or Asylbewerberleistungen.\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this SHACL validation graph for the given social benefit. The benefit is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' with IDLB B100019_LB_582404. The user description says that if someone is legally insured against accidents, they can claim this pension under certain conditions. The requirements are:\n\n1. Their earning capacity (Erwerbsfähigkeit) is reduced by at least 20%:\n   - Due to one or more insurance events (Versicherungsfälle),\n   - Beyond the 26th week after the insurance event.\n\nFirst, I need to translate these requirements into SHACL constraints. Let's break them down step by step.\n\nStarting with the first requirement: The user must have a reduced earning capacity. Looking at the ontology, there's an EarningCapacity class with subclasses like ReducedEarningCapacity and UnfitForWork. The property ff:hasEarningCapacity links a Person to their earning capacity status. So the user must have an EarningCapacity that is not FullEarningCapacity.\n\nNext, the reduction must be at least 20%. The ontology has a data property ff:reductionInPercent on EarningCapacity. So we need to check that this value is >= 20.\n\nThe reduction must be due to an insurance event. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent which links EarningCapacity to an Event. The insurance events are subclasses of Event, like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc. So the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of these. However, in SHACL, we can't directly check the type of the object, but maybe using a sh:class constraint if the event is known. Alternatively, perhaps the insurance event is linked via another property. Wait, the insurance events are subclasses of ff:Event. So maybe the triggeringEvent must be an instance of one of those subclasses. But since SHACL doesn't support class checks directly, unless the ontology has specific individuals, this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe the insurance event is linked via another property, but looking at the ontology, ff:triggeringEvent's domain includes EarningCapacity, so the event must be an insurance-related event. Since the user must have at least one such event, perhaps we can model this with a path requiring that the triggeringEvent exists, and maybe that event is part of the insurance cases. Hmm, but without knowing the exact type, perhaps we can't enforce it. Wait, maybe the ontology has an Insurance class? Wait, looking back, the Insurance class has a label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung\" which is statutory accident insurance. The user must be insured under that, so maybe they have ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. But the requirement says \"if they are legally insured\", so perhaps that's a separate condition. The problem is that the user must be insured, but the SHACL needs to validate their data. So first, the user must have ff:hasInsurance including StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nWait, the first part of the text says \"Wenn Sie gesetzlich unfallversichert sind\" (if you are legally insured against accidents). So the first condition is that the user has this insurance. Then, the other requirements. So:\n\n1. User must have ff:hasInsurance including ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n2. Their earning capacity is reduced (hasEarningCapacity is not FullEarningCapacity)\n3. The reduction is at least 20% (reductionInPercent >= 20)\n4. The reduction is due to an insurance event (triggeringEvent exists and is an insurance-related event)\n5. The reduction is beyond the 26th week after the event. The reductionDurationInWeeks must be >26. The ontology has ff:reductionDurationInWeeks on EarningCapacity, which counts how many weeks the reduction has been ongoing. So that needs to be >26.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"über die 26. Woche nach dem Versicherungsfall hinaus\" meaning beyond the 26th week after the insurance event. So the duration must be more than 26 weeks. So reductionDurationInWeeks >26.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape must target ff:User and include constraints for each of these points.\n\nLet me check the ontology again for the properties.\n\nff:hasInsurance's range is ff:Insurance, and ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance is an individual of that class. So the user must have an ff:hasInsurance link to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nFor the earning capacity:\n\n- ff:hasEarningCapacity must have a value that is not ff:FullEarningCapacity. So in SHACL, we can use sh:not with sh:hasValue.\n\nBut maybe better to check that the reductionInPercent is at least 20. So:\n\nThe EarningCapacity must have ff:reductionInPercent >= 20.\n\nAdditionally, the triggeringEvent must exist (so ff:triggeringEvent has at least one value), but the exact type of event (like WorkAccident) might not be enforceable via SHACL unless the ontology has specific instances. Since the requirement just states \"due to one or more insurance events\", which are types of ff:Event, perhaps that's sufficient. So we just need to ensure that the triggeringEvent exists (so sh:minCount 1 on that path).\n\nThe reductionDurationInWeeks must be >26.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have several properties:\n\n1. For the insurance:\n   - sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasInsurance; sh:minCount 1; sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance; ]\n\n2. For earning capacity:\n   - The user must have an EarningCapacity instance. So:\n     sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity; sh:minCount 1; ... ]\n\n   Within that, check that the reductionInPercent is >=20:\n   - So the EarningCapacity's ff:reductionInPercent must be >=20. To do this, we can use sh:property within the shape for hasEarningCapacity.\n\n   Also, the triggeringEvent must exist (sh:minCount 1 on ff:triggeringEvent).\n\n   And reductionDurationInWeeks >26.\n\nPutting this together using SHACL's nested properties:\n\nThe main shape for the benefit would target the user, and have properties that check these conditions.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, the shape for the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance pension\"@en .\n\nThe node shape would be something like ff:UnfallRentenShape.\n\nThen:\n\nff:UnfallRentenShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: has statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Must be insured under statutory accident insurance\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: has earning capacity with reduction\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Check reductionInPercent >=20\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Check reductionDurationInWeeks >26\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # Since >26 means 27 or more\n            sh:message \"Reduction duration must be more than 26 weeks\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Check that triggeringEvent exists\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"Must have a triggering insurance event\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the ff:hasEarningCapacity is a property of the user pointing to an EarningCapacity instance. So the sh:property block under hasEarningCapacity is using the path within that EarningCapacity node. So the structure is correct.\n\nHowever, SHACL's nested properties can handle this. Each inner sh:property is applied to the objects of the outer path (ff:hasEarningCapacity).\n\nAlso, the user must have at least one EarningCapacity instance, which is enforced by sh:minCount 1 on hasEarningCapacity.\n\nAdditionally, the EarningCapacity must not be FullEarningCapacity. But since the reduction is at least 20%, that's covered by the reductionInPercent check. However, maybe the type of EarningCapacity (like ReducedEarningCapacity) should also be considered. But the ontology's EarningCapacity has subclasses like Reduced and UnfitForWork. So perhaps the EarningCapacity's rdf:type must not be FullEarningCapacity, but maybe it's redundant since the reduction is already checked. However, to be thorough, maybe add a check that the EarningCapacity is not FullEarningCapacity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the existence of reductionInPercent implies it's not full, but in the ontology, maybe FullEarningCapacity doesn't have a reduction. So perhaps that's already covered.\n\nAlternatively, the user's hasEarningCapacity must not be FullEarningCapacity. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:not [\n        sh:hasValue ff:FullEarningCapacity ;\n    ] ;\n]\n\nBut combining this with the existing properties on hasEarningCapacity might require more complex nesting. Maybe better to include it as an additional constraint on hasEarningCapacity's value.\n\nAlternatively, the existing checks (reductionInPercent >=20 and reductionDuration) would implicitly ensure that it's not full. But perhaps better to include it explicitly.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"Erwerbsfähigkeit ist gemindert\" which means \"earning capacity is reduced\". So the EarningCapacity must be a reduced one. So the EarningCapacity must be an instance of ReducedEarningCapacity or similar. But in the ontology, there's an individual ReducedEarningCapacity. However, checking the type in SHACL is tricky because SHACL doesn't have a class constraint unless using sh:class. But since the ontology uses RDFS classes, maybe we can use sh:class. Wait, SHACL's sh:class is part of SHACL-SPARQL which is not core. The user instructions say to use only SHACL Core components. Therefore, we can't use sh:class. So perhaps we can't enforce the type, but the reductionInPercent check would suffice as the FullEarningCapacity probably doesn't have that property, but not sure. To be safe, maybe it's better to just rely on the reductionInPercent check.\n\nTherefore, the current constraints should be sufficient.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL would include:\n\n- The insurance check\n- The earning capacity must have reductionInPercent >=20\n- reductionDurationInWeeks >26\n- triggeringEvent exists\n\nNow, let me make sure all the properties are correctly named according to the ontology.\n\nChecking ontology:\n\n- ff:hasInsurance's range is ff:Insurance, and ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance is an individual of that class. Correct.\n\n- ff:reductionInPercent is a data property of ff:EarningCapacity. Yes.\n\n- ff:reductionDurationInWeeks is also a data property of ff:EarningCapacity. Correct.\n\n- ff:triggeringEvent is an object property with domain EarningCapacity, range Event. So exists.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape should be structured as follows.\n\nAlso, the shape should have a checksFundingRequirement pointing to the benefit, as in the example.\n\nWait, the example had:\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102713860 ;\n\nSo for this benefit, the shape would have:\n\nff:UnfallRentenShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582404 ;\n\nPutting all together:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance pension\"@en .\n\nff:UnfallRentenShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582404 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be insured under statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Check earning capacity conditions\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ; # Must have at least one earning capacity\n        sh:message \"User must have an earning capacity assessment.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction in percent >=20\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction duration >26 weeks\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # Must be over 26 weeks\n            sh:message \"Reduction duration must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Must have a triggering event (insurance event)\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"Must have a triggering insurance event.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the triggeringEvent is a property of the EarningCapacity, so the inner sh:property is correct.\n\nThis should cover all the requirements except possibly the \"due to one or more insurance events\", which is covered by the existence of triggeringEvent (since that's the insurance event that caused the earning capacity reduction).\n\nI think this covers all the necessary conditions. Let me double-check the requirements:\n\n1. Gesetzlich unfallversichert: Check via hasInsurance with StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n2. Erwerbsfähigkeit gemindert (reduced earning capacity):\n\n   - reductionInPercent >=20 (check done)\n\n   - über die 26. Woche (reductionDurationInWeeks >26: check done via 27+)\n\n   - infolge Versicherungsfälle: the triggeringEvent must be an insurance event (which is the case as triggeringEvent is linked, but maybe it's redundant as the insurance event is part of the accident insurance's domain, but in SHACL we can't enforce the event's type beyond existence. Since the requirement just states that the reduction must be due to such an event, the existence of the triggeringEvent is sufficient here.)\n\nThus, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance pension\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:UnfallRentenShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582404 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Requirement 1: Must be insured under statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance coverage.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n\n    # Requirement 2: Earning capacity must meet reduction criteria\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must have an evaluated earning capacity status.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction must be at least 20%\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Reduction duration must exceed 26 weeks\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # >26 weeks means 27 or more\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must persist beyond 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            # Must have a triggering insurance event\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be caused by an insurance event.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the given social benefit based on the provided ontology and examples. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe benefit in question is the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' (Statutory accident insurance widow's pension) with IDLB B100019_LB_582441. The user must meet certain eligibility criteria to be eligible for this benefit.\n\nFirst, I'll translate the German text into English to better parse the conditions. The user is entitled if:\n\n1. The spouse or civil partner died due to an insurance event (work accident, commuting accident, occupational disease).\n2. The user was already in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership with the deceased before the insurance event.\n\nThey are not entitled if:\n\n- They entered the marriage/civil partnership after the insurance event, and the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nNow, I need to map these conditions to the ontology terms provided.\n\nStarting with the first condition: The deceased must have died due to one of the specified insurance events. Looking at the ontology, the relevant classes are ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, and ff:OccupationalDisease, all sub-classes of ff:Event. The property ff:causeOfDeath links a person to the event causing their death. So, the deceased's causeOfDeath must be one of these classes.\n\nSecond, the user must have been in a legal union (marriage or civil partnership) with the deceased before the insurance event. The ontology has the ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent property, which links an event to another person (the user here). So, the event (the causeOfDeath event) must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nThird, the deceased must have had statutory accident insurance. The ontology includes ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an individual of ff:Insurance. The user's deceased spouse/partner (linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner) must have ff:hasInsurance set to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nNow, the exclusion part: If the user entered the union after the event, and death within first year. However, the example solution excluded ambiguous or third-party determined conditions (like \"in der Regel\" which is a bit vague). The exclusion here mentions \"in der Regel\", so maybe that's why the example excluded it. The user should not have the marriage/civil partnership after the event, so the legalUnionBeforeEvent must exist before the event. But how to represent that in SHACL?\n\nWait, the exclusion is phrased as \"if they entered the marriage after the event and death within first year\". So to exclude those cases, the SHACL should ensure that the legal union was before the event. But how to model that? The ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent property's existence already implies that the user was in the union before the event. Because the domain of ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent is ff:Event, and it points to the user, meaning the user was in the union before the event. Therefore, including that property ensures the union was before. So the exclusion condition is already covered by requiring the presence of legalUnionBeforeEvent. Therefore, the exclusion is redundant here because the presence of legalUnionBeforeEvent means the union was before the event. So maybe the exclusion is not necessary to model as it's already implied by the eligibility condition. Hence, we can ignore the exclusion part since it's a negative condition that's already covered by the positive condition.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes:\n\nThe target node is ff:User. The shape should check that the user has either a deceased spouse or civil partner, each of which must meet certain conditions.\n\nUsing sh:or for the two possibilities (deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner). For each, we need to qualify the value shapes.\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one of the deceased partners (spouse or civil partner). For each, the deceased must have the causeOfDeath as one of the allowed events, and have the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user. Also, the deceased must have the statutory accident insurance.\n\nWait, the legalUnionBeforeEvent is a property of the event (causeOfDeath), right? Because the event (e.g., work accident) must have the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user (the surviving partner). So the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent must be the user.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe shape starts with an or condition for the two deceased relations (spouse or civil partner). Each of these deceased individuals must have:\n\n- hasInsurance including StatutoryAccidentInsurance (so they were insured)\n- their causeOfDeath is an event (work accident, commuting, or occupational disease), and that event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nWait, actually, the causeOfDeath is an event, so the causeOfDeath of the deceased is the event (work accident etc.). That event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user (since the user was in the union before the event).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. User has deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner (at least one)\n2. For each such deceased:\n   a. They must have StatutoryAccidentInsurance via ff:hasInsurance.\n   b. Their causeOfDeath must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n   c. The causeOfDeath event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL would structure this with qualified value shapes.\n\nBreaking down into SHACL components:\n\nThe main shape (ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape) targets ff:User and has an sh:or condition for the two deceased relationships.\n\nEach of those paths (ff:deceasedSpouse and ff:deceasedCivilPartner) must have a qualified value shape (ff:DeceasedPartnerShape) with min count 1.\n\nThe DeceasedPartnerShape requires:\n\n- hasInsurance must include StatutoryAccidentInsurance (so a property with sh:hasValue)\n- causeOfDeath must link to an event (the insurance event) which must be one of the three types (WorkAccident etc.), and that event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nWait, how to combine the two conditions on the causeOfDeath event?\n\nThe causeOfDeath must be an instance of one of the three classes, and the event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent with the user.\n\nSo in SHACL terms, the node for the causeOfDeath must be a member of one of those classes, and must have the legalUnionBeforeEvent property with the user.\n\nTherefore, for the DeceasedPartnerShape's causeOfDeath property, we need a node shape that enforces both the class and the legalUnionBeforeEvent.\n\nSo:\n\nThe DeceasedPartnerShape has a property for ff:causeOfDeath, which must exist (minCount 1), and the node for that causeOfDeath must conform to a shape (ff:InsuranceEventShape).\n\nThe InsuranceEventShape has two conditions:\n\n- The class must be one of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease (using sh:or and sh:class)\n- The event must have ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent with the user (sh:in (ff:User)), since the legalUnionBeforeEvent is a property of the event, pointing to the user.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL should look similar to the example provided, but ensuring all conditions are met. Let me check the example again to see the structure.\n\nIn the example, the DeceasedPartnerShape has a property for causeOfDeath requiring it to link to an InsuranceEventShape, which includes the class check and the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user. That's exactly what we need.\n\nNow, the data properties and other terms must be from the ontology. Also, the shapes must use SHACL Core components only.\n\nI need to make sure that all the properties and classes used are present in the ontology. For example, ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent is an object property with domain ff:Event and range ff:Person, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should look like the example, but with the correct IDs and structure. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, the metadata for the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582441 is the SocialBenefit individual.\n\nThe main shape (ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape) targets ff:User and uses sh:or for the deceasedSpouse and deceasedCivilPartner paths, each with their qualified value shapes.\n\nThe DeceasedPartnerShape requires:\n\n- hasInsurance must have ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance (sh:hasValue)\n- causeOfDeath must point to an InsuranceEventShape.\n\nThe InsuranceEventShape requires:\n\n- sh:or for the three event classes\n- legalUnionBeforeEvent must have the user (sh:in (ff:User))\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's any missing part.\n\nWait, the example used sh:in (ff:User) for legalUnionBeforeEvent. Since the legalUnionBeforeEvent is an object property pointing to a person (the user), the sh:in (ff:User) ensures that the value is exactly the user node. That's correct.\n\nYes, that should work. The exclusion part is not included because it's considered ambiguous (\"in der Regel\") or a negative condition already covered by requiring the legalUnionBeforeEvent.\n\nNow, serializing this into Turtle as per the example, making sure all prefixes are correct and syntax is valid.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582441 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance widow's pension\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:GUVWitwenrenteShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n        [ \n            sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DeceasedPartnerShape ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1\n        ]\n    ) .\n\nff:DeceasedPartnerShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"The deceased must have statutory accident insurance\"@en\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node ff:InsuranceEventShape ;\n        sh:message \"Death not caused by valid insurance event or legal union not established before the event\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:InsuranceEventShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n        [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ]\n        [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:User ) ;\n        sh:message \"No legal union before the insurance event\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

Arbeitslosigkeit ist dabei keine Voraussetzung.\n  * Sie müssen den Antrag vor der tatsächlichen Aufnahme der Erwerbstätigkeit bei Ihrem Jobcenter stellen.\n  * Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung ist geeignet, dass Sie perspektivisch Ihre Hilfebedürftigkeit überwinden.\n  * Das Einstiegsgeld ist für Ihre Eingliederung in den allgemeinen Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich.\n  * Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzungen bei Selbständigkeit/ Existenzgründung:\n\n  * Positive Bewertung des Jobcenters über \n    * Ihre persönliche Eignung,\n    * die wirtschaftliche Tragfähigkeit Ihrer selbständigen Tätigkeit\n\nSOLUTION:\nStep 1 - Understand the input text. Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Einstiegsgeld (DE) / Introductory allowance (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102713860\nRequirements text (EN): * You will receive citizen benefit before starting your new job. Unemployment is not a prerequisite.\n* You must submit the application to your Jobcenter before actually taking up employment.\n* Your new self-employment or your new job is suitable for overcoming your need for assistance in the long term.\n* The introductory allowance is necessary for your integration into the general labor market.\n* Your employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditional requirements for self-employment/starting up a business:\n\n* Positive assessment by the Jobcenter of \n  * Your personal suitability,\n  * the economic viability of your self-employed activity\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax. Model only the GREEN and YELLOW requirements using ontology terms and SHACL Core components.

Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5. The new job is suitable for addressing the user's need for assistance in the long term (RED: depends on requirement 2; \"suitable\" is ambiguous).\n6. The introductory allowance is necessary for the user's integration into the general labor market (RED: \"necessary\" is ambiguous).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Ausbildungsgeld' (Training Allowance) with the IDLB B100019_LB_574711 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements and translating them into the ontology terms provided.\n\nFirst, the requirements are:\n\n1. The user has a disability and their responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency.\n2. The user will participate in one of the specified measures (e.g., vocational training, preparatory education, etc.).\n3. The user has no entitlement to the transitional allowance.\n\nLet me break down each requirement and see which ontology classes and properties apply.\n\nStarting with the first requirement: \"Sie haben eine Behinderung und Ihr zuständiger Rehabilitationsträger ist die Bundesagentur für Arbeit.\"\n\n- \"Behinderung\" translates to ff:Disability. The user must have a disability. The ontology has a data property ff:hasDisability which is a boolean. So we can check that this is true.\n- The rehabilitation provider (ff:hasRehabilitationProvider) must be the Federal Employment Agency (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). \n\nSecond requirement: Participation in certain measures. The specified measures include:\n- (first) vocational training (ff:VocationalTraining? Or another subclass)\n- preparatory education including basic training (maybe part of ff:Training? The ontology has ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which is a subclass of Training, which matches \"Eingangsverfahren oder Berufsbildungsbereich\".\n- individual company-based qualification in supported employment (not sure the exact class, but perhaps under Training or VocationalTraining)\n- The listed options are all under the Training class or its subclasses. So the participation should be checked via ff:participates in a Training instance that is one of these types. However, the ontology might not have all the subclasses, so maybe just check that they have a participation in a Training, but need to ensure that the specific types are covered. Wait, looking at the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology, there's ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which is a subclass of Training, which matches one of the listed measures. The others like VocationalTraining (ff:VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training) might also be included. Since the requirement says \"participate in one of the following measures\", the exact type might be necessary. But perhaps the participation in any of the specific Training subclasses is sufficient. However, since the exact classes aren't all listed in the ontology, maybe the participation in any Training is sufficient? Or maybe the user's participation in a Training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency? Hmm, but the problem says \"die folgenden Maßnahmen teilnehmen\" which are specific types. Since the ontology includes ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and VocationalTraining (as a subclass of Training), perhaps the shape can check that they have a participation in a Training object, but maybe with additional constraints. Alternatively, maybe the participation is sufficient if the user is in any Training, but the exact measure might be part of the Training's properties. Since the examples only included direct participation, perhaps the main point is that they participate in a Training.\n\nThe third requirement: \"Sie haben keinen Anspruch auf Übergangsgeld.\" \n\nThe Übergangsgeld is listed as the social benefit ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (from the ontology's individual list). The user must not be eligible for this benefit. So, they should not have ff:isEligibleFor this benefit. Alternatively, maybe they are not receiving it, but the requirement says \"no entitlement\", so it's about eligibility. So the user must not have an ff:isEligibleFor link to that benefit.\n\nNow, considering the rules for SHACL:\n\n- Use only SHACL Core components.\n- Exclude requirements that are ambiguous or at discretion of third parties.\n\nNow, let's check each condition:\n\n1. Disability and correct rehabilitation provider: these are straightforward checks. The user must have a hasDisability true, and their hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency. \n\n2. Participation in the specified measures. Since the exact measures are listed, but the ontology might not have all the subclasses, perhaps the participation in any Training is acceptable, but need to ensure the specific types are covered. For example, the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is present. The VocationalTraining is also present. Since the user needs to be participating in one of those, the participation in a Training is a valid check. The problem is that the user might be in any Training, but according to the requirement, only certain types are allowed. However, since the ontology might not have all those specific subclasses, maybe it's acceptable to just check that they are participating in a Training (ff:participates) with a node of type Training. Alternatively, maybe there's another property. Let me check the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology's Training subclasses:\n\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea (matches the fourth bullet)\n- School (maybe not relevant here)\n- VocationalTraining (matches first bullet)\n- There's also ff:TrainingBudget which is a SocialBenefit, but not directly relevant.\n\nSo the possible Training subclasses that fit are VocationalTraining and EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The second bullet includes \"berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme\", which might be under another subclass, but perhaps in the ontology, the closest is Training. Since the exact types might not all be present, maybe the participation in a Training is sufficient. So the SHACL constraint would require that the user has at least one participation in a Training. \n\n3. No entitlement to Übergangsgeld: This is a negation. The user must not have an isEligibleFor link to ff:B100019_LB_102716305. In SHACL, this can be done with sh:property with sh:hasValue and sh:maxCount 0, or using sh:not. Wait, SHACL has sh:property with sh:disjoint. Alternatively, using sh:property with sh:hasValue and sh:maxCount 0.\n\nNow, let's structure the SHACL shapes.\n\nThe target is ff:User.\n\nFirst, the NodeShape for the benefit:\n\nThe benefit is ff:B100019_LB_574711, so we need to create a shape for it.\n\nBut in SHACL, the shapes are usually named as the shape, but the example had a shape named with the benefit's German name. So perhaps:\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        ... constraints ...\n    ] .\n\nEach requirement becomes a sh:property constraint.\n\n1. Disability and rehabilitation provider:\n\n- hasDisability is true:\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability\n    sh:minCount 1\n    sh:hasValue true\n\nBut since it's a data property, the user must have a triple like user ff:hasDisability true.\n\n- hasRehabilitationProvider must be exactly ff:FederalEmploymentAgency:\n\nsh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider\nsh:minCount 1\nsh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n\n2. Participation in Training:\n\nThe user must have at least one participation in a Training:\n\nsh:path ff:participates\nsh:class ff:Training\nsh:minCount 1\n\nWait, but the path is ff:participates, and the range is Training. So the object must be of type Training. So by specifying sh:class, we ensure that the target is of that class. Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to have the participation, but the ontology's range is already Training, so maybe just checking that the user has at least one participates in something (since the range is Training, the object is automatically a Training). Wait, the ontology says ff:participates has Domain Person, Range Training. So the object is a Training instance. So the existence of any participates is sufficient. But the user must be participating in one of the specific types of measures. However, since the ontology might not have all the subclasses, perhaps the requirement is just to be in any Training. The problem says \"an einer der folgenden Maßnahmen teilnehmen\", which are all under Training's subclasses. But given the ontology's classes, we can only check that it's a Training, since the exact subclasses might not be fully represented. So proceed with that.\n\n3. No entitlement to Übergangsgeld:\n\nThe user must not have an isEligibleFor relation to the benefit ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (which is the Übergangsgeld).\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:maxCount 0 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n    sh:message \"User must not be eligible for Übergangsgeld\"@en ;\n]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:disjoint:\n\nBut SHACL Core doesn't have sh:disjoint, but you can use sh:property with sh:maxCount 0 and sh:hasValue.\n\nWait, the correct way is:\n\nTo require that the user does NOT have any triples where they have ff:isEligibleFor the specific benefit.\n\nSo the constraint is that the property ff:isEligibleFor must NOT have a value of that benefit. So the path is ff:isEligibleFor, and the hasValue is the benefit, with maxCount 0.\n\nSo the constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:maxCount 0 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n    sh:message \"User cannot have eligibility for Übergangsgeld\"@en ;\n]\n\nPutting it all together, the NodeShape would have three properties:\n\n- hasDisability must be true\n- hasRehabilitationProvider is FederalEmploymentAgency\n- participates in at least one Training\n- isEligibleFor does not include the Übergangsgeld benefit.\n\nNow, check for any ambiguous conditions. The first two are clear. The participation in Training is okay if the ontology's Training class covers the required measures, which the problem states. The third condition is a negation which is clear.\n\nAlso, the example shows using sh:hasValue for a boolean property (hasDisability), which is correct.\n\nNow, the SHACL Turtle syntax:\n\nStart with prefixes, then the benefit declaration and the NodeShape.\n\nBenefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training Allowance\"@en .\n\nShape:\n\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Disability must be true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a disability\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Must participate in at least one Training\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;\n        sh:message \"User must be participating in a training program\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Must not be eligible for Übergangsgeld\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n        sh:message \"User must not be eligible for Übergangsgeld\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, the 'sh:class' on the participates path is redundant because the range of ff:participates is already Training, but including it ensures that the target is indeed of that type, which might be necessary in some cases. Alternatively, the sh:class is not needed here, but including it is safe.\n\nAlternatively, just check that there is at least one participates.\n\nWait, the path is ff:participates. The user must have at least one object that is a Training. Since the range is already Training, but maybe the actual instance might not be properly typed. So the sh:class ensures that the object is of type Training. So it's better to include that.\n\nDouble-check the ontology for ff:participates:\n\nObjectProperty: ff:participates\n    Domain: ff:Person\n    Range: ff:Training \n\nSo the range is Training, so the object must be a Training instance. Therefore, the sh:class is redundant here, but including it won't hurt and ensures correctness.\n\nNow, check all conditions. The example's solution for another benefit used hasValue with a social benefit instance for the 'receivesBenefit' property. Similarly here, the isEligibleFor needs to exclude that benefit.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the final Turtle code.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training Allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:AusbildungsgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # User must have a disability\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # User must participate in a training program\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;\n        sh:message \"User is not participating in any training program\"@en ;\n    ],\n    sh:property [\n        # User must not be eligible for Übergangsgeld\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for Übergangsgeld and cannot receive this benefit\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the unemployment benefit 'Arbeitslosengeld' (B100019_LB_576842). Let's start by understanding the requirements given in German and then translate them into conditions that can be checked using the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, the user must be unemployed. According to the ontology, unemployment is represented by the class 'Unemployed' under employment status. The condition mentions that the user is not in an employment relationship or works less than 15 hours a week and is available for placement. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the property ff:hasEmploymentStatus links a person to their employment status. So, the user's employment status should be 'Unemployed' (ff:Unemployed). Also, the 'availableForPlacement' data property is present, which matches the requirement about being available for the employment agency's efforts. So, we need to check that ff:availableForPlacement is true.\n\nNext, the registration requirement: the user must have registered as unemployed electronically or in person. The ontology has ff:registeredUnemployed as an employment status individual. Wait, actually, the ontology has 'RegisteredUnemployed' as an employment status type. The user should have this status. So, the employment status must be ff:RegisteredUnemployed.\n\nThen, the 12 months of compulsory insurance within 30 months before registration. The property ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is a data property that's true if this condition is met. So, we need to ensure that this property is true for the user.\n\nNow, checking which requirements can be modeled. The registration part (electronic or in person) might depend on some action taken, but since the ontology has the employment status as RegisteredUnemployed, that should suffice. The 12/30 months is covered by the data property. \n\nThe part about considering other periods like when receiving substitute payments (Krankengeld) or caring for a relative might be too detailed, but the ontology's ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 probably encapsulates that, so we don't need to model each case individually.\n\nThe work hours part: if they work less than 15 hours, then they still count as unemployed. The ontology has ff:workHoursPerWeek on Employment. So, if they have an employment, its workHoursPerWeek must be less than 15. But since employment status could be 'Unemployed', perhaps this is already covered by the employment status being Unemployed or the availableForPlacement being true.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape should target ff:User and check:\n\n1. Employment status is either Unemployed or RegisteredUnemployed (or just RegisteredUnemployed as that implies being unemployed and registered? Need to check ontology. Looking at the ontology, ff:RegisteredUnemployed is an EmploymentStatus individual. So, the user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus exactly RegisteredUnemployed.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"Sie arbeitslos sind, das heißt, ... und Sie stehen den Vermittlungsbemühungen zur Verfügung.\" So being unemployed and available for placement. The employment status should be 'Unemployed' but also must have availableForPlacement true. Alternatively, maybe the RegisteredUnemployed is the correct status here because that includes being registered and available. Let me check the ontology description of ff:RegisteredUnemployed: \"A person has officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\" So perhaps the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, which covers being unemployed and registered. But the availableForPlacement is a separate data property. Hmm. The problem says \"availableForPlacement must be true\".\n\nThe requirement says: \"Sie stehen den Vermittlungsbemühungen der Agentur für Arbeit zur Verfügung. Sie sind also in der Lage und bereit, eine versicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung unter arbeitsmarktüblichen Bedingungen aufzunehmen;\" which is exactly what the data property ff:availableForPlacement represents. So the user must have availableForPlacement set to true.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus = RegisteredUnemployed (since that's the status for registered unemployed, which includes being unemployed and registered, but maybe availableForPlacement is separate)\nWait, maybe the employment status should be Unemployed, and also have registered as unemployed (RegisteredUnemployed?), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me check the ontology again:\n\nLooking at the ontology's Individuals:\n\n- ff:Unemployed is an EmploymentStatus with comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\"\n\n- ff:RegisteredUnemployed is an EmploymentStatus with comment: \"A person has officially registered as unemployed with the authorities.\"\n\nHmm, so perhaps the user must have both:\n\n1. Employment status is Unemployed (to satisfy being unemployed and available), and\n\n2. has registered (maybe via another property?), but the ontology doesn't have a direct property for registration. Alternatively, the RegisteredUnemployed status might be the one that combines being unemployed and registered. Wait, the description of RegisteredUnemployed says \"has officially registered as unemployed\", but it's an employment status. So maybe the correct approach is that the user's employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed. But then, how do we check availability? The availableForPlacement is a data property which the requirement also mentions. So perhaps both:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus is RegisteredUnemployed (covers registration and being unemployed), and\n\n- availableForPlacement is true (to ensure they are available for placement).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the RegisteredUnemployed status already implies availability? The description of Unemployed mentions availability, so maybe the employment status should be Unemployed and registered via another method. But since the ontology might not have a direct property for registration method, perhaps we can only check the employment status and availableForPlacement.\n\nWait the requirement says they must have registered (either electronically or in person). The ontology might not track the registration method, so perhaps the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed is sufficient to indicate they've registered. So the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed, and availableForPlacement is true.\n\nAdditionally, the 12 months within 30 must be covered by the data property ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 being true.\n\nPutting it all into SHACL:\n\nThe shape should have:\n\n- Employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed (sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed)\n\n- availableForPlacement must be true (sh:hasValue true)\n\n- compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true (sh:hasValue true)\n\nWait but in SHACL, for data properties, we can use sh:hasValue with the boolean. For object properties, sh:hasValue with the individual.\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have three properties:\n\n1. ff:hasEmploymentStatus must have value ff:RegisteredUnemployed\n\n2. ff:availableForPlacement must be true\n\n3. ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true\n\nAdditionally, the work hours: if they have an employment, it must be less than 15 hours per week. The requirement says \"Sie üben nur eine Erwerbstätigkeit in einem Umfang von weniger als 15 Stunden wöchentlich aus und ...\". So if they have an employment, then the workHoursPerWeek must be <15. However, if they are unemployed (RegisteredUnemployed), maybe they don't have an employment? Or perhaps they might still have part-time employment but less than 15 hours.\n\nWait the requirement says \"arbeitslos sind, das heißt, Sie stehen nicht in einem Beschäftigungsverhältnis oder Sie üben nur eine Erwerbstätigkeit in einem Umfang von weniger als 15 Stunden wöchentlich aus und ...\". So the unemployed condition is met either by not having employment, or having employment <15h and being available.\n\nSo in SHACL, we need to ensure that either:\n\n- The user has no employment (ff:hasEmployment is empty), OR\n\n- If they have an employment (ff:hasEmployment), then the workHoursPerWeek of that employment is less than 15.\n\nThis requires a more complex constraint. However, SHACL Core doesn't support OR conditions directly, but perhaps using sh:or?\n\nWait, SHACL Core components include sh:or, so maybe we can model it with two conditions in an OR.\n\nFirst, the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed (since that's part of being unemployed as per the requirement).\n\nBut also, for the employment part: either they have no employment, or if they do, the work hours are <15.\n\nWait, but the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed already implies that they are not in employment or in employment <15h and available. Maybe the employment status already covers this, so perhaps we don't need to check the employment's work hours separately. Because the RegisteredUnemployed status's definition includes that. Let me check:\n\nThe ontology's ff:Unemployed has a comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\"\n\nAh, so ff:Unemployed is the status that covers either no employment or <15h. But the user must also have registered, so maybe the employment status should be RegisteredUnemployed. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe the correct approach is to have the employment status as Unemployed and also registered. But since the ontology has RegisteredUnemployed as an employment status, perhaps that's the right one to use here, as it combines being registered and unemployed (with availability).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the employment status is Unemployed and they have the RegisteredUnemployed status? That might not make sense because employment status is a single property. The ontology allows ff:hasEmploymentStatus to link to one individual. So the user's employment status is RegisteredUnemployed, which would imply they are unemployed and registered, so the work hours condition is already included in that status's definition.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the main constraints are:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus = RegisteredUnemployed\n\n- availableForPlacement = true (maybe redundant?)\n\nWait, but the RegisteredUnemployed status's comment doesn't explicitly mention availability, while the Unemployed status does. Maybe the RegisteredUnemployed is just about registration, and availability is separate. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous, but given the ontology, perhaps the best approach is to model the three conditions:\n\n1. Employment status is Unemployed (to cover the unemployment and work hours)\n\n2. They are registered as unemployed (maybe via another property?), but the ontology might not have that directly. Alternatively, the employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed (which combines registration and unemployment status). But then availability is covered by availableForPlacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the employment status being RegisteredUnemployed is sufficient, and the availability is a separate check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have both:\n\nhasEmploymentStatus = Unemployed,\n\nand has registered (maybe via the property ff:registeredUnemployed?), but I don't see a property for that. The ontology's ff:RegisteredUnemployed is an individual of EmploymentStatus, so the user's employment status must be RegisteredUnemployed. That might be the correct path.\n\nAssuming that, the three main constraints are:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus = RegisteredUnemployed,\n\n- availableForPlacement is true,\n\n- compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is true.\n\nAdditionally, the requirement about registration method (electronic or in person) might not be modelable because the ontology doesn't track how they registered, just that they are registered (via the employment status).\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have these three conditions.\n\nNow, to structure the Turtle code:\n\nDefine the SocialBenefit individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ; rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\nThen the shape for this benefit:\n\nThe shape's target is ff:User, and it must meet all the constraints.\n\nSo:\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"Must have employment status RegisteredUnemployed.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must be available for placement.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must have 12 months of compulsory insurance in last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, data properties use sh:hasValue with the literal. So for availableForPlacement, which is a xsd:boolean, we need to use \"true\"^^xsd:boolean.\n\nBut I should check the ontology's data properties. The availableForPlacement is a data property with range xsd:boolean, so that's correct.\n\nThis covers the three main conditions. The other parts like the registration method can't be modeled because they are either discretionary (like how they registered) or inferred through the employment status.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL code should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement: Must have employment status 'RegisteredUnemployed'\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n        sh:message \"Employment status must be registered unemployed.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement: Must be available for placement efforts\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must be available for employment agency placement.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement: 12 months of compulsory insurance within 30 months before registration\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"Must have 12 months of compulsory insurance within last 30 months.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

Translate it from German to English and structure the relevant information:\n    - Benefit name (German and English)\n    - IDLB identifier\n    - Eligibility requirements (in English)\n\nBenefit (DE / EN): Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung (DE) / Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments (EN)\nIDLB: B100019_LB_102717659\nRequirements text (EN): * You have a severe visual or hearing impairment or are at risk of such a disability.\n* Your responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency.\n* Your prospects of participating in working life or participating in working life again are significantly reduced not only temporarily due to the nature and severity of your disability and you therefore need help to participate in working life.\n* You are willing to undergo vocational training or be integrated into the labor market in some other way.\n\nStep 2 - Break down the requirements text into individual eligibility requirements. Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. User has a disability OR is at risk of a disability (GREEN).\n2. The disability is a visual OR hearing impairment (GREEN).\n3. The disability is severe (YELLOW: Meaning of severe in a legal sense must be explained or inferred).\n4. User's rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (GREEN).\n5. The disability reduces the user's prospect of participating in working life permanently (GREEN) AND significantly (RED: Likely discretionary)\n6. Because of their disability, the user needs support with their integration into the workforce (GREEN).\n7. User is willing to participate in vocational training OR be integrated into the workforce in some other way (RED: User's willingness may depend on their eligibility).\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph based on the given social benefit description. The task is to validate if a user (targeting the node ff:User) meets the eligibility criteria. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the benefit is \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\" with IDLB B100019_LB_102717659. The conditions listed are:\n\n1. The user has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of such a disability.\n2. Their rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency.\n3. Their prospects of participating in working life are significantly and permanently reduced due to the disability's nature and severity, requiring support.\n4. The user is willing to undergo vocational training or similar integration.\n\nNow, I need to translate these into SHACL constraints using the provided ontology. Let me break down each requirement.\n\nStarting with the first condition: having a severe visual/hearing impairment or being at risk. The ontology has ff:hasDisabilityType and ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType. The disabilities are subclasses of ff:Disability, specifically ff:VisualImpairment and ff:HearingImpairment. Also, the disability must be severe (ff:severeDisability true) and reduce work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true). The \"at risk\" part might use ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType, but I need to check if that's applicable here.\n\nSecond, the rehabilitation provider must be the FederalEmploymentAgency. So ff:hasRehabilitationProvider should point to that individual.\n\nThird, the disability must meet the criteria of severity and permanence. The user needs help because of the disability (workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to the disability). \n\nFourth condition about willingness might be tricky. Since willingness is a subjective state, maybe it's excluded as per the rules (can't be assessed by data). The example solution excluded willingness, so I'll follow that.\n\nNow, structuring SHACL shapes. The main shape targets ff:User. Use sh:or for the disability or atRisk. The DisabilityShape must ensure the type is Visual or Hearing, and has severeDisability true. Also, the reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must be true. Additionally, the disability must be the cause of needing workforce integration (via inverse path on workforceIntegrationProblemBecause).\n\nCheck if all required properties are in the ontology. For example, ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause is an object property pointing from Person to Disability, so the inverse would link Disability to the user. So in the DisabilityShape, ensuring that the disability is referenced via that property from the user.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape will have the OR condition for disability types, the provider check, and the constraints on the disability's properties. The example's solution structure is similar, so I'll follow that pattern.\n\nWait, the first condition also mentions \"at risk of such a disability\" – so using ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType. The example used that as an OR condition, so that's correct. Also, the DisabilityShape applies to both hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType targets?\n\nHmm, perhaps the DisabilityShape should be applied via qualifiedValueShapes for both paths. Each path (hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType) must have their targets (the disabilities) meet the shape's constraints.\n\nAdditionally, the third point requires that the disability's severity and impact are such that the user needs help. The \"brauchen deshalb Hilfen\" part might be captured by the existence of the workforceIntegrationProblemBecause link from the user to the disability. So the DisabilityShape must have a constraint that the user is linked via that property to the disability.\n\nI need to structure the SHACL constraints step by step, ensuring all parts are covered without including ambiguous requirements.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102717659 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\"@de, \"Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPES\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102717659 ;\n\n    # Requirement 1: Disability or at-risk status\n    sh:or (\n        [\n            sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape\n        ]\n    ) ;\n\n    # Requirement 2: Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency\"@en\n    ] .\n\n# DISABILITY CONSTRAINTS\nff:DisabilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Must be visual or hearing impairment\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ;\n        sh:message \"Must be visual or hearing impairment\"@en\n    ] ;\n\n    # Must be severe\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Disability must be severe\"@en\n    ] ;\n\n    # Must reduce work prospects permanently\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Work prospects must be permanently reduced\"@en\n    ] ;\n\n    # Must be cause of workforce integration need\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n        sh:message \"Disability must necessitate workforce integration support\"@en\n    ] .\n```"

Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. An insolvency event occurred:\n\t- Insolvency proceedings are opened against the employer's assets (GREEN) OR\n\t- An insolvency application is rejected for lack of assets (GREEN) OR\n\t- Business activity is completely discontinued AND there is an obvious lack of assets (GREEN)\n2. User wage was cut within 3 months before the insolvency event (GREEN)\n3. User is \n  - employed in Germany (GREEN) OR \n  - employed abroad AND subject to social security in Germany (GREEN) (Note: the temporary nature of the posting can be presumed if employment abroad plus social security in Germany, see [1])\n4. User is an employee (GREEN)\n5. If the user is, for example, a managing partner, shareholder of a limited liability company or a relative of the employer, they must prove that they are an employee with a notice from the clearing office (RED: \"for example\" - rule under defined)\n\n[1] SGB 4 §4: https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_4/__4.html\n\nStep 3 - Generate the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the Insolvenzgeld (Insolvency Allowance) based on the provided description. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the social benefit is B100019_LB_576848, which is the Insolvenzgeld. The eligibility conditions are:\n\n1. An insolvency event must occur at the user's employer. This can be one of three scenarios:\n   a. Insolvency proceedings opened against the employer's assets.\n   b. Insolvency application rejected due to lack of assets.\n   c. Business operations discontinued completely due to obvious lack of assets.\n\n2. The user's wages were not paid for up to 3 months before the insolvency event.\n\n3. The user must be employed either in Germany or temporarily abroad while maintaining social security in Germany.\n\n4. The user must be legally recognized as an employee. If they are a managing partner, shareholder of a GmbH, or relative of the employer, they need a clearance notice from the German Pension Insurance Clearing Office.\n\nThe example solution shows how similar requirements were structured using SHACL. I need to follow that structure but ensure I use the correct ontology terms and model only the conditions that can be assessed unambiguously.\n\nStarting with the first requirement: the insolvency event. The example used shapes for each scenario (A, B, C). Each scenario must check the employer's event type and related properties. For scenario C, the business discontinuation must have an obvious lack of assets.\n\nSecond requirement: the wage cut must be within 3 months before the event. The wageCutOffsetMonths data property is used here. The example used a PropertyShape to enforce that the value is between -3 and -1 (since it's before the event).\n\nThird condition: employment in Germany or abroad with social security in Germany. This requires checking countryOfEmployment and socialSecurityCountry. The example used two NodeShapes for OR condition.\n\nFourth condition: employment status must be Employee. The example included a property shape requiring hasEmploymentStatus to be in (ff:Employee).\n\nThe part about proving employee status via a notice from the clearing office is tricky. The user must have a certain status, but the ontology doesn't mention a property for this notice. Since the requirement mentions this is needed for certain cases, but it's not a direct data property the user can provide, this might be a red condition (discretion of third parties), so we exclude it.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for relevant properties:\n\n- ff:hasEmploymentStatus for employment status (Employee)\n- ff:countryOfEmployment for employer's country\n- ff:socialSecurityCountry for social security country\n- ff:hasEvent to link to employer's events (InsolvencyProceeding, etc.)\n- ff:wageCutOffsetMonths for the wage cut timing\n- ff:obviousLackOfAssets on the employer for scenario C\n\nThe InsolvencyEvent scenarios need to be linked to the user's employer via ff:hasEmployment -> ff:employer. Then, the employer must have an event of the required type.\n\nWait, in the example, they used (ff:hasEmployment ff:employer) as the path for the property shape. Then, within each InsolvencyEventShape (A, B, C), they check the employer's event. So, each of those shapes would require the employer to have an event of the correct class (e.g., InsolvencyProceeding), and the necessary properties (like isOpen for proceeding being open).\n\nFor scenario C, the DiscontinuationOfBusiness must have obviousLackOfAssets. However, the obviousLackOfAssets is a data property on ff:Employer. So the path would be ff:hasEmployment -> ff:employer -> ff:obviousLackOfAssets.\n\nWait, looking at the ontology:\n\nDataProperty: ff:obviousLackOfAssets\n    Domain: ff:Employer\n    Range: xsd:boolean \n\nSo the property is on the employer. So for scenario C, the employer must have ff:obviousLackOfAssets set to true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main shape (InsolvenzgeldShape) targets ff:User and includes:\n\n- A property shape checking the employer's event (using sh:or with the three scenarios)\n- The wage cut shape (WageCutShape)\n- The country conditions (CountryShapeA or B)\n- Employment status as Employee.\n\nEach scenario (A, B, C) under sh:or must ensure the employer has the correct event and its properties. For example, InsolvencyEventShapeA requires the employer's event is InsolvencyProceeding and it's open (isOpen true).\n\nThe wageCutOffsetMonths is a data property on the event (ff:Event), so the path would be (ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths). Wait, no, the user's event? Or the employer's event?\n\nWait, the wage cut is tied to the event that caused the insolvency. The user's employment's employer's event would be the one causing the wage cut. The event's wageCutOffsetMonths should be the timing relative to the event.\n\nHmm, maybe the wage cut is part of the employer's event. Let me re-express:\n\nThe wageCutOffsetMonths is a property of the event (ff:Event), which is part of the employer's events. The user's employer has an event (the insolvency event), and that event has a wageCutOffsetMonths. So the path would be:\n\n(ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths)\n\nBut the WageCutShape in the example used:\n\nsh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths )\n\nWait, in the example's WageCutShape, the path is (ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths). But the user's hasEvent might not be the correct path here. The employer's hasEvent would be the correct one.\n\nWait, the example's solution might have a mistake, but I need to follow the ontology. Let me check the ontology again:\n\nObjectProperty: ff:hasEvent\n    Domain: ff:Employer, ff:Person\n    Range: ff:Event \n\nSo, the employer can have an event via ff:hasEvent. The user's employment has an employer, so the path from the user to the event would be:\n\nuser -> ff:hasEmployment -> ff:employer -> ff:hasEvent\n\nTherefore, the path for the wageCutOffsetMonths would be:\n\n(ff:hasEmployment / ff:employer / ff:hasEvent / ff:wageCutOffsetMonths )\n\nBut in SHACL path notation, that would be:\n\n(ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths )\n\nSimilarly, the event's class must be one of the three types (InsolvencyProceeding, etc.), so in each InsolvencyEventShape, we need to check that the employer's hasEvent is an instance of the correct class.\n\nWait, for example, in InsolvencyEventShapeA:\n\nThe event must be an InsolvencyProceeding. So in the property shape:\n\nsh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding \n\nSo putting it together:\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA has a property that requires:\n\n- The path (ff:hasEmployment / ff:employer / ff:hasEvent) must have an instance of ff:InsolvencyProceeding (sh:class)\n\n- The event must have ff:isOpen = true (since InsolvencyProceeding's isOpen must be true? Or is the proceeding still open?)\n\nWait the example's InsolvencyEventShapeA had:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen )\n    sh:minCount 1\n    sh:in (true)\n]\n\nBut in the example, the path for the employer's event might be different. Maybe the example's approach was to have the user's employer's event as part of their employment's employer's hasEvent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example considered that the user's hasEvent is the event in question, but that might not align with ontology. Need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event is part of the user's own hasEvent, but according to the ontology, the user's hasEvent is allowed (since the domain includes Person). But the description says the event is at the employer's side. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait the problem is that the insolvency event is about the employer, so the employer's hasEvent is the correct path. The user's hasEmployment links to their employer, and the employer has the event.\n\nThus, in the property shape for the employer's event, the path is (ff:hasEmployment / ff:employer / ff:hasEvent), and then check the class and properties of that event.\n\nTherefore, in the example's approach, perhaps they simplified it by assuming the user's hasEvent is the employer's event. But according to the ontology, that's not the case. So I need to adjust paths accordingly.\n\nThis might mean that the example's solution might have a mistake, but I need to follow ontology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's event is linked via another property. Let me check the ontology again:\n\nLooking at ff:triggeringEvent:\n\nObjectProperty: ff:triggeringEvent\n    Domain: ff:EarningCapacity, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation\n    Range: ff:Event \n\nHmm, maybe not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the insolvency event is an event that the user has, linked via ff:hasEvent, but the ontology allows that. Let me see:\n\nThe ff:hasEvent has domain Employer and Person, so a user (Person) can have an event. So maybe the insolvency event is an event that the user has, which is related to their employer's insolvency. But that might require more complex modeling.\n\nAlternatively, the example might have modeled it as the user's employer's event, but via the path (ff:hasEmployment / ff:employer / ff:hasEvent).\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the example's approach was to model it via the user's hasEvent, but that might not be accurate. To proceed correctly, perhaps I need to use the correct paths as per the ontology.\n\nThis could get complicated, but let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape (InsolvenzgeldShape) targets ff:User and has a property shape for the employer's event (the insolvency event):\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ) ;  // Get the employer of the user's employment\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  // Must have at least one employer\n    sh:or ( ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA ff:InsolvencyEventShapeB ff:InsolvencyEventShapeC ) ; // OR one of the three scenarios\n    sh:message \"...\" .\n]\n\nEach InsolvencyEventShape (A/B/C) is a NodeShape that must be applied to the employer node.\n\nFor example, ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA (insolvency proceedings opened):\n\nThis shape would require:\n\n- The employer has an event that is an instance of InsolvencyProceeding.\n\n- That event has ff:isOpen = true.\n\n- The wageCutOffsetMonths for that event is between -3 and -1.\n\nWait, but the wageCutOffsetMonths is on the event. So the path would be:\n\n(ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths )\n\nBut the employer's event is linked via ff:hasEvent, so:\n\nWithin the InsolvencyEventShapeA (applied to the employer node), the properties would be:\n\n- hasEvent must be of class InsolvencyProceeding\n\n- hasEvent has ff:isOpen = true\n\n- hasEvent's wageCutOffsetMonths is between -3 and -1.\n\nSo the WageCutShape might need to be part of each InsolvencyEventShape, but perhaps the example factored it out as a shared shape.\n\nAlternatively, the WageCutShape is a PropertyShape that applies to the path from the employer's event.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure each shape properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the WageCutShape is part of the employer's node shape, checking their event's wageCutOffsetMonths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the WageCutShape is a separate PropertyShape that's included in each InsolvencyEventShape.\n\nAlternatively, the example's approach was to have the WageCutShape as a shared shape that enforces the wage cut timing, which is part of the employer's event.\n\nHmm, this is getting too time-consuming. Let me try to proceed with the example's approach but adjust for the ontology.\n\nIn the example's solution:\n\nThe InsolvencyEventShapeA has a property ff:WageCutShape, which enforces the wageCutOffsetMonths.\n\nWait, the example's WageCutShape is a PropertyShape with sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ). But if the path is from the employer's node, that would be ( ff:hasEvent ... ), but the WageCutShape is applied in the context of the employer's node (since the InsolvencyEventShape is a NodeShape for the employer).\n\nAlternatively, the example's WageCutShape's path is relative to the current node (the employer), so:\n\nff:WageCutShape a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ;\n    sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n    sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n    ... .\n\nBut in SHACL, the path is relative to the current node (the employer in this case), so this would check that the employer's hasEvent has a wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and -1.\n\nBut the employer can have multiple events, so perhaps it's required that at least one of their events meets this.\n\nAlternatively, the wage cut must be part of the same event that is the insolvency event.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Given time constraints, I'll proceed following the example's structure but ensure the ontology terms are correctly used.\n\nAnother point: The third condition says the user is employed in Germany OR temporarily abroad with social security in Germany. The countryOfEmployment is on the employment, so:\n\n- ff:hasEmployment / ff:countryOfEmployment must be Germany (CountryShapeA)\n\nOR\n\n- ff:hasEmployment / ff:countryOfEmployment is not Germany, AND ff:socialSecurityCountry is Germany (CountryShapeB)\n\nThe socialSecurityCountry is a data property on the user, so path ff:socialSecurityCountry.\n\nThe example's CountryShapeB correctly checks countryOfEmployment not Germany and socialSecurityCountry Germany.\n\nLastly, the employment status must be Employee (ff:Employee).\n\nThe proof requirement (clearing office notice) is red because it depends on third parties, so exclude it.\n\nNow, writing the SHACL:\n\nStart with the benefit definition:\n\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\nThen the main shape:\n\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ) ;  // Employer node\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or ( ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA ff:InsolvencyEventShapeB ff:InsolvencyEventShapeC ) ;\n        sh:message \"... insolvency event at employer ...\" .\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        ff:CountryShapeA\n        ff:CountryShapeB\n    ) ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Employee ) ;\n        sh:message \"... employee status ...\" .\n    ] ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape . // Wait, but WageCutShape is part of the employer's conditions?\n\nWait, no. The wage cut timing is part of the employer's event conditions, so perhaps the WageCutShape is part of the InsolvencyEventShape's constraints.\n\nLooking back to the example's solution:\n\nIn their solution, the WageCutShape was a PropertyShape applied via the employer's property shape. The main shape had:\n\nsh:property [\n    ... \n    sh:or ( ...)\n    sh:message ...\n] ; // This includes the wage cut via the shapes in the or\n\nAlternatively, the WageCutShape is a separate property, but perhaps it's better to include it in each InsolvencyEventShape.\n\nWait in the example's InsolvencyEventShapeA, they have sh:property ff:WageCutShape. So:\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [ ... for class and isOpen ... ] .\n\nThus, each InsolvencyEventShape includes the WageCutShape to enforce the wage cut timing.\n\nTherefore, the WageCutShape is a shared PropertyShape that applies to the path from the employer (since it's part of their NodeShape).\n\nSo the WageCutShape's path is ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ), but since the node is the employer, the path becomes employer's hasEvent's wageCutOffsetMonths.\n\nTherefore, the WageCutShape is:\n\nff:WageCutShape a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ; // Employer hasEvent's wageCutOffsetMonths\n    sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n    sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n    sh:message \"... wage cut within 3 months ...\" .\n\nWait, but the path is from the employer's node. So the property shape is applied to the employer node, and the path is ff:hasEvent/ff:wageCutOffsetMonths. However, this would require that the employer has an event with that property. But in SHACL, the path will collect all such values from the employer's events. To ensure at least one event meets the criteria, the minCount would be 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the wage cut is part of the specific event (the insolvency event), so perhaps the WageCutShape is part of the InsolvencyEventShape's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the WageCutShape is a PropertyShape that is part of each InsolvencyEventShape's constraints, ensuring that the event's wageCutOffsetMonths is within the range.\n\nThis is getting quite complex, but following the example's structure, I'll proceed similarly.\n\nNow, putting all together in Turtle:\n\nThe main shape has the employer's property with the three or conditions (A/B/C), which each include the WageCutShape and their own conditions.\n\nEach InsolvencyEventShape:\n\nShapeA (insolvency proceeding opened):\n\n- Must have an event that is InsolvencyProceeding (sh:class)\n- That event must have ff:isOpen = true (since proceedings are open?)\n- WageCutShape is applied to enforce the wage cut timing.\n\nWait, in the example's solution for InsolvencyEventShapeA, they have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n]\n\nand another property for ff:isOpen.\n\nSo in code:\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\nWait but the ff:isOpen is a property of the InsolvencyProceeding (which is a sublcass of Event). So the path is ff:hasEvent's isOpen.\n\nAlternatively, the path for the second property is ( ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen ), and the sh:in (true) requires that at least one such value is true.\n\nBut this would require that the employer has an InsolvencyProceeding event which is open, and that the wage cut is within 3 months.\n\nSimilarly for ShapeB (insolvency application rejected):\n\nsh:InsolvencyEventShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\nShapeC (business discontinued with obvious lack of assets):\n\nsh:InsolvencyEventShapeC a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ff:obviousLackOfAssets ) ; // Wait, the obviousLackOfAssets is on the employer\n        // Or wait, the obviousLackOfAssets is a data property of Employer, so path is ff:obviousLackOfAssets\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, the obviousLackOfAssets is a data property on the employer (domain ff:Employer). So for the employer node (the target of the InsolvencyEventShapeC), the path is just ff:obviousLackOfAssets.\n\nTherefore:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in (true) ;\n] .\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe WageCutShape is a PropertyShape for the path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ), but since this is applied to the employer's node, it's checking that the employer has an event with wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and -1.\n\nWait, but the wageCutOffsetMonths is on the event, so the path from the employer would be ff:hasEvent/ff:wageCutOffsetMonths.\n\nSo the WageCutShape:\n\nff:WageCutShape a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ;\n    sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n    sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n    sh:message \"Wage cut must be within 3 months before the event.\"@en .\n\nThis ensures that at least one of the employer's events has wageCutOffsetMonths in that range.\n\nHowever, this might require that the event in question (the insolvency event) is the one with the wage cut. To ensure that the wage cut is part of the insolvency event, perhaps the WageCutShape should be part of the InsolvencyEventShape's constraints, ensuring that the specific event (e.g., the InsolvencyProceeding) has that property.\n\nAlternatively, the current approach might be sufficient if the insolvency event is the one causing the wage cut.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the example's approach, I'll proceed with the structure similar to the example, adjusting paths as per ontology.\n\nFinal Turtle code would look like the example but with correct ontology paths and terms.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Benefit definition\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\n# Main shape for Insolvenzgeld\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Insolvency event at employer\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ) ; # Employer node\n        sh:minCount 1 ; # Must have an employer\n        sh:or ( \n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA \n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeB \n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeC \n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"No valid insolvency event at employer detected.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 3: Employment location condition (Germany or abroad with German social security)\n    sh:or (\n        ff:CountryShapeA \n        ff:CountryShapeB \n    ) ;\n    \n    # Requirement 4: Employment status must be Employee\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Employee ) ;\n        sh:message \"User must be legally recognized as an employee.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# Insolvency event scenarios\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Insolvency proceedings opened\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ; # Wage cut within 3 months\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ; # Employer's event\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; # Must be this type\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen ) ; \n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( true ) ; # Proceedings must be open\n    ] .\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Insolvency application rejected for lack of assets\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( true ) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeC a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Business discontinued due to obvious lack of assets\n    sh:property ff:WageCutShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; # Direct employer property\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( true ) ;\n    ] .\n\n# Requirement 2: Wage cut within 3 months before event\nff:WageCutShape a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ; # Employer's event wage cut offset\n    sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n    sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n    sh:message \"Wage cut must have occurred within 3 months before the insolvency event.\"@en .\n\n# Requirement 3 components\nff:CountryShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Germany ) ;\n    ] .\n\nff:CountryShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:not [ sh:in ( ff:Germany ) ] ; # Not in Germany\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ; # User's social security country\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Germany ) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit \"Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung\" (L100040_LB_8664880). Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nFirst, the benefit is available to needy persons who cannot cover their necessary living expenses from income and assets and meet one of the three conditions:\n\n1. They have reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII (ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true).\n2. They are over 18 and permanently fully work-impaired (ff:hasDisabilityType with a Disability that reduces work prospects permanently).\n3. They are over 18 and either in the entry procedure and vocational training area at a workshop for disabled people or in a vocational training relationship where they receive a training budget.\n\nAlso, social assistance is a secondary benefit. Applicants must pursue claims against third parties (like maintenance claims) first. If those aren't fulfilled, then social assistance can step in, but this involves claims transferring to the authorities.\n\nNow, I need to model these in SHACL. The target is the ff:User node. Let's break down each condition.\n\nFirst, the main eligibility criteria:\n\n- The user must have insufficient income/assets (ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false). Wait, the text says they can't cover their basic needs. The ontology has ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds as a data property. So, the user must have this property as false.\n\nNext, the three conditions are ORed. So the user must meet at least one of the three conditions.\n\nCondition 1: aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true. So, the user must have ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit = true.\n\nCondition 2: The user is over 18 (hasAge >= 18), and has a disability that reduces work prospects permanently. The disability must have ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true. So the user must have a Disability (via ff:hasDisabilityType) which has that property.\n\nCondition 3: The user is over 18 (hasAge >=18) and is either in the entry procedure (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) or in a vocational training with a training budget. The ontology has EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea as a subclass of Training. So the user must have a Training of that type, or has an EmploymentStatus that is in an vocational training with TrainingBudget?\n\nWait, looking at the ontology, the third condition mentions \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\" So the user is in a vocational training relationship (maybe via ff:hasEmploymentStatus or ff:participates in a Training that has a TrainingBudget). \n\nLooking at the ontology, there is an individual TrainingBudget which is a SocialBenefit. Maybe the user has to have a Training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency? Or perhaps the user participates in a Training that has ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract and maybe ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true? Alternatively, maybe the user has a Training instance that is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining, and the Training has ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract, and has a TrainingBudget.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement states that the training is part of the entry procedure and vocational training area, so the Training must be of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining with some relation to the budget.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user must participate in a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or have a Training where they receive a TrainingBudget. Since TrainingBudget is a SocialBenefit, maybe the user receives it? Or maybe the Training is linked to the TrainingBudget via some property. The ontology has ff:TrainingBudget as an individual of SocialBenefit. Maybe the user's training has a property like ff:hasFunding from TrainingBudget? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user is participating in a Training that is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has the TrainingBudget as a funding source. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for that, maybe I can use ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract and maybe ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true? Or perhaps the Training has a ff:triggeringEvent or some other relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third condition is split into two parts: either they are in the entry procedure (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) or in a vocational training with a TrainingBudget. So the user must either have a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or have a Training instance that is part of a vocational training and has a TrainingBudget. Since TrainingBudget is a SocialBenefit, maybe the user has a ff:receivedBenefit (past tense?) but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the user must participate in a Training that is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, so ff:participates in a Training that is an instance of that class. For the second part of condition 3 (in a vocational training with a training budget), perhaps the Training has a ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract (which is a subclass of Contract), and the Training is commissioned by the Employment Agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true). Or maybe the Training has a ff:hasResidencePermit or something else. Hmm, maybe I need to look at the ontology again.\n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\nThere's ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which is a subclass of Training. So for the first part of condition 3, the user must have a Training of that type via ff:participates.\n\nFor the second part of condition 3 (in a vocational training with a training budget), maybe the Training must be a VocationalTraining (subclass of Training) and have ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true (since the training budget is provided by the Employment Agency?), or have some property indicating they receive the TrainingBudget. Since TrainingBudget is a SocialBenefit, perhaps the user is receiving that benefit for the training. Not sure, but maybe the commission is a better approach. The ontology has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency as a data property for Training. So if the Training is commissioned by the agency, that might imply the budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third condition is covered by the user being in a Training of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining, and the Training is commissioned by the Employment Agency (commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true). \n\nSo putting it together for condition 3:\n\nThe user must have either:\n\n- participates in a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, OR\n- participates in a VocationalTraining (or another type) where ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Training has ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract and commissioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third condition's second part is that they are in a vocational training where they receive the TrainingBudget. Since TrainingBudget is a SocialBenefit, perhaps the user has ff:receivesBenefit TrainingBudget. But the benefit in question is the SocialAssistance (Grundsicherung), so maybe that's part of the application process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a Training instance where the Training has ff:triggeringEvent leading to the need for the benefit, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third condition is simply that the user is participating in a VocationalTraining or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, and that's it. Since the exact relation to TrainingBudget isn't in the ontology's data properties, perhaps I can model the participation in those specific Training types.\n\nAssuming that:\n\nFor condition 3:\n\nThe user must have ff:participates in a Training that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining with some other conditions (like being commissioned). But maybe for SHACL, it's sufficient to have participates in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or VocationalTraining with commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third condition is split into two parts:\n\n- Either the user is participating in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or\n\n- They are in a VocationalTraining (or another type) where the Training is commissioned by the Employment Agency (commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true).\n\nSo, for condition 3, the user must have either:\n\n- participates in a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea,\n\nOR\n\n- participates in a Training where ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vocational training part is covered by ff:participates in VocationalTraining and commissioned.\n\nSo, to model the three conditions in SHACL:\n\nThe user must satisfy at least one of the three conditions (1, 2, or 3).\n\nEach condition is an OR, so in SHACL, we can use sh:or.\n\nThe overall shape would require:\n\n- canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false,\n\nAND\n\n( (condition1) OR (condition2) OR (condition3) )\n\nNow, let's structure each condition:\n\nCondition1: ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true.\n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\nCondition2: hasAge >= 18 AND has a Disability that reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true.\n\nThe user must have ff:hasDisabilityType linked to a Disability (individual) which has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nAdditionally, the user's age must be >=18.\n\nSo for age:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n]\n\nThen, the Disability part:\n\nThe user must have at least one Disability (via ff:hasDisabilityType) that has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nThis is a path that goes through hasDisabilityType to a Disability node which has that property.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be modeled with a property path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType/xsd:boolean(ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently) ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n]\n\nWait, but in SHACL, to express that there exists an object connected via ff:hasDisabilityType where the Disability has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true, perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasDisabilityType ] ;  // Wait, maybe better to use the path as ff:hasDisabilityType\n    sh:node [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with sh:hasValue and a path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:sparql \"\"\"\n        ASK WHERE {\n            ?this ff:hasDisabilityType ?disability .\n            ?disability ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true .\n        }\n    \"\"\" ;\n]\n\nBut since we need to use only SHACL Core, SPARQL is not allowed. So perhaps using nested node shapes.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:sparql is part of SHACL-SPARQL, but the user specified to use only SHACL Core components. Therefore, we have to find a way with Core.\n\nHmm, this might be challenging. Maybe the Disability must be linked via hasDisabilityType, and the Disability must have reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as true. To express that in SHACL Core, perhaps the following:\n\nThe user must have a hasDisabilityType that points to a node (disability) with ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ?DisabilityNode ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValuesConstraint [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, maybe using sh:qualifiedValueShapes and sh:qualifiedMinCount:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValues [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nYes, that's the way. So this would require that at least one of the ff:hasDisabilityType objects has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as true.\n\nSo condition2 requires:\n\n- hasAge >=18\n\nAND\n\n- hasDisabilityType with that property.\n\nSo in SHACL, condition2 is a shape that combines both.\n\nSimilarly for condition3.\n\nCondition3: age >=18 AND ( participates in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea OR participates in a Training with commissionedByEmploymentAgency true )\n\nSo:\n\nThe user must have hasAge >=18.\n\nAND ( either participates in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, OR participates in a Training where commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true )\n\nSo, for the participation:\n\nThe user has a participates link to a Training instance that is either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true.\n\nThis can be modeled with sh:or:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] \n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] ]\n    )\n]\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe main shape for the benefit will have:\n\nsh:property for canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds being false.\n\nThen, an sh:or between the three conditions (1, 2, 3).\n\nEach condition is a nested node shape.\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the structure is:\n\nThe overall shape has a property that requires one of the three conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the overall shape can have an sh:or of three node shapes, each representing the condition.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested structure.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL shape for the benefit can have a sh:and constraint with the basic requirement and an sh:or between the three conditions.\n\nLet me outline the structure step by step.\n\nFirst, the benefit node is defined as ff:L100040_LB_8664880.\n\nThe main shape would target ff:User and validate the conditions.\n\nThe main requirements are:\n\n- canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false.\n\nAND\n\n( (condition1) OR (condition2) OR (condition3) )\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nff:Grundsicherung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ; sh:hasValue true ; ] ]  // Condition1\n        [ sh:property [ \n            sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ; \n            sh:property [ \n                sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n                sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n                sh:qualifiedValues [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                        sh:hasValue true ;\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n        ] ]  // Condition2\n        [ sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n          sh:or (\n              [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] ]\n              [ sh:property [ \n                  sh:path ff:participates ;\n                  sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ; sh:hasValue true ]\n              ] ]\n          )\n        ]\n    )\n;\n\nWait, but the structure might be more complex. Let me think again.\n\nFor condition2:\n\nThe shape must have:\n\n- hasAge >=18\n\nAND\n\n- has at least one Disability linked via hasDisabilityType with reducesWorkProspectsPermanently = true.\n\nSo the condition2 shape must require both the age and the disability condition.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with a node shape that includes both constraints.\n\nSimilarly for condition3:\n\nThe shape must have age >=18, and either participates in EntryProcedure... or has participates with commissionedBy... true.\n\nTherefore, each condition is a node shape with their own constraints.\n\nThus, the sh:or in the main shape would have three elements:\n\nFirst element (condition1):\n\nA node shape that requires ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true.\n\nSecond element (condition2):\n\nA node shape that requires:\n\n- ff:hasAge >=18,\n\nAND\n\n- the hasDisabilityType qualified as above.\n\nThird element (condition3):\n\nA node shape that requires:\n\n- ff:hasAge >=18,\n\nAND\n\n- participates in either EntryProcedure... or a Training with commissionedBy... true.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe main sh:or has three components:\n\nEach is a node shape:\n\nCondition1 node:\n\nsh:NodeShape {\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ]\n}\n\nCondition2 node:\n\nsh:NodeShape {\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n}\n\nCondition3 node:\n\nsh:NodeShape {\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] \n            [ sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ]\n        )\n    ]\n}\n\nTherefore, the main shape will have these three node shapes in the sh:or list.\n\nPutting it all together in Turtle syntax.\n\nAlso, the SocialBenefit must be declared with its ID and labels.\n\nSo, the final SHACL will have:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:L100040_LB_8664880 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung\"@de, \"Social assistance for the elderly and those with reduced earning capacity\"@en .\n\nff:GrundsicherungsCheck a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n        sh:message \"Cannot cover personal basic needs\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or (\n        #

Decide for each requirement whether to include it in the SHACL graph by assigning it one of the following labels: \n    - GREEN: A layperson can easily assess if they meet the condition -> Include\n    - YELLOW: A layperson could likely assess if they meet the condition with some explanation -> Include\n    - RED: The requirement is ambiguous or is at the discretion of third parties and cannot be clearly assessed -> Exclude\n\n1. The user receives citizen benefit (GREEN).\n2. The user plans to\n    - take up new employment OR\n    - engage in self-employed activity AND the job center confirms the user's personal suitability AND the job center confirms the economic viability of the self-employed activity.\n  \n    (RED: the user's plans may depend on their eligibility; the job center's assessment is a discretionary third-party decision with unknown outcome)\n\n3. The user has not yet started the new employment or self-employed activity (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n4. The user will work at least 15 hours in the job (RED: depends on requirement 2).\n5.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements for the social benefit \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\" with IDLB B100019_LB_103817036. The user wants a SHACL graph to validate if someone is eligible based on the given conditions. \n\nStarting with the ontology provided, I need to map each requirement to the relevant classes, properties, and individuals. Let me go through each condition one by one and see which are assessable by SHACL without involving third-party decisions or ambiguities.\n\nFirst requirement: \"Sie und die von Ihnen begleitete Person mit Behinderung sind gesetzlich krankenversichert.\" \nThis translates to both the user and the person they're accompanying must have statutory health insurance. Looking at the ontology, there's a property ff:hasInsurance which can link to ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance. So, the user must have an insurance link to StatutoryHealthInsurance, and the accompanied person (who has a disability) must also have that. But how do I express that the accompanied person also has the insurance? The ontology has ff:caregiverInHousehold, but that's for CareNeed. Maybe the user has a relation via ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember to the person with disability. Wait, the requirement says \"begleitete Person mit Behinderung\", so perhaps the user is a caregiver for that person. The ontology has ff:needsCare which links a person to their CareNeed, and then the CareNeed has a caregiverInHousehold. So the user should be the caregiver for the person's CareNeed. But maybe simpler: the user must have the insurance, and the person with disability (linked via some property) must also have it. But how to represent that in SHACL? Maybe as two separate properties: the user's own insurance, and the accompanied person's insurance. However, SHACL can't traverse multiple hops easily. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a close relative who has the insurance. Hmm, tricky. Let's note this and see other requirements first.\n\nSecond requirement: \"Die zu begleitende Person wird stationär im Krankenhaus behandelt.\" \nStationary treatment implies a MedicalAccompaniment event? The ontology has ff:MedicalAccompaniment as a subclass of Event. The ff:fullDayAccompaniment data property says it's more than 8 hours including travel. Wait, the third point mentions the 8-hour requirement, so maybe the second point is about the person being inpatient. The ontology has ff:inPatientCoAdmission as a data property for MedicalAccompaniment. Wait, looking at DataProperty: ff:inPatientCoAdmission is \"True if a person is admitted as accompanying person for inpatient treatment\". So the user's MedicalAccompaniment event must have inPatientCoAdmission true. The accompanied person's treatment is stationary, so maybe the MedicalAccompaniment is linked to their CareNeed?\n\nThird requirement: \"Die stationäre Mitaufnahme als Begleitperson ist medizinisch notwendig. Gleichgestellt ist eine ganztägige Begleitung...\" \nMedically necessary, and the accompaniment must be at least 8 hours (fullDayAccompaniment is true). The ontology has ff:fullDayAccompaniment as a boolean on MedicalAccompaniment. So the user's MedicalAccompaniment event must have fullDayAccompaniment true.\n\nFourth: \"Sie haben einen Verdienstausfall.\" \nThis is \"income loss\", which might be linked to an event causing loss. The ontology has ff:causesLossOfEarnings as a data property on Event. So the user must have an event (maybe the MedicalAccompaniment event?) that has causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nFifth: \"Sie sind eine nahe angehörige Person oder Teil des engsten Umfelds.\" \nClose relative or part of immediate circle. The ontology has ff:closeRelative and ff:immediateCircleMember. The user must have either a closeRelative link to the person with disability, or be in their immediateCircleMember. But how to express OR in SHACL? Using sh:or. The user must have at least one of these relationships to the person they're accompanying. But again, need to model the relationship to the person with disability. Maybe the user has either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember pointing to the person with disability. However, in SHACL, how to represent that the target is the person needing care? Since SHACL is about validating the user's data, perhaps the user's node must have at least one of these properties pointing to the person with disability. But how to ensure that the person they point to has a disability?\n\nSixth: \"Die zu begleitende Person bezieht Leistungen der Eingliederungshilfe.\" \nThe accompanied person receives Integration Assistance (the benefit ff:IntegrationAssistance). So the person must have ff:receivesBenefit linked to ff:IntegrationAssistance. But again, the user's data must have a link to that person who in turn has that benefit. \n\nNow, considering SHACL constraints. Since SHACL can't traverse multiple hops (like user → person → hasBenefit), perhaps some conditions can't be captured. The problem says to exclude requirements that can't be assessed because they depend on third parties or are ambiguous. \n\nLooking at the sixth point, unless the user's data explicitly states that the accompanied person is receiving IntegrationAssistance, it can't be checked. Since SHACL can't verify that unless the user's graph includes that info, maybe this is a third-party condition and should be excluded. The same with the fifth point about the person with disability's benefit.\n\nLet me go through each requirement again, applying the color coding:\n\n1. Both user and accompanied person have statutory health insurance (GREEN? If user's own insurance is present, but the other's isn't directly accessible via ontology properties, maybe only the user's part is possible. Wait the user must have the insurance, and the accompanied person must also. But in the ontology, the user can have ff:hasInsurance to StatutoryHealthInsurance. However, the accompanied person's insurance isn't directly accessible unless linked via another property. Since the user's data may not include the other person's insurance info, this might be RED. Hmm, tricky. The requirement says \"Sie und die von Ihnen begleitete Person\" so both must have it. If the user's data doesn't include the other's insurance, this can't be validated. So maybe this is RED.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have the insurance, and the accompanied person's insurance is implied through another property. Not sure. Maybe the user's insurance is sufficient, but the other person's is required but can't be checked. So this might have to be excluded.\n\n2. Accompanied person is in stationary treatment. This relates to the MedicalAccompaniment event's inPatientCoAdmission being true. The user must be involved in such an event. So the user has an event (ff:MedicalAccompaniment) where ff:inPatientCoAdmission is true. But how to express that the user is part of that event? The ontology has ff:hasEvent for Person, so the user must have a MedicalAccompaniment event linked via ff:hasEvent, and that event has inPatientCoAdmission true.\n\n3. Accompaniment is medically necessary and full-day. The full-day is covered by fullDayAccompaniment, but \"medically necessary\" might be part of the event's definition. Since the event is MedicalAccompaniment, perhaps that's assumed. So the third point's main part is covered by the fullDayAccompaniment and inPatientCoAdmission.\n\n4. Income loss: The user must have an event (maybe the same MedicalAccompaniment) that causesLossOfEarnings. So the event has that property true.\n\n5. Close relative or immediate circle: The user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember link to the person they're accompanying. But the person they're accompanying must have a disability. The ontology has ff:hasDisability as a data property on Person. So the user's related person (via closeRelative or immediateCircle) must have ff:hasDisability true. But again, that requires multiple hops which SHACL can't handle. Unless the user explicitly states that the person has disability. Maybe the user has a relation to someone who has ff:hasDisability true. But in SHACL, this would need to be represented in the user's data as a property pointing to that person, and then that person's node has the disability. Since the user's data might not include the other person's details beyond the relationship, this might be ambiguous. So maybe this is RED.\n\n6. The accompanied person receives Integration Assistance: Again, requires checking another person's data which isn't directly available. So RED.\n\nSo the assessable requirements (GREEN/YELLOW) are:\n\n- User has statutory health insurance (ff:hasInsurance with value ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance)\n- The MedicalAccompaniment event (ff:hasEvent) must have inPatientCoAdmission true and fullDayAccompaniment true\n- The event causing income loss (ff:causesLossOfEarnings true)\n\nWait, but the income loss is via an event that the user has (triggering event?), perhaps linked via ff:triggeringEvent? Or maybe the MedicalAccompaniment event itself causes the loss. The user must have an event (maybe the same MedicalAccompaniment) that has causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nFirst, the shape must target ff:User. The shape will have constraints on these properties.\n\nFor the insurance:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n]\n\nFor the MedicalAccompaniment event:\n\nThe user must have an event of type MedicalAccompaniment, which has both inPatientCoAdmission and fullDayAccompaniment as true. \n\nThis can be done with a SHACL node shape that targets the MedicalAccompaniment instances linked via ff:hasEvent. But SHACL's sh:property can have a path with a filter. Alternatively, using sh:node and sh:property constraints within the path.\n\nAlternatively, for the MedicalAccompaniment event:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n    sh:or ( [\n        sh:hasValue [ a ff:MedicalAccompaniment ; ff:inPatientCoAdmission true ; ff:fullDayAccompaniment true ]\n    ] )\n    ]\nWait, maybe using sh:qualifiedMinCount and sh:qualifiedValuesConstraint:\n\nsh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\nsh:qualifiedValues [\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path a ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ]\n] \n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax here. Alternatively, each condition on the event's properties.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:node with a nested shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path a ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nThat might work. So the user must have at least one hasEvent pointing to a MedicalAccompaniment node with those two properties set to true.\n\nThen, the event must cause loss of earnings. The event (the MedicalAccompaniment) must have causesLossOfEarnings true. So within the same node shape for the MedicalAccompaniment, add that:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n]\n\nWait, but the causesLossOfEarnings is a data property on Event. So yes, the MedicalAccompaniment (which is an Event) must have that property.\n\nSo the MedicalAccompaniment's shape must include all three: inPatientCoAdmission, fullDayAccompaniment, and causesLossOfEarnings as true.\n\nPutting that together:\n\nThe main shape for the user will have a property for hasEvent, which must point to an instance that meets those criteria.\n\nAdditionally, the insurance check.\n\nNow, what about the close relative or immediate circle? Since we can't check the person's disability status via SHACL, maybe the requirement is just that the user is a close relative or in immediate circle, regardless of the other's disability? The requirement says \"nahe Verwandte oder Teil des engsten Umfelds\", so that's the user's relation to the accompanied person. But without knowing the target, maybe the user must have at least one closeRelative or immediateCircleMember link. But how to ensure that the target is the person needing care? Since we can't track that, perhaps the presence of either relation is sufficient for the condition. The requirement might just require that the user is in one of those categories relative to the person, but since we can't verify the exact target (unless the user's data has that), maybe it's better to exclude this as ambiguous.\n\nSo, excluding the fifth requirement as RED.\n\nThe sixth requirement is also RED.\n\nSo the final constraints are:\n\n1. User has statutory health insurance.\n2. User has a MedicalAccompaniment event (via hasEvent) that is inpatient, full-day, and causes income loss.\n\nNow, coding this in SHACL.\n\nThe benefit's ID is B100019_LB_103817036. The shape will target ff:User and validate these conditions.\n\nFirst, define the benefit:\n\nff:B100019_LB_103817036 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de,\n             \"Sickness benefit for caregiver during inpatient treatment of disabled person\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:KrankengeldBegleitperson a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [  # Health insurance check\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Must have statutory health insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [  # Medical Accompaniment event check\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:targetClass ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a qualifying MedicalAccompaniment event.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, when using sh:node with a NodeShape, it applies the constraints to each node in the path. So here, each node in ff:hasEvent must be a MedicalAccompaniment and have those properties. The sh:minCount 1 ensures at least one such event exists.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount to count only those events that meet the criteria.\n\nBut perhaps the above is acceptable.\n\nAdditionally, check if the user has the MedicalAccompaniment event with all required properties.\n\nI think this covers the assessable conditions. The other requirements involve relationships or third-party assessments which can't be validated via SHACL with the given ontology, so they are excluded.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_103817036 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\"@de ;\n    rdfs:label \"Sickness benefit for caregiver during inpatient treatment of disabled person\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:KrankengeldBegleitperson a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [  # Requirement: statutory health insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory health insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [  # Requirement: valid MedicalAccompaniment event\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [  # Shape for MedicalAccompaniment node\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:targetClass ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n            sh:property [  # Must be inpatient accompaniment\n                sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n                sh:message \"Accompaniment must be for inpatient treatment.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [  # Must meet full-day requirement\n                sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n                sh:message \"Accompaniment must last ≥8 hours including travel.\"@en ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [  # Must cause income loss\n                sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n                sh:message \"Event must cause income loss.\"@en ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a qualifying MedicalAccompaniment event.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"
