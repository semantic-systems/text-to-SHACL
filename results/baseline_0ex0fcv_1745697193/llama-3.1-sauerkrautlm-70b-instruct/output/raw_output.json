The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint

Mit Ihrer persönlichen Arbeitslosmeldung gilt das Arbeitslosengeld als beantragt. Zusätzlich muss noch ein Antragsformular ausgefüllt werden;\n  * Sie innerhalb der letzten 30 Monate vor der Arbeitslosmeldung (der sogenannten Rahmenfrist) mindestens 12 Monate versicherungspflichtig waren. \n    * Es werden auch Zeiten berücksichtigt, in denen Sie wegen des Bezuges von Entgeltersatzleistungen, wie zum Beispiel Krankengeld, oder - unter weiteren Voraussetzungen - zum Beispiel wegen der Pflege eines Angehörigen oder der Erziehung eines Kindes versicherungspflichtig zur Arbeitsförderung waren.\n    * Als Versicherungszeit können auch Zeiten berücksichtigt werden, in denen ein Antragspflichtversicherungsverhältnis (sogenannte freiwillige Weiterversicherung) vorlag, zum Beispiel  weil Sie eine selbständige Tätigkeit aufgenommen haben.\n    * In Sonderfällen werden auch Zeiten berücksichtigt, in denen Sie Entwicklungsdienst nach dem Entwicklungshelfergesetz geleistet haben oder Sie auf der Grundlage eines Sekundierungsvertrages im Ausland tätig waren.\n\nSHACL:\n",

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

It targets the 'ff:User' class, and it checks the following conditions:\n- The user receives one of the specified benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld and Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen).\n- The user's family gross income is below a certain threshold.\n- The user's age is 25 or below. However, for some benefits (Leistungen zur Teilhabe am sozialen und kulturellen Leben in der Gemeinschaft), the age limit is 18.\n\nNote that some constraints cannot be implemented directly from the text, as they are ambiguous or depend on external information (e.g., the exact income threshold). These have been left out or marked with comments."

        "rendered_prompt": "Your task is to generate a validation graph using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) based on the description of eligibility requirements for a social benefit. The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -
