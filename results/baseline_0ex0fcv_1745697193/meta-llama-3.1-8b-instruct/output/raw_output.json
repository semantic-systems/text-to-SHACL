The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

Sie sind also in der Lage und bereit, eine versicherungspflichtige Beschäftigung unter arbeitsmarktüblichen Bedingungen aufzunehmen;\n  * Sie sich \n    * elektronisch mit einem elektronischen Identitätsnachweis, zum Beispiel Personalausweis mit Online-Ausweisfunktion, im eServices-Portal der Bundesagentur für Arbeit oder\n    * persönlich bei der zuständigen Agentur für Arbeit arbeitslos gemeldet haben. Mit Ihrer persönlichen Arbeitslosmeldung gilt das Arbeitslosengeld als beantragt. Zusätzlich muss noch ein Antragsformular ausgefüllt werden;\n  * Sie innerhalb der letzten 30 Monate vor der Arbeitslosmeldung (der sogenannten Rahmenfrist) mindestens 12 Monate versicherungspflichtig waren. \n    * Es werden auch Zeiten berücksichtigt, in denen Sie wegen des Bezuges von Entgeltersatzleistungen, wie zum Beispiel Krankengeld, oder - unter weiteren Voraussetzungen - zum Beispiel wegen der Pflege eines Angehörigen oder der Erziehung eines Kindes versicherungspflichtig zur Arbeitsförderung waren.\n    * Als Versicherungszeit können auch Zeiten berücksichtigt werden, in denen ein Antragspflichtversicherungsverhältnis (sogenannte freiwillige Weiterversicherung) vorlag, zum Beispiel  weil Sie eine selbständige Tätigkeit aufgenommen haben.\n    * In Sonderfällen werden auch Zeiten berücksichtigt, in denen Sie Entwicklungsdienst nach dem Entwicklungshelfergesetz geleistet haben oder Sie auf der Grundlage eines Sekundierungsvertrages im Ausland tätig waren.\n\nSHACL:\n",

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -
