The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Einstiegsgeld' (B100019_LB_102713860) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text provided.\n\nFirst, the main conditions are:\n\n1. The user must have been receiving Bürgergeld (Citizen Benefit) before starting the new activity. Unemployment is not a requirement.\n2. The application must be submitted to the Jobcenter before starting the new activity.\n3. The new self-employment or employment must be suitable to overcome their need for assistance in the long term.\n4. The Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration into the general labor market.\n5. The new employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\n\nAdditionally, for self-employment or startup:\n\n- Positive evaluation by the Jobcenter regarding personal suitability and economic viability of the self-employment.\n\nNow, looking at the ontology to map these conditions to existing properties and classes.\n\nStarting with the main conditions:\n\n1. **Bürgergeld received before the new activity**: The user must have received \"Bürgergeld\" (B100019_LB_106311931) before starting the new job. The ontology has a property `ff:receivesBenefit` and `ff:receivedBenefit`. Since it's before starting the activity, maybe `receivedBenefit` would be appropriate. But also, perhaps the `ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver` could be used, but maybe better to check if the user has a history of receiving Bürgergeld. Wait, the condition says \"Sie erhalten vor Aufnahme Ihrer neuen Tätigkeit Bürgergeld\" which means they are currently receiving it before starting. So maybe `ff:receivesBenefit` with the Bürgergeld instance. But also, since the application is before the new activity, maybe there's a temporal consideration. Alternatively, maybe the user must have Bürgergeld as a current benefit before starting. So in SHACL, we can require that the user has a `ff:receivesBenefit` link to the Bürgergeld individual.\n\n2. **Application submitted before starting the activity**: The SHACL might need to ensure that the application is made before starting the employment. However, the ontology doesn't have a direct property for the application submission date. Since SHACL is for data validation, perhaps this is more about the employment start date being after the application. But since the data might not include application dates, maybe this condition can't be modeled directly. The problem says to ignore requirements that can't be assessed due to ambiguity or third party discretion. So perhaps this part is not modeled because it depends on the submission timing relative to the employment start, which might not be captured in the data. So maybe skip this.\n\n3. **New activity suitable to overcome need for assistance**: The ontology has properties related to eligibility and ineligibility. Maybe this is a subjective evaluation by the Jobcenter, so it's at the discretion of third parties. Hence, not modelable as per the rules. So skip this.\n\n4. **Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration**: Again, this seems like a subjective determination, so not modelable in SHACL based on existing data properties. Skip.\n\n5. **Employment must be at least 15 hours/week**: The ontology has `ff:workHoursPerWeek` on `ff:Employment`. The user's employment must have this property with a value >=15. So need to check that the user's employment (ff:hasEmployment) has workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nFor the additional conditions (self-employment/existenzgründung):\n\n- Positive evaluation by Jobcenter on personal suitability and economic viability. These are evaluations by a third party, so again, not modelable as per the rules. Hence, skip.\n\nNow, constructing the SHACL shapes.\n\nFirst, the target is always ff:User. The shape will be a SHACL node shape targeting ff:User.\n\nThe main requirements to model are:\n\n- The user must have a current receivesBenefit link to Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931).\n- The user's employment (ff:hasEmployment) must have workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nWait, but the employment is the new one, so maybe the user must have an employment (ff:hasEmployment) with workHoursPerWeek >=15. But the condition is that the new activity must have this, so perhaps the user's current employment must have that.\n\nBut also, since the user is starting this new activity, maybe the employment is part of their current data. The SHACL shape must ensure that the user has an employment where workHoursPerWeek is at least 15.\n\nAdditionally, for the Bürgergeld part, it's necessary that the user is currently receiving it (since \"vor Aufnahme\" implies before starting, so currently receiving). So `ff:receivesBenefit` to Bürgergeld.\n\nNow, in SHACL:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- A constraint that the user has a receivesBenefit link to B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld).\n- A constraint that the user has an employment (ff:hasEmployment) which has a workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nWait, but how do we model that the user's employment has that? The employment is an object linked via ff:hasEmployment. So the path would be ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek. But since the user must have at least one employment where this is true, we can use sh:minCount 1 on the path and sh:hasValue >=15.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with a path and sh:minInclusive.\n\nWait, the property would be:\n\nFor the Bürgergeld:\n\nA property shape on ff:receivesBenefit requiring that the value is exactly the Bürgergeld individual.\n\nWait, no, because they might receive other benefits, but this is a condition that they must be currently receiving Bürgergeld. So the user must have at least one ff:receivesBenefit link to Bürgergeld. So:\n\nsh:path ff:receivesBenefit\nsh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931\nsh:minCount 1\n\nSimilarly, for the employment's hours:\n\nsh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workHoursPerWeek ]\nsh:minInclusive 15\n\nWait, no. The path is from the user to employment via ff:hasEmployment, then employment has workHoursPerWeek. So the path should be:\n\nff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek\n\nBut since the user must have at least one employment where this is true, we can structure it as:\n\nA shape that the user must have an employment (ff:hasEmployment) and that employment must have workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAlternatively, using a nested shape:\n\nFirst, the employment must have workHoursPerWeek >=15. So:\n\nThe shape for the user would include:\n\nA property constraint on ff:hasEmployment with a node shape that requires:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal\n]\n\nWait, but in SHACL, when you have a path that is an object property leading to a node, you can apply a node shape to it. So:\n\nThe user's shape will have a property constraint on ff:hasEmployment, which must have a node shape where workHoursPerWeek is >=15.\n\nSo the SHACL would look like:\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the employment could be a new one, so maybe the user must have at least one employment (so the hasEmployment must exist and meet the condition). Alternatively, maybe the user must have an employment that meets the condition. The above approach ensures that any employment they have must meet the condition, but perhaps they can have multiple employments. However, the requirement is that the new activity (which would be their employment) must have >=15 hours. So the user must have at least one employment with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the employment is the new one, so the user must have at least one employment where workHoursPerWeek is >=15. The above setup ensures that.\n\nNow, are there any other constraints?\n\nThe first condition says \"Arbeitslosigkeit ist keine Voraussetzung\" (Unemployment is not a requirement). So the user doesn't have to be unemployed. But the SHACL should not check for unemployment. Since the requirement is that unemployment is not required, we don't need to include that as a constraint. So no need to model that.\n\nThe other conditions that can't be modeled are the application submission timing, the suitability evaluation, and the necessity for integration, which are subjective or not part of the data.\n\nSo the final SHACL should include the two constraints: receives Bürgergeld and employment with work hours >=15.\n\nWait, but the user might have multiple employments. The requirement is that the new activity must be at least 15 hours. So the employment in question must be the new one, but the SHACL can't track that. However, according to the data provided, the user's current employments would include the new one. So perhaps it's sufficient to ensure that at least one of their employments meets the 15 hours.\n\nThus, the SHACL constraints are as above.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for correct property names:\n\n- `ff:receivesBenefit` is correct for linking to the SocialBenefit instances.\n\n- `ff:workHoursPerWeek` is a data property on ff:Employment, correct.\n\n- The Bürgergeld is the individual ff:B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nThus, the SHACL should be written accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # User must currently receive Bürgergeld\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # User's employment must have at least 15 hours per week\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            ]\n        ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1\n    ] .\n```"

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' (which has the ID B100019_LB_102799525). The user provided the conditions in German, so first I'll need to understand those conditions thoroughly.\n\nThe first condition states: \"Sie müssen einen Anspruch auf Hinterbliebenenleistung aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung haben.\" This translates to \"You must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance.\" \n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant classes and properties might be related to Insurance, specifically StatutoryAccidentInsurance. The SocialBenefit in question is probably linked via some property. Since the user must have a claim, maybe they need to have this insurance. The ontology has ff:hasInsurance which links a Person to an Insurance. So the user (ff:User) must have an insurance of type StatutoryAccidentInsurance. But wait, the insurance itself might need to be of that type. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a claim on the benefit, which is linked through another property. Hmm, maybe the 'hasInsurance' would be the right property here. So the shape would require that the user has an insurance that is an instance of ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nThe second condition is: \"Sie haben wiedergeheiratet oder eine neue Lebenspartnerschaft nach dem Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz begründet.\" Translating to \"You have remarried or entered into a new civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act.\" \n\nThe ontology has ff:MaritalStatus with instances like Married, CivilUnion, etc. The key here is that the person must have a marital status indicating they are married or in a civil union again after being a widow. The 'newUnionAfterWidowhood' data property is part of the MaritalStatus class. So the user's marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. Wait, the property 'newUnionAfterWidowhood' is a data property of ff:MaritalStatus, so if the user's marital status is such that this property is true, that would satisfy the condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's marital status must be Married or CivilUnion, but only if they were previously widowed. But the condition says \"have remarried or new civil partnership after widowhood\". So the marital status must have that flag set. Let me check the ontology again. The DataProperty newUnionAfterWidowhood is on the MaritalStatus instance. So the user's marital status must be linked to a MaritalStatus instance where newUnionAfterWidowhood is true. \n\nNow, structuring this in SHACL. \n\nThe target node is always ff:User. \n\nFirst condition: The user must have an insurance of type ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nSo, using sh:property to check ff:hasInsurance, and the value should be a resource of type ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nSecond condition: The user's marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. \n\nThe user has a marital status via ff:hasMaritalStatus. So the marital status node must have ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood = true. \n\nWait, the DataProperty newUnionAfterWidowhood is on the MaritalStatus instance. So the user's hasMaritalStatus must point to a MaritalStatus where that property is true. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL shape would have two SHACL constraints. \n\nFirst, for the insurance:\n\n- The user must have at least one ff:hasInsurance that is a ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nSecond, the user must have a marital status (via ff:hasMaritalStatus) which has the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. \n\nSo, translating into SHACL. \n\nThe SHACL shape starts with a node shape targeting ff:User. \n\nFor the first condition:\n\nA property shape for ff:hasInsurance with sh:minCount 1, and sh:class ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nWait, but maybe the insurance itself is an instance, so the property must be present and the value must be of that type. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have at least one hasInsurance where the object is of type StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nYes, so using sh:class on the path ff:hasInsurance would require that all values of hasInsurance are of that class, but since we need at least one, perhaps better to have sh:minCount 1 and sh:class. \n\nWait, SHACL's sh:class is for the value to be a node of that class. So:\n\nshape for ff:hasInsurance:\nsh:path ff:hasInsurance;\nsh:minCount 1;\nsh:class ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nThat way, the user must have at least one insurance that is exactly of that type. \n\nSecond condition: \n\nThe user's hasMaritalStatus must link to a marital status (e.g., Married or CivilUnion) which has newUnionAfterWidowhood = true. \n\nWait, the DataProperty newUnionAfterWidowhood is on the MaritalStatus instances. So the marital status instance must have that property set to true. \n\nTherefore, the user's hasMaritalStatus must have a value (the marital status instance) that has the property newUnionAfterWidowhood with true. \n\nTo express this in SHACL, we can use a nested property path. The path would be ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood, and the value should be true. \n\nSo, the property shape for the marital status condition would be:\n\nsh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasMaritalStatus; sh:property ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ];\nsh:hasValue true.\n\nWait, maybe better to use a nested path:\n\nsh:path [ \n    sh:propertyPath ff:hasMaritalStatus ; \n    sh:propertyPath ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood \n];\nsh:hasValue true.\n\nAlternatively, the path can be written as a chain: \n\nsh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood )\n\nWait, but ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property, so the path would be:\n\nff:hasMaritalStatus followed by the data property. \n\nYes, so:\n\nsh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus/[ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood]\n\nBut in SHACL, the syntax for property paths with data properties is to use sh:propertyPath or sh:property. \n\nAlternatively, using sh:propertyPath with the data property:\n\nsh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood )\n\nThis path would navigate from the user to their marital status, then to the value of newUnionAfterWidowhood. \n\nSo the property shape would require that this path has a value of true. \n\nTherefore, the constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood );\n    sh:hasValue true;\n].\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape would have two such constraints. \n\nNow, check for any other possible conditions. The problem mentions that requirements which are ambiguous or at third party discretion should be excluded. The given conditions seem clear enough. \n\nAlso, ensure that only SHACL Core components are used. The components here are sh:MinCount, sh:class, sh:hasValue. All within Core. \n\nNow, the SHACL graph should be in Turtle. Let's structure it:\n\nThe shape is for ff:User, so:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    ], [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the first property is about ff:hasInsurance. The user must have at least one insurance that is of type StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have an insurance, and that insurance must be exactly StatutoryAccidentInsurance. But ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance is an individual in the ontology. Wait, looking back, the ontology lists ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an individual of type ff:Insurance. \n\nWait, in the ontology, under Individuals, there is an entry:\n\nIndividual: ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance\n    Types: ff:Insurance \n\nSo it's an instance of Insurance. Therefore, the user must have an ff:hasInsurance that is exactly that instance. \n\nAh! This is a critical point. The first condition says \"anspruch auf Hinterbliebenenleistung aus der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung\". The statutory accident insurance is an instance (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance), so the user must have an insurance that is that specific instance. \n\nTherefore, the constraint should require that the user's hasInsurance includes that specific individual. \n\nTherefore, instead of using sh:class, we need to check that the value of hasInsurance is exactly ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nSo the first property shape should be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n].\n\nWait, but the user might have multiple insurances. To require that at least one of them is exactly ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance, the sh:hasValue would require that all values are that, which is not right. Instead, we need to ensure that at least one of the hasInsurance values is equal to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. \n\nTo do that in SHACL, we can use sh:in with a list containing that individual. \n\nWait, sh:in takes a list of allowed values. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in ( ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ) ;\n].\n\nThis would ensure that at least one of the hasInsurance values is in the list, i.e., exactly that individual. \n\nAlternatively, if the user must have that insurance (so exactly one?), but the condition just requires having the claim from that insurance, so having that insurance is sufficient. \n\nSo that's better. \n\nSo correcting the first constraint to use sh:in. \n\nThe second condition is about the marital status's newUnionAfterWidowhood being true. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape would look like:\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ) ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] .\n\nThis should satisfy both conditions. \n\nChecking again the ontology for any possible mistakes. \n\nFor the first condition, the user must have a claim on survivors' benefits from statutory accident insurance. The hasInsurance must include the specific insurance instance. \n\nThe second condition: newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property of the marital status instance. So the path is correct. \n\nYes, this should work. \n\nNow, serializing in Turtle and ensuring the prefixes are correctly included. The user's SHACL should be enclosed in triple backticks as per the instructions. \n\nAlso, the social benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102799525, but since the SHACL is for the user's eligibility, the shape doesn't need to reference the benefit directly unless required, but the problem states to target ff:User and model the given conditions, so this should be okay. \n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should look like the above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ) ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. I need to generate a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit described here, targeting the node ff:User. The benefit in question is 'Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung' with IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The user provided three conditions that must be met for eligibility. Let me parse each condition one by one and see how to translate them into SHACL constraints using the given ontology.\n\nFirst, the conditions as listed:\n\n1. \"Sie erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" (You receive benefits of the basic security.)\n2. \"Die Notwendigkeit der Unterstützungsleistung wurde im Gespräch mit Ihrer Integrationsfachkraft festgestellt.\" (The necessity of the support benefit was determined in a conversation with your integration specialist.)\n3. \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" (The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the start of the measure.)\n\nNow, looking at the ontology to map these conditions to existing properties and classes.\n\nStarting with the first condition: \"Erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" The term \"Grundsicherung\" corresponds to \"Grundversorgung\" or \"Grundrecht auf Existenzsicherung\", but in the ontology, there's an individual called ff:IntegrationAssistance (Bürgergeld is another term, but looking at the ontology, ff:B100019_LB_106311931 is Bürgergeld, which is a type of SocialBenefit. Wait, the exact term \"Grundsicherung\" might be represented here. Let me check the ontology's SocialBenefit individuals. There's \"IntegrationAssistance\" which might be the correct term here. The user receives this benefit. So the condition would require that the user is receiving this benefit. The ontology has ff:receivesBenefit which links a person to a social benefit they're currently receiving. So the first condition would be a SHACL constraint that ff:User must have a ff:receivesBenefit that is ff:IntegrationAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: The necessity was determined by an integration specialist. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. The ontology has properties like ff:participates (links a person to a training program they're participating in). But how to model the approval by the integration specialist? Maybe there's a property indicating approval, but looking through the ontology properties, there's ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency for Training, which is a boolean. Wait, the third condition mentions approval by the Jobcenter (Jobcenter is the Employment Agency, so maybe ff:FederalEmploymentAgency?), but the second condition's requirement is about the integration specialist's determination. The ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second condition is about having a certain type of employment status? Wait, perhaps the integration specialist's determination is represented through participation in a program. Alternatively, maybe the second condition is more about the process and not directly modeled in the ontology. Since SHACL can't capture process steps, only existing data properties, maybe this condition is ambiguous or not directly representable. The user's instruction says not to model requirements that are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. Since this condition depends on an external determination (by the integration specialist), which isn't a property in the ontology, perhaps this cannot be modeled and should be excluded. Wait, but maybe there's a property that indicates that the necessity was determined. Alternatively, maybe the participation in a specific type of measure? Hmm, this might be ambiguous because it's a process step rather than a static property. So maybe this condition can't be captured and should be excluded.\n\nThird condition: \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" Participation was approved by Jobcenter before the measure's start. Looking at the ontology, the ff:Training class has a property ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency (a boolean), which might indicate approval by the Employment Agency (Jobcenter). Since the measure is a training, the user's participation in a training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency. Also, the timing aspect (\"vor Maßnahmebeginn\") might be tricky. Since SHACL can't validate temporal aspects (like whether approval happened before the start), unless there's a property indicating that the approval exists. So assuming that the approval is represented by the ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency being true on the training. Additionally, the user must be participating in such a training (via ff:participates). So the conditions would be: the user participates in a training that is commissioned by the Employment Agency.\n\nWait, but how do we link the user's participation to the training's properties? In SHACL, to express that the user's participates property must point to a training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nNow, let's structure this.\n\nThe first condition is straightforward: the user must receive the IntegrationAssistance (Grundsicherung).\n\nSecond condition may not be modelable, so we exclude it as per the rules.\n\nThird condition requires that the user is participating in a training that was commissioned by the Employment Agency (Jobcenter). So:\n\n- The user must have a ff:participates link to a training (ff:Training) which has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true.\n\nNow, structuring this in SHACL.\n\nThe SHACL graph will have a shape for the User node. Let's start with the first condition:\n\nThe User must have a ff:receivesBenefit that is ff:IntegrationAssistance. So:\n\nShape for ff:User:\n- Property path: ff:receivesBenefit\n- sh:hasValue: ff:IntegrationAssistance\n\nWait, but receivesBenefit can have multiple values. Alternatively, it must have at least one instance of receivesBenefit that is IntegrationAssistance. So the correct way is to use sh:hasValue to require that the value is exactly IntegrationAssistance? Or perhaps sh:property with sh:in including that individual.\n\nWait, SHACL's sh:hasValue would require that the object is exactly that. But since the user might receive multiple benefits, the condition is that at least one of them is IntegrationAssistance. So the correct approach is to use sh:property with sh:in (including IntegrationAssistance) and sh:minCount 1.\n\nAlternatively, since IntegrationAssistance is an individual, the condition is that the user has a receivesBenefit link to that individual.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance;\n]\n\nWait, but sh:hasValue with sh:minCount 1 would require that the user has at least one receivesBenefit that is exactly IntegrationAssistance. That's correct.\n\nNow the third condition: the user's participation in a training that is commissioned by the employment agency. The user must have a participates link to a training where commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nIn SHACL, this is a nested constraint. So we need to use sh:property with a path to the training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency.\n\nThe path would be ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n]\n\nWait, but the user must have at least one participation in a training where that property is true. So the path ff:participates/ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency must have at least one true value. So the constraint is that the user has a participates link to a training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nAlternatively, the shape for the training would need to have that property, but in SHACL you can model this with a shape that the participates node must have that property.\n\nAlternatively, the path would be ff:participates followed by the property on that node. So using a property path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:participates; sh:and (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n      ) ];\n]\n\nHmm, maybe better to structure it as:\n\nThe user must have at least one participates object that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n            sh:hasValue true;\n        ];\n    ];\n]\n\nThat's the correct way to express that at least one of the participates targets must have that property.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape for the User would have two constraints: the receivesBenefit must include IntegrationAssistance, and the participates must include a training with commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nNow, check the ontology to confirm the exact URIs:\n\n- IntegrationAssistance is indeed an individual of SocialBenefit (ff:IntegrationAssistance)\n- ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is a data property of ff:Training, range xsd:boolean.\n\nYes, that's all correct.\n\nThe second condition about the integration specialist's determination is not directly modeled in the ontology, so we can't include it. The user's instructions say to exclude ambiguous or third-party discretion conditions, so that's okay.\n\nNow, writing the SHACL in Turtle:\n\nThe shapes graph will define a shape targeting ff:User, with two properties: receivesBenefit and participates with the qualified constraint.\n\nAlso, the shapes graph must use the SHACL prefixes and correctly reference the ontology URIs.\n\nThe SHACL shape would look like this:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EligibilityShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, when using qualifiedValueShape, the path is the path to the objects you're constraining. Since participates is an object property to Training, the qualifiedValueShape is applied to each object of participates, so this should be correct.\n\nThat should cover the first and third conditions. The second condition is not modeled because it can't be directly represented with the given ontology properties.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:EligibilityShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1: User must receive Integration Assistance (Grundsicherung)\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 3: Participation in a training approved by Jobcenter\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit.

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -
