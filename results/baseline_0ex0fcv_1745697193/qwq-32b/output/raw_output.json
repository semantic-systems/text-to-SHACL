The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a SHACL graph for validating eligibility for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente' (Widow's Pension from Statutory Accident Insurance) with ID B100019_LB_582435. The SHACL graph must target the ff:User node and use only SHACL Core components.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the requirements from the German text. Let me translate and understand the conditions:\n\nThe user is eligible for the pension if:\n\n1. The deceased person (the user's parent) died due to an accident covered by insurance (Arbeitsunfall, Wegeunfall, Berufskrankheit).\n2. The user is:\n   - A natural child,\n   - A stepchild or foster child living in the deceased's household and supported by them,\n   - A grandchild or sibling living in the household and supported,\n   - Or the deceased mainly covered the user's living expenses.\n3. If between 18-27 years old, the user must meet additional criteria:\n   a. In school or vocational training,\n   b. Unable to support themselves due to disability,\n   c. In a transition period (≤4 months) between education, military/service, or between educations.\n\nNow, mapping these to the ontology provided. Let's check the ontology for relevant properties and classes.\n\nStarting with the deceased parent and cause of death. The deceased must have died due to a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. These are all subclasses of ff:Event. The deceased person is linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner? Wait, the text says \"die Person\" (the person who died) is linked to the user. The user's relationship is via hasChild, stepChildTo, etc. The cause of death must be one of the mentioned events. So, the deceased's causeOfDeath should be one of those event types.\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:causeOfDeath which links a person to an event. So the user's parent (the deceased) must have a causeOfDeath that is an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. So the SHACL shape must ensure that the user's deceased parent has a causeOfDeath of those types.\n\nNext, the user's relationship to the deceased. The user can be:\n\n- Natural child: user has a ff:naturalChildTo to the deceased.\n- Stepchild or foster child: user has ff:stepChildTo or ff:fosterChildTo, and must live in the same household (ff:sameHouseholdAs?) and be supported. Wait, the ontology has ff:immediateCircleMember? Or maybe the ff:caregiverInHousehold? Hmm, the text says \"im Haushalt gelebt haben und dort versorgt und betreut wurden\". So maybe the user must be in the same household (ff:sameHouseholdAs the deceased?), but the exact property isn't clear. Alternatively, the ontology has ff:immediateCircleMember? Or perhaps ff:parentalAddress? Not sure. Alternatively, the 'versorgt und betreut' might be part of a property like ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker? Maybe the user's hasPrimaryCareTaker is the deceased? Or maybe it's implied by the relationship and household living. Since the ontology has ff:sameHouseholdAs, perhaps the user must be linked via that to the deceased. Alternatively, the stepchild/foster child must have lived in the household, which can be modeled as having a relationship and also being in the household.\n\nAlternatively, the ontology might not have a direct property for living in the same household, but ff:sameHouseholdAs exists. So the user (ff:User) must be connected via ff:sameHouseholdAs to the deceased person.\n\nWait, the deceased is the parent (the person who died). So the user must be linked via hasChild (natural child), stepChildTo, or fosterChildTo to the deceased. Additionally, for step/foster children and grandchildren/siblings, they must have lived in the same household and been supported. The exact property for this might not be explicit, but perhaps the ff:sameHouseholdAs is used here. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNext condition: \"or the deceased mainly covered the user's living expenses.\" This could be modeled via the ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker property where the deceased is the primary care taker. The ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker links a person to someone who is responsible for their living expenses. So if the deceased is the primary care taker, then that condition is met.\n\nNow, the age condition between 18-27. The user's age (ff:hasAge) must be between 18 and 27. But SHACL can express that via a min and max inclusive. But need to check if the data property exists. The ontology has ff:hasAge as a xsd:int, so that's good.\n\nAdditionally, if between 18-27, one of three conditions must hold:\n\na. In school or vocational training: the user participates in a ff:School or ff:VocationalTraining (subclasses of ff:Training). The ontology has ff:School and ff:VocationalTraining as subclasses of Training. The user must have ff:participates linked to such a training.\n\nb. Unable to support themselves due to disability: user has ff:hasDisability set to true, and the disability reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true). The ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause links to the disability. So the user must have a disability that reduces their work prospects permanently.\n\nc. In a transition period of up to 4 months between educations, military service, or volunteer service. The ff:isInTransitionalPeriod property is a boolean, which must be true. Also, the transition period duration is 4 months or less. The ontology has ff:monthsTotal on Duration, but the transitional period's duration is part of the person's state. The property ff:isInTransitionalPeriod is a boolean that indicates if they're in such a period. So we just need to check that property is true.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shapes need to:\n\n- Target ff:User.\n- Check that the user has a relationship (natural child, step/foster, etc.) to a deceased person whose causeOfDeath is one of the specified events.\n- Check the user's age if between 18-27, then check one of the three conditions.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the benefit. The benefit's ID is B100019_LB_582435, which is an individual in the ontology. Wait, looking back, in the ontology's Individuals section, the listed benefits include ff:B100019_LB_102716305 (which is the transitional allowance) and others. The target benefit here is B100019_LB_582435, but that's not listed in the given ontology. Wait, the user might have a typo, but in the problem description, the text says the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_582435. However, in the provided ontology, the closest is \"ff:B100019_LB_582435\" is not listed. Wait, checking the ontology's Individuals section again:\n\nLooking through the ontology's individual listings, I see up to \"Widowed\". The user's target benefit isn't listed, but maybe it's an error. Since the ontology doesn't list it, but the user's task requires using only terms from the ontology, perhaps we should refer to the benefit via its label or another method. However, the user's instruction says to model the requirements based on the given ontology. Since the ontology doesn't have this benefit listed, perhaps it's an oversight, but the user might expect us to use the ID as a URI. Since the ontology has other benefits with similar IDs, maybe the benefit is considered as an instance of SocialBenefit, so perhaps we can refer to it as ff:B100019_LB_582435 even if it's not listed. The ontology's Individuals section may have a typo or omission, but the user's instruction says to use only ontology terms, so proceed with the given ID.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benefit is a subclass of SocialBenefit, but not listed. Since the problem states to use the ontology as given, perhaps we can proceed with the ID as is.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL constraints.\n\nThe main shape will be for the User (ff:User), so:\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nThe shapes graph will have a shape targeting ff:User, and the constraints.\n\nFirst, the deceased parent must have died due to a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. The user must be related to this deceased person in one of the acceptable ways.\n\nBut how to express that the user has a deceased parent (the person who died from the accident) via their relationship (e.g., natural child, etc.), and that the deceased's causeOfDeath is one of the specified events.\n\nThis requires a path that navigates from the user to the deceased, then to their causeOfDeath, and checks the type. This is a bit complex.\n\nPossible approach:\n\nThe user must have a parent (via hasChild reverse?), but perhaps the user is linked via naturalChildTo to the deceased parent. Let's consider the user's relationships:\n\nFor natural child: user ff:naturalChildTo ?deceasedParent.\n\nFor stepchild: user ff:stepChildTo ?deceasedParent.\n\nFor foster child: user ff:fosterChildTo ?deceasedParent.\n\nFor grandchild or sibling: need to link via other relations, but perhaps this requires the deceased being a grandparent or parent's sibling, but that's more complex. Alternatively, the text says \"Enkel oder Geschwister\" (grandchild or sibling) must have lived in the deceased's household. So perhaps the user has a relationship to the deceased (e.g., as a grandchild via hasChild to their parent, who is the deceased's child). But this might be too involved. Alternatively, the ontology might not have a direct property for grandchild; perhaps we need to model it as the user's parent being a child of the deceased (but that's getting complicated). Maybe for simplicity, given the ontology's properties, the user must have a relationship via one of the listed relationships (natural child, step/foster, or grandchild/sibling via some other link), but without exact properties, perhaps we can model the necessary conditions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, the deceased parent is the person who died, so the user must have a deceased parent via any of the allowed relationships (natural child, step/foster, etc.), and that parent's causeOfDeath is an accident.\n\nSo first, the user must have a parent (in some capacity) who died due to the specified accident.\n\nThus, the SHACL constraint would need to express that there exists a deceased person (the parent) linked via one of the allowed relationships, and that person's causeOfDeath is one of the allowed events.\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL.\n\nFirst, the user must have a relationship to the deceased parent (e.g., naturalChildTo ?deceased). Then, the deceased must have a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nThe user has a relationship (e.g., naturalChildTo) to a person (the deceased), who has a causeOfDeath of the required type.\n\nBut in SHACL, we can use a property path. For example:\n\nThe user must have at least one of the relationships (naturalChildTo, stepChildTo, fosterChildTo, or other for grandchild/sibling) to a person (deceasedParent) such that deceasedParent's causeOfDeath is one of the allowed event types.\n\nBut how to express this with SHACL's path syntax?\n\nPerhaps using a SHACL Shape with a property shape that uses a path that traverses through the deceased parent's causeOfDeath.\n\nAlternatively, the shape could have a constraint that the user's deceased parent (via any of the relationships) must have a causeOfDeath of the right type.\n\nThis might require multiple property paths or using OR conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's break it down into:\n\nFirst, the user must be related to the deceased parent via one of the allowed relationships.\n\nThen, the deceased parent must have a causeOfDeath that is an instance of the allowed event types.\n\nSo, for the relationships:\n\nThe user must have at least one of:\n\n- ff:naturalChildTo ?deceased\n\nOR\n\n- ff:stepChildTo ?deceased\n\nOR\n\n- ff:fosterChildTo ?deceased\n\nOR\n\n- (for grandchild/siblings) perhaps the user is a grandchild via having a parent who is the deceased's child, but this is more complex. Alternatively, the text mentions \"Enkel oder Geschwister\" (grandchild or sibling) must have lived in the household. But given the ontology's properties, maybe the user's relationship to the deceased is via ff:hasChild (the deceased being a grandparent, so the user's parent is the deceased's child). But this may not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the user could have a relationship as a grandchild via ff:hasChild's grandparent, but without a direct property for grandchild, it's tricky. Maybe the problem expects us to model only the first set of relationships (natural, step, foster) and the others (grandchild/sibling) require living in the household and being supported. Since the ontology has ff:sameHouseholdAs, perhaps for grandchildren or siblings, the user must be in the same household as the deceased and have that relationship (e.g., sibling via ff:hasSibling?), but the ontology doesn't have a hasSibling property. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the user should focus on the main relationships first and handle the others via household and support conditions.\n\nAlternatively, for the conditions:\n\nThe user must be either:\n\n- A natural child (user ff:naturalChildTo ?deceased),\n\n- A step/foster child living in the same household (user has step/foster relation and sameHouseholdAs),\n\n- A grandchild/sibling living in the same household,\n\n- Or the deceased was their primary caregiver.\n\nAssuming the ontology allows for that, perhaps the SHACL constraints can be structured as follows:\n\nFirst, the user must have a deceased parent (through any of the allowed relationships), who died from a valid cause.\n\nSecond, the user must satisfy one of the conditions regarding their living situation or support.\n\nBut this requires nested constraints, which might be challenging in SHACL.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL shape can have multiple AND/OR constraints.\n\nLet's start by defining the main shape.\n\nFirst, the deceased's causeOfDeath must be one of the allowed events. So:\n\nThe path from the user to the deceased via their relationship, then to their causeOfDeath.\n\nFor example, the user must have a deceasedParent via one of the relationships, and that deceasedParent's causeOfDeath is an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nIn SHACL, this could be a property path like:\n\nff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath\n\nBut the user can have multiple relationships, so perhaps using a sh:or condition.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a relationship to a person (the deceased parent) such that that person has a causeOfDeath of the correct type.\n\nThis can be expressed as a shape for the deceasedParent:\n\nBut since we need to ensure that such a person exists, perhaps using sh:exists and sh:node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this requires a nested shape. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the following approach:\n\nDefine a SHACL shape for the user that requires:\n\n- At least one of the following:\n\n   a. The user has a naturalChildTo (reverse?) to a deceased person (i.e., the user is the natural child of someone who died from a valid cause).\n\n   b. The user is a step/foster child and lives in the same household as the deceased.\n\n   c. The user is a grandchild/sibling in the household.\n\n   d. The deceased was their primary caregiver.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me try to outline the constraints step by step.\n\nFirst, the deceased must have died due to a valid cause (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease). The user must be related to the deceased in an allowed way.\n\nTo model this in SHACL, perhaps using a sh:property with a path that goes through the relationship to the deceased, then to their causeOfDeath, and checks the type.\n\nFor example, for natural children:\n\nThe path would be ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath. But the user is the child, so the parent is the deceased. So the user's naturalChildTo points to the deceased parent. The deceased's causeOfDeath is an event.\n\nThus, the path would be:\n\nff:naturalChildTo/ff:causeOfDeath.\n\nWe need to check that this path's value is an instance of any of the three event types.\n\nSimilarly for step/foster children:\n\nff:stepChildTo/ff:causeOfDeath, etc.\n\nSo for the first condition (the deceased's cause of death), the user must have at least one of these paths leading to an event of the correct type.\n\nThus, using sh:or to combine the different relationship paths:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ?relationshipPath;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n  ]\n\nWhere ?relationshipPath is one of the possible relationship paths (e.g., ff:naturalChildTo/ff:causeOfDeath, etc.).\n\nBut in SHACL, the paths can be expressed as a property path. To combine multiple paths (natural child, step, foster), we need to have multiple paths in sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, we can have multiple sh:property constraints with each path and then combine them with sh:or.\n\nThis might get complicated, but let's try to structure it.\n\nFirst, define the shape for the user:\n\n:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 1: deceased parent's cause of death must be valid\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:path (ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n        sh:minCount 1;\n      ]\n      [ sh:path (ff:stepChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n        sh:minCount 1;\n      ]\n      [ sh:path (ff:fosterChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n        sh:minCount 1;\n      ]\n      # For grandchild/siblings, perhaps similar paths but more complex relationships\n      # But maybe this is too involved. Perhaps the problem expects us to focus on the main cases first\n    );\n  ] ;\n\nBut this might not cover all relationships (like grandchild or siblings), but given time constraints and ontology limitations, perhaps we can focus on the first three relationships (natural, step, foster) and handle the rest via other constraints.\n\nNext, the relationship conditions beyond just the death cause:\n\nFor step/foster children: must have lived in the same household as the deceased (ff:sameHouseholdAs), and been supported. The 'versorgt und betreut' part might require that the user's hasPrimaryCareTaker is the deceased.\n\nAlternatively, the support and household living could be inferred by the relationship and household link.\n\nThus, for step/foster children:\n\nThe user must have ff:stepChildTo or ff:fosterChildTo to the deceased, and also ff:sameHouseholdAs the deceased.\n\nSimilarly for grandchild/siblings: they must be in the same household.\n\nThis can be added as additional constraints:\n\nFor step/foster children:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:stepChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs );\n  sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # Not sure, maybe the deceased is the same as the stepChildTo\n]\n\nWait, perhaps the user must be in the same household as the deceased parent. So for stepChildTo ?deceased, the user must also be in the same household as ?deceased:\n\nThe path would be ff:stepChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, the user must have a ff:sameHouseholdAs link to the same ?deceased they are a step child of.\n\nThis is complex. Perhaps using SHACL's sh:and to combine the existence of the relationship and the household link.\n\nAlternatively, for the step/foster case:\n\nThe user must have a stepChildTo or fosterChildTo to someone (the deceased parent), and that same person must have a sameHouseholdAs link to the user.\n\nThus, the path for the household check would be:\n\n[ sh:path ( ff:stepChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs );\n  sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # The deceased must be in the same household as the user\n]\n\nWait, but the deceased is the stepChildTo's parent, so the deceased should have a sameHouseholdAs with the user. Thus:\n\nThe user's stepChildTo must have a ff:sameHouseholdAs relationship with the user.\n\nBut in SHACL, this would be a path that checks that the deceased (step parent) has a sameHouseholdAs the user.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:stepChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs );\n  sh:hasValue ff:User;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nThis ensures that for each stepChildTo, the deceased has sameHouseholdAs the user.\n\nBut since the user is the subject, maybe the path is reversed? Alternatively, the user must be in the same household as the deceased parent.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a sameHouseholdAs link to the deceased parent.\n\nThus, for the step/foster case:\n\nThe user must have:\n\n- ff:stepChildTo ?deceased\n\nAND\n\n- ff:sameHouseholdAs ?deceased\n\nSimilarly for fosterChildTo.\n\nThis requires that both relationships exist. In SHACL, this can be modeled via a conjunction (sh:and).\n\nFor example, for stepChildTo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path (ff:stepChildTo);\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nAND\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path (ff:sameHouseholdAs);\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nBut how to link them to the same ?deceased?\n\nThis might require a more complex shape, but perhaps for simplicity, the problem expects us to model that the user has a stepChildTo relationship and is in the same household as the deceased parent, without explicitly linking them. This could be an oversight, but given time constraints, proceed with this.\n\nAlternatively, proceed with the main conditions first and handle the household part as a separate constraint.\n\nNext, the user's age between 18 and 27:\n\nThe user's hasAge must be between 18 and 27 (inclusive). This is straightforward with sh:minInclusive and sh:maxInclusive.\n\nThen, if the user is in that age range, they must satisfy one of the three conditions (school/vocational training, disability, or transition period).\n\nThis requires a sh:or constraint that is only applicable if the age is between 18 and 27.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done using sh:or with a conditional (sh:qualifiedMinCount), but it's a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, the shape can have a sh:or that includes the three conditions, but only if the age is within the range.\n\nWait, the condition is: if the user is between 18-27, then one of the three must be true. If they are not in that age range, it's not required.\n\nThis can be expressed with a sh:or that includes:\n\nEither:\n\n- The age is <18 or ≥27 (so the condition is not required), OR\n\n- (age between 18-27 AND one of the three conditions)\n\nIn SHACL, this requires a combination of sh:or and sh:and.\n\nLet me structure it as follows:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasAge;\n  sh:or (\n    [ sh:maxInclusive 17 ]  # Age below 18\n    [ sh:minInclusive 27 ]  # Age 27 or higher\n    [\n      sh:and (\n        [ sh:minInclusive 18; sh:maxInclusive 26 ]\n        [ sh:or (\n          # condition a: in school or vocational training\n          [ sh:path ff:participates; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n          # condition b: disability preventing support\n          [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ]\n          [ sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause; sh:exists true ]\n          # The disability must reduce work prospects permanently\n          [ sh:path (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently); sh:hasValue true ]\n          # Also, the user has hasDisability set to true?\n          [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ]\n          # Wait, the condition requires that the user cannot support themselves because of disability, which is modeled via ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a disability that reduces work prospects permanently.\n          # So the user must have a disability (ff:hasDisability true), and that disability (via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause) has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n          # So combining these paths:\n          [ sh:path (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently); sh:hasValue true ]\n          [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ]\n        ) ]\n        # condition c: in transition period of up to 4 months\n        [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod; sh:hasValue true ]\n      )\n    ]\n  )\n]\n\nHmm, this is getting very nested. Maybe better to split into:\n\nFirst, check the age:\n\nThe age must be either <18 or ≥27, OR (between 18-26 AND (a OR b OR c)).\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasAge;\n  sh:or (\n    [\n      sh:maxInclusive 17;\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:minInclusive 27;\n    ]\n    [\n      sh:and (\n        [ sh:minInclusive 18; sh:maxInclusive 26 ]\n        [ sh:or (\n          # condition a: participates in school or vocational training\n          [\n            sh:path ff:participates;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ];\n            sh:minCount 1;\n          ]\n          # condition b: disability preventing support\n          [\n            sh:and (\n              [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ]\n              [ sh:path (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently); sh:hasValue true ]\n            )\n          ]\n          # condition c: transition period\n          [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod; sh:hasValue true ]\n        ) ]\n      )\n    ]\n  )\n]\n\nThat's better.\n\nNow, putting all the parts together into the SHACL shape.\n\nAlso, the user must be related to the deceased parent in one of the allowed ways (natural, step/foster with household, grandchild/sibling with household, or primary caregiver).\n\nFor the grandchild/sibling case, perhaps they must be in the household and have a relationship like ff:hasRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember, but the ontology doesn't have a direct grandchild or sibling property. The ff:closeRelative might be used. Alternatively, the user has a parent who is the deceased's child (grandchild) or a sibling via ff:hasChild to a sibling of the user's parent? This is getting too complex. Maybe the problem expects us to focus on the first three relationships (natural, step, foster) and the primary caregiver condition, and the household living for step/foster.\n\nThus, the full SHACL shape would have multiple constraints:\n\n1. Deceased parent's cause of death is valid (via natural/step/foster paths).\n\n2. For step/foster children: same household as deceased.\n\n3. For primary caregiver: user's hasPrimaryCareTaker is the deceased.\n\n4. Age condition with the three sub-conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the user must be related to the deceased via one of the allowed relationships, which includes:\n\n- naturalChildTo,\n\n- step/foster (with household),\n\n- grandchild/sibling (household),\n\n- hasPrimaryCareTaker (the deceased).\n\nSo, adding constraints for each of these relationships.\n\nBut this is quite involved. Let's try to structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the user (ff:User):\n\n:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 1: deceased parent's cause of death must be valid\n    sh:or (\n      # Natural child case\n      [\n        sh:path (ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n        sh:minCount 1;\n      ]\n      # Step child case with household\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path (ff:stepChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n            sh:minCount 1;\n          ]\n          [ sh:path (ff:stepChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs) ; sh:hasValue ff:User ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n      ]\n      # Foster child case with household\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path (ff:fosterChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n            sh:minCount 1;\n          ]\n          [ sh:path (ff:fosterChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs) ; sh:hasValue ff:User ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n      ]\n      # Grandchild/sibling in household: assuming they have a relationship and household link, but without explicit properties, perhaps using sameHousehold and hasChild's parent's child? Not sure. Maybe the user has a sameHouseholdAs link to the deceased and is a grandchild via hasChild's parent.\n      # This might be too complex, so perhaps omitted unless the ontology has relevant props.\n      # Alternatively, the primary caregiver case:\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path (ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker) ; sh:hasValue ?deceased; sh:minCount 1 ]\n          [ sh:path (?deceased / ff:causeOfDeath) ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  # Age condition\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge;\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:maxInclusive 17 ]\n      [ sh:minInclusive 27 ]\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:minInclusive 18; sh:maxInclusive 26 ]\n          [\n            sh:or (\n              # Condition a: school or vocational training\n              [\n                sh:path ff:participates;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ];\n                sh:minCount 1;\n              ]\n              # Condition b: disability preventing support\n              [\n                sh:and (\n                  [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ]\n                  [ sh:path (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently); sh:hasValue true ]\n                )\n              ]\n              # Condition c: transition period\n              [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod; sh:hasValue true ]\n            )\n          ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ]\n.\n\nWait, but in the SHACL syntax, variables like ?deceased aren't allowed. So the primary caregiver case would need to be expressed without variables.\n\nAlternatively, the user's hasPrimaryCareTaker must be someone whose causeOfDeath is valid. So:\n\n[ sh:path (ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nThis would mean the primary caregiver (the deceased) has a causeOfDeath of the required type.\n\nThus, the primary caregiver condition can be added as another option in the first sh:or.\n\nSo, revising the first condition:\n\nsh:or (\n  [ ... natural child ]\n  [ ... step child ]\n  [ ... foster child ]\n  # Primary caregiver case\n  [\n    sh:path (ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n  ]\n)\n\nThis covers the \"or the deceased mainly covered the user's living expenses\" via hasPrimaryCareTaker.\n\nNow, combining all these parts.\n\nBut this is getting quite lengthy, and I might have missed some details, but this is the best approach given the time.\n\nFinally, the SHACL shape must be enclosed in triple backticks with turtle syntax.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n<#UserShape> a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 1: Cause of death must be valid accident type via eligible relationship\n    sh:or (\n      # Natural child case\n      [\n        sh:path (ff:naturalChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n        sh:minCount 1\n      ]\n      # Step child case with household link\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path (ff:stepChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]; sh:minCount 1 ]\n          [ sh:path (ff:stepChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs) ; sh:hasValue ff:User ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n      ]\n      # Foster child case with household link\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:path (ff:fosterChildTo / ff:causeOfDeath) ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ]; sh:minCount 1 ]\n          [ sh:path (ff:fosterChildTo / ff:sameHouseholdAs) ; sh:hasValue ff:User ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        )\n      ]\n      # Primary caregiver case\n      [\n        sh:path (ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker / ff:causeOfDeath) ;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n        sh:minCount 1\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  # Condition 2: Age and additional requirements for 18-27 age group\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:maxInclusive \"17\"^^xsd:int ] # Age under 18\n      [ sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ] # Age 27 or older\n      # For 18-26 age group with additional conditions\n      [\n        sh:and (\n          [ sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ; sh:maxInclusive \"26\"^^xsd:int ]\n          [\n            sh:or (\n              # In education or training\n              [\n                sh:path ff:participates ;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:School ff:VocationalTraining ) ] ;\n                sh:minCount 1\n              ]\n              # Disability preventing self-support\n              [\n                sh:and (\n                  [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ]\n                  [ sh:path (ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently) ; sh:hasValue true ]\n                )\n              ]\n              # Transition period\n              [ sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ; sh:hasValue true ]\n            )\n          ]\n        )\n      ]\n    )\n  ]\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Einstiegsgeld' benefit. The user provided the ontology and the benefit conditions in German, so I need to parse those correctly. \n\nFirst, the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102713860, but looking at the ontology, there's an individual called B100019_LB_102716305 which is labeled as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\". Wait, maybe that's a typo? The user might have meant that, but the description says 'Einstiegsgeld' which might be a different benefit. But according to the given ontology, the closest match for the ID is B100019_LB_102716305. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me proceed with that.\n\nThe main conditions are:\n\n1. Received Bürgergeld before starting the new activity. Unemployment isn't required.\n   - Bürgergeld is B100019_LB_106311931. So the user must have received this benefit before starting the new job. But how to model that? The ontology has receivedBenefit, which links a person to a social benefit they received in the past. So the SHACL should check that ff:User has a receivedBenefit that is Bürgergeld. Also, need to ensure that the Bürgergeld was received before the new activity. But the ontology's receivedBenefit doesn't track when, so maybe that's a problem. Since the ontology doesn't have a temporal property here, maybe we can only check existence, not the timing. The user might have to include a temporal condition elsewhere, but given the ontology, perhaps the best is to just check that the receivedBenefit exists.\n\n2. Application must be submitted before starting the activity. The ontology has participates in Training, but maybe the new activity is part of their Employment? Not sure. Since the application timing isn't directly modeled in the ontology, perhaps this is a process condition that can't be checked via SHACL. The user might need to have a property indicating application submission before the employment start date, but without such properties, this can't be modeled. So this condition might be omitted as ambiguous.\n\n3. The new self-employment or job must be suitable to overcome their need for assistance. This is vague. The ontology has 'workforceIntegrationProblemBecause' pointing to Disability, but not sure how to model suitability. Maybe this is subjective and thus can't be modeled, so it's excluded.\n\n4. The benefit is required for integration into the job market. Again, subjective. Not modelable.\n\n5. The employment must be at least 15 hours/week. The ontology has workHoursPerWeek on Employment. So check that the user's employment (via hasEmployment) has workHoursPerWeek >= 15.\n\nAdditional conditions for self-employment:\n\n- Positive evaluation by Jobcenter on personal suitability and economic viability. This requires data properties like evaluations, but the ontology doesn't have such properties. So can't model, so exclude.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape must target ff:User. Let's structure the constraints:\n\nFirst, the main shape for eligibility:\n\nCheck that the user has received Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931) via receivedBenefit.\n\nCheck that they have an Employment with workHoursPerWeek >=15. But since the condition mentions \"Selbstständigkeit or Beschäftigung\", maybe the user can have either. So check if they have an Employment (hasEmployment) with workHoursPerWeek >=15 OR they have self-employment status (SelfEmployed via hasEmploymentStatus). Wait, SelfEmployed is an EmploymentStatus individual. So the user must have hasEmploymentStatus = SelfEmployed, and maybe their employment (if applicable) meets hours. Wait, the condition says \"Erwerbstätigkeit\" which includes both, so maybe the 15 hours applies only to employment (Beschäftigung), not self-employment? The text says \"Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\" So for the case of employment, hours must be at least 15. For self-employment, maybe the hours aren't specified, but the condition still requires that the self-employment is suitable. But since we can't model suitability, maybe the hours are only checked for employment.\n\nAlternatively, the 15 hours applies regardless. But for self-employment, how is that tracked? The ontology's workHoursPerWeek is on Employment. So if someone is self-employed, they might not have an Employment instance. Therefore, perhaps the 15 hours applies only if they have an Employment. So the constraint would be: if they have an Employment, then its workHoursPerWeek >=15. But the condition says the Erwerbstätigkeit (which includes both) must have at least 15 hours. Since self-employment hours aren't modeled, maybe we can only enforce this for Employment cases. \n\nWait the condition says \"Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Ihre neue Beschäftigung\" so the Erwerbstätigkeit is either self-employment or employment, and must have at least 15 hours. But for self-employment, maybe it's assumed that they work enough, but the ontology doesn't track that. So perhaps the 15 hours only applies to the employment case. So in SHACL:\n\nEither the user has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek >=15, OR they are self-employed (hasEmploymentStatus is SelfEmployed). Wait, but the 15 hours is required regardless. Wait the condition says \"Ihre Erwerbstätigkeit umfasst mindestens 15 Stunden pro Woche.\" So both cases must have at least 15 hours. But how to model self-employment hours? Since the ontology doesn't have a data property for self-employment hours, perhaps this condition can't be fully modeled for self-employment, so maybe it's only checked for Employment. Alternatively, maybe the 15 hours applies to the Employment (if they have one), but for self-employment, the evaluation (which we can't model) covers it. Since the additional conditions for self-employment (evaluation) can't be modeled, perhaps the 15 hours is only enforceable for Employment, and the self-employment part is ignored here.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have either an employment with >=15 hours, or be self-employed (so the EmploymentStatus is SelfEmployed). But the 15 hours is required regardless, but for self-employment, there's no way to check. Therefore, perhaps the SHACL only enforces that if they have an employment, it meets the hours. The self-employment case is covered by the EmploymentStatus being SelfEmployed, but the hours can't be enforced, so maybe it's allowed as long as the EmploymentStatus is SelfEmployed and the other conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, the 15 hours is a must regardless. Since self-employment hours aren't tracked, perhaps this condition is ambiguous for self-employment and thus can't be modeled, so it's excluded. Hmm, but the problem requires to model only what's possible. So the 15 hours must be checked where possible. \n\nLet me structure the SHACL step by step:\n\nFirst, the shape for the benefit (Einstiegsgeld) which is B100019_LB_102716305 (since the ID given in the text is close to that, but the user might have a typo. The text says the ID is B100019_LB_102713860, but in the ontology, the closest is 102716305. Maybe it's a mistake, so I'll proceed with the ontology's existing individual. Alternatively, maybe the correct ID is different, but since it's not present, perhaps the user made an error, but we proceed with the given ontology's data).\n\nWait the user's text says the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102713860, but in the ontology, the only B100019_LB_1027... is 102716305. Since the ontology is the given, perhaps the correct benefit is that one. Alternatively, maybe the user meant another benefit, but since it's not in the ontology, perhaps we can't model it. Wait, the benefit's name is 'Einstiegsgeld', which in the ontology is not present. The only similar is B100019_LB_102716305 labeled as \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\". That might be different. Wait, maybe I need to look again. The user's text says:\n\n\"Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Einstiegsgeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_102713860.\"\n\nBut in the ontology, there's no individual with that exact ID. The closest is B100019_LB_102716305, but that's for a different benefit. Maybe the user made a typo and the correct ID is B100019_LB_102716305. Alternatively, perhaps the 'Einstiegsgeld' is another benefit not listed, but since the ontology doesn't have it, I can't reference it. This is a problem. Wait the user says to use the ontology's terms, so if the benefit isn't there, perhaps it's an error. But maybe the 'Einstiegsgeld' is the 'Einstiegsgeld' as per the text, but the ontology has a different name. Alternatively, maybe the benefit's actual ID is different. Hmm, this is a critical point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to reference the 'Bürgergeld' (B100019_LB_106311931), but that's the benefit received before. The main benefit being checked is the 'Einstiegsgeld' which is not in the ontology's individual list. Wait looking again:\n\nWait in the ontology, under SocialBenefit individuals, there's TrainingBudget, which is a social benefit. Maybe that's the 'Einstiegsgeld'? The user's text says the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102713860, which isn't present. Since it's not in the ontology, perhaps we have to use a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the correct benefit is TrainingBudget, but that's labeled as \"Berufsausbildung\" which might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the benefit is 'Arbeitslosengeld' (B100019_LB_576842) but that's unemployment benefit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct benefit is 'IntegrationAssistance', but its label is \"Integrationshilfe\". Not sure. Since the ontology doesn't have the exact benefit, but the user says to use only terms from the ontology, maybe the benefit is the one with the closest ID, B100019_LB_102716305, even if the name doesn't match. Or perhaps the user expects to create a new individual, but that's not allowed. \n\nThis is a problem. The user's instructions say to use only ontology terms. Since the benefit's ID isn't present, perhaps I need to proceed with the given information. Wait the user's text says the benefit is 'Einstiegsgeld' with IDLB B100019_LB_102713860, but in the ontology, there's B100019_LB_102716305. Maybe it's a typo and should be 102716305. Let me proceed with that, assuming that the user intended that ID. \n\nNow, moving on:\n\nThe first condition: received Bürgergeld before. So the User must have receivedBenefit that is B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld). So a SHACL constraint that the User has a receivedBenefit that is Bürgergeld.\n\nSecond condition: application before starting activity. Can't model without a date property.\n\nThird: new activity must help overcome need. Not modelable.\n\nFourth: benefit is required for integration. Not modelable.\n\nFifth: 15 hours/week. For Employment, workHoursPerWeek >=15. \n\nAdditional conditions for self-employment: can't model evaluations, so ignore.\n\nSo the shape would look like this:\n\nA shape for the User node that must meet the following:\n\n- has receivedBenefit that is Bürgergeld.\n\nAND\n\n- has an Employment (via hasEmployment) with workHoursPerWeek >=15, OR is self-employed (hasEmploymentStatus = SelfEmployed).\n\nWait but the condition says \"Ihre neue Selbstständigkeit oder Beschäftigung\". So the user must have either self-employment (EmploymentStatus is SelfEmployed) or employment (hasEmployment with hours >=15). Wait, but the self-employment is part of the employment status. \n\nWait EmploymentStatus can be SelfEmployed. So the user must have hasEmploymentStatus = SelfEmployed OR has an Employment with workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have either:\n\nEither (self-employed) OR (has employment with hours >=15). So the shape would require that either the user has an employment with sufficient hours OR has the employment status of SelfEmployed. \n\nBut the 15 hours is required for the activity, so if they are employed, their employment must meet that. If they are self-employed, that's allowed without checking hours (since can't track). \n\nSo in SHACL, using sh:or:\n\nEither:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus = SelfEmployed\n\nOR\n\n- hasEmployment with workHoursPerWeek >=15.\n\nAdditionally, must have received Bürgergeld before.\n\nAlso, the User must be applying for this benefit (isEligibleFor the Einstiegsgeld), but the validation is to check if they are eligible, so the shape is triggered when the User is linked to this benefit via isEligibleFor. But since the target is always ff:User, the shape is for ff:User.\n\nWait the SHACL must be a shape that when applied to ff:User, validates if they meet the conditions. So the shape's target is ff:User, and the constraints are the above.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- A triple that the User has receivedBenefit linked to Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931).\n\n- AND (hasEmploymentStatus is SelfEmployed OR has an Employment where workHoursPerWeek >=15).\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nThe shape for the benefit's eligibility would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:Shape_Einstiegsgeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:or (\n            [\n                sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:SelfEmployed ;\n            ]\n            [\n                sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n        ) ;\n    ] .\n\nWait but the Employment has to be their new activity. The ontology might not differentiate between current and past employment, but since the condition is about the new activity, perhaps the user's current employment (via hasEmployment) is considered. \n\nAdditionally, the application must be submitted before starting the activity, but without a temporal property, we can't model that.\n\nThe other conditions like the benefit being required for integration can't be modeled.\n\nSo this is the main constraints. \n\nBut I need to ensure all terms are from the ontology. Bürgergeld is there, SelfEmployed is an EmploymentStatus, workHoursPerWeek is a DataProperty of Employment, yes.\n\nAlso, the benefit's target is the User node, which is correct.\n\nAnother point: the user must be applying for this benefit. But the SHACL shape is about eligibility, so the validation is on the User's data to see if they meet the criteria. The shape doesn't need to check the application submission timing or the evaluation by Jobcenter, which are not in the ontology.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL shape should look like that.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# Shape for validating eligibility for 'Einstiegsgeld' (B100019_LB_102716305)\n:Shape_Einstiegsgeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: Previously received Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931)\n        sh:path ff:receivedBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Requirement 5: Employment must be ≥15 hours/week OR self-employed\n        sh:or (\n            # Self-employed case\n            [\n                sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:SelfEmployed ;\n            ]\n            # Employed case with hours check\n            [\n                sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n        ) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Kinderzuschlag' (child supplement) social benefit based on the given conditions. The target node is ff:User. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the eligibility requirements again to make sure I understand all the conditions.\n\nThe conditions are:\n\n1. The child/children must be under 25, unmarried/unpartnered, and living in the user's household.\n2. The user must receive child benefit (Kindergeld) or equivalent for the child(ren).\n3. Income thresholds: \n   - Couples must have a combined gross income of at least €900/month (excluding housing and child benefits).\n   - Single parents need at least €600/month.\n4. The calculated income for the child supplement must not reduce it to zero.\n5. No significant assets.\n6. The user must be able to cover the family's needs with their income, child benefit, possible housing benefit, and the child supplement under SGB II.\n7. The child supplement is subordinate to other income sources for the child; must pursue priority claims like alimony.\n\nNow, translating these into SHACL constraints. Let's go step by step.\n\nStarting with the first condition: children's age, marital status, and household. \n\nThe user must have children linked via ff:hasChild. Each child must satisfy:\n- hasAge < 25 (but since it's under 25, maybe the data property would be ff:hasAge < 25)\n- Not married or in a civil partnership. So their marital status shouldn't be Married or CivilUnion. Since the ontology includes ff:MaritalStatus, we can check if their marital status is not one of those. Alternatively, maybe they have a marital status that's not Married or CivilUnion. Wait, the condition says \"not verheiratet oder verpartnert\" (not married or in a civil partnership). So the marital status should be something else, like Single, Widowed, etc. So for each child, their marital status must not be Married or CivilUnion. \n\nAlso, they must live in the same household as the user. The ontology has ff:sameHouseholdAs. So the child must be connected to the user via sameHouseholdAs? Or maybe the user is in the same household as the child. The property's domain is Person and range Person. So for each child, user ff:sameHouseholdAs child.\n\nWait, the property ff:sameHouseholdAs links two people in the same household. So for each child (c), User ff:sameHouseholdAs c.\n\nSo for the first condition, each child must have:\n\n- hasAge < 25\n- maritalStatus not in (Married, CivilUnion)\n- sameHouseholdAs User\n\nSo in SHACL, for the User node, we need to ensure that all children (ff:hasChild) have these properties. \n\nThis would involve a SHACL Shape for the children. So:\n\nFirst, the main shape for the User (ff:User) will have constraints on their children (ff:hasChild). So for each child in ff:hasChild, they must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nSo a shape for the children's node:\n\nShape for the children (targetClass: ff:Person, since they are individuals of Person):\n\nBut how to express this in SHACL? The User's hasChild must be objects that meet the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, use a SHACL path to traverse ff:hasChild and apply constraints.\n\nWait, the User must have children (ff:hasChild) where each child meets the conditions. So the User's hasChild must be a Person with the following properties.\n\nSo in SHACL, perhaps a shape for the User that requires that for all ?child in ff:hasChild, the child has those properties.\n\nAlternatively, using SHACL's property paths and constraints.\n\nFor example:\n\nA constraint on the User that for all children (ff:hasChild), they must have:\n\n- ff:hasAge < 25\n- ff:hasMaritalStatus not in (ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion)\n- ff:sameHouseholdAs the User (so the child has the user in their sameHouseholdAs)\n\nWait, but how do we express that the child's sameHouseholdAs includes the user?\n\nAlternatively, the User must be in the same household as each child. So for each child, the child has the User via sameHouseholdAs.\n\nSo for each child in ff:hasChild, the child must have a sameHouseholdAs relationship to the User.\n\nHmm, this might require a SHACL constraint that the path ff:hasChild/sameHouseholdAs includes the User. But how to express that in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a SHACL Node Shape for the children, and then requiring that the User's hasChild points to nodes that conform to that shape.\n\nSo first, define a shape for the children:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n:ChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;  # because children are instances of Person\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;  # since under 25, max is 24\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # Wait, no, sameHouseholdAs must include the User\n    ] .\n\nWait, but sameHouseholdAs is an object property. To ensure that the child has a sameHouseholdAs relationship to the User, the path ff:sameHouseholdAs must have at least one value equal to the User.\n\nSo:\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ; \n    ] .\n\nBut does SHACL allow sh:hasValue with a specific node? I think yes. So this would require that each child has at least one sameHouseholdAs link to the User.\n\nBut the User is the target node here. Since SHACL is validating the User, maybe the shape for the children is referenced via a SHACL constraint on the User's hasChild property.\n\nWait, the User must have at least one child (the condition says \"Ihr Kind/Ihre Kinder\" implies they have at least one), so perhaps the first thing is that the User must have at least one hasChild.\n\nWait, but the condition doesn't explicitly require having children, but the benefit is for children, so maybe it's implied. But maybe it's better to include that the User has at least one hasChild.\n\nSo first, the User must have ff:hasChild with at least one.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the User must have at least one child. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n] .\n\nThen, each of those children must conform to the :ChildShape.\n\nSo for the User's hasChild property, the values must be instances that conform to the :ChildShape.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done using sh:class (if the shape is a class?), but maybe using sh:node in the property constraint.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:nodeKind sh:IRI, but that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, use sh:node with the shape.\n\nWait, SHACL's property shape can have a sh:node constraint that points to a node shape. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # At least one child\n    sh:node [\n        sh:shape :ChildShape ;\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nThis way, each child in ff:hasChild must conform to :ChildShape.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nSecond condition: The user must receive Kindergeld or equivalent for the child(ren).\n\nThe user must have a ff:receivesChildBenefitFor relation to each child, or to some benefit equivalent to Kindergeld.\n\nLooking at the ontology, there's an individual: ff:B100019_LB_576986 (Kindergeld). The user must have ff:receivesChildBenefitFor each child, pointing to this or another equivalent benefit.\n\nThe condition says \"Kindergeld oder eine vergleichbare Leistung zum Beispiel aus dem Ausland\" (or comparable benefit from abroad).\n\nThe ontology has ff:SocialBenefit as a class. The user's ff:receivesChildBenefitFor must link to a SocialBenefit (could be Kindergeld or another).\n\nBut how to express that they must have at least one such for each child?\n\nWait, the user must have for each child a receivesChildBenefitFor that points to a SocialBenefit (which includes Kindergeld or others). \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a receivesChildBenefitFor for each child, and the target must be a SocialBenefit. Since the condition allows any equivalent benefit, maybe it's sufficient that the target is a SocialBenefit.\n\nSo the constraint is that for each child in ff:hasChild, there must exist a ff:receivesChildBenefitFor to a SocialBenefit.\n\nSo for the User:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # At least one child (assuming at least one child exists)\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path rdf:type ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:SocialBenefit ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:qualifiedValuesPath ff:hasChild ;  # The target of receivesChildBenefitFor must be the child\n] .\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for each child, the User must have a receivesChildBenefitFor to that child, with the benefit being a SocialBenefit.\n\nAlternatively, for each child in ff:hasChild, the user must have a receivesChildBenefitFor that points to that child. And the SocialBenefit is the object of that relation. Wait, the property ff:receivesChildBenefitFor has domain Person and range Person. Wait, looking back at the ontology:\n\nObjectProperty: ff:receivesChildBenefitFor\n    Annotations: rdfs:comment \"Links a person to a child for which they receive child benefit.\"@en\n    Domain: ff:Person\n    Range: ff:Person \n\nAh, so the ff:receivesChildBenefitFor links the user to the child, not to the benefit. That's a bit different. So the user must have a receivesChildBenefitFor relationship to each child for which they receive the benefit. But the actual benefit is separate.\n\nWait, the comment says: \"Links a person to a child for which they receive child benefit.\" So the user is linked to the child via this property, indicating that they receive child benefit for that child. The actual benefit (Kindergeld) is another node, perhaps connected via another property.\n\nHmm, but how does the user indicate they receive the benefit? Maybe the user has an ff:isEligibleFor or ff:receivesBenefit pointing to the Kindergeld social benefit. \n\nWait, looking at the ontology, there's ff:isEligibleFor and ff:receivesBenefit. The user must be receiving the child benefit (Kindergeld) or equivalent. The condition says \"Sie beziehen für Ihr Kind... Kindergeld oder eine vergleichbare Leistung\".\n\nSo the user must have a ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor a SocialBenefit (like Kindergeld or another) for each child. But the exact structure isn't clear from the ontology. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existence of the ff:receivesChildBenefitFor for the child implies they are receiving the benefit. But according to the ontology's definition of ff:receivesChildBenefitFor, it just links to the child, not the benefit itself. So perhaps the user must have a ff:receivesBenefit to a SocialBenefit (like Kindergeld), and that SocialBenefit is linked to the child somehow?\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Maybe the key point is that the user must have a receivesChildBenefitFor for each child, and that's sufficient to indicate they receive the benefit. Since the property's existence signifies that they receive it for the child. So the constraint is that for each child in hasChild, the user has a receivesChildBenefitFor to that child.\n\nSo the user must have, for each child in ff:hasChild, a ff:receivesChildBenefitFor to that child.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor all ?child in ff:hasChild, the user has ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ?child.\n\nTo express this in SHACL:\n\nThe User must have for each child in hasChild, a receivesChildBenefitFor to that child.\n\nThis can be done with a SHACL constraint on the User's receivesChildBenefitFor property, requiring that all children in hasChild are covered.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe set of children (ff:hasChild) must be a subset of the children for which they receive the benefit (ff:receivesChildBenefitFor).\n\nSo, the user's hasChild must be a subset of their receivesChildBenefitFor.\n\nIn SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # Assuming at least one child\n    sh:subset [\n        sh:propertyPath ff:hasChild ;\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nWait, subset is a constraint where the values of this property must be a subset of the values of another property path. So here, the receivesChildBenefitFor must be a subset of the hasChild. That is, the children for which they receive the benefit must be among their own children. Which makes sense.\n\nBut the requirement is the converse: all children must be in the receivesChildBenefitFor. So the hasChild must be a subset of the receivesChildBenefitFor. \n\nWait, the requirement is \"Sie beziehen für Ihr Kind/Ihre Kinder Kindergeld oder ...\", so for all their children (hasChild), they must have receivesChildBenefitFor them. So the hasChild must be a subset of the receivesChildBenefitFor. \n\nIn SHACL terms, the values of hasChild must be a subset of the values of receivesChildBenefitFor. \n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # At least one child\n    sh:subset [\n        sh:propertyPath ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nThis ensures that every child (hasChild) is also in the receivesChildBenefitFor list.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: For each child in hasChild, there must exist a receivesChildBenefitFor to that child. \n\nWhich can be done using a SHACL path constraint on the User's hasChild:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:each [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n            sh:hasValue ?child ;  # Wait, not sure.\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nHmm, maybe not straightforward. Perhaps using a SPARQL-based constraint, but the problem requires using SHACL Core only.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the receivesChildBenefitFor must have at least as many values as hasChild. But that's not precise.\n\nAlternatively, the count of hasChild must be less than or equal to the count of receivesChildBenefitFor. But that's not sufficient, since the actual children must be in both.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Maybe it's better to proceed and come back to this if time allows.\n\nMoving to the third condition: Income thresholds.\n\nThe user's family gross income must be at least €900 (if couple) or €600 (if single parent). \n\nFirst, we need to determine if the user is in a couple or a single parent.\n\nThe marital status is relevant here. If the user is married or in a civil union, they are considered a couple. Otherwise, a single parent.\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:MaritalStatus includes Married and CivilUnion as instances. \n\nSo, to determine the income threshold:\n\n- If marital status is Married or CivilUnion → couple → threshold is €900\n- Else → single → threshold is €600\n\nThe income to consider is the family gross income (familyGrossIncome) from the user's Income.\n\nThe data property ff:familyGrossIncome is part of the Income class, so the user must have an ff:hasIncome that has a familyGrossIncome >= the threshold.\n\nAdditionally, the income must exclude certain benefits like housing benefit (Wohngeld), child benefit (Kindergeld), and the child supplement itself (Kinderzuschlag).\n\nWait, the condition says \"ohne Wohngeld, Kindergeld und Kinderzuschlag\", so the gross income considered for the threshold is the family gross income excluding these. \n\nBut how is that represented in the ontology? The familyGrossIncome is part of the Income object, so perhaps the Income node already excludes those, or maybe there's another property. \n\nAssuming that the ff:familyGrossIncome property already represents the income excluding those benefits, then the constraint is straightforward.\n\nSo:\n\nThe user must have an Income (ff:hasIncome) with familyGrossIncome >= threshold, where the threshold depends on marital status.\n\nTo model this in SHACL:\n\nFirst, the user must have an income (ff:hasIncome).\n\nThen, the income must have a familyGrossIncome that meets the threshold.\n\nThe threshold is conditional on marital status.\n\nThis requires a SHACL constraint with a condition on marital status.\n\nIn SHACL Core, there's no if-else, but we can use sh:or with two conditions for each case.\n\nFirst, the user must have an income:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasIncome ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n] .\n\nThen, the income's familyGrossIncome must be >= threshold based on marital status.\n\nSo, two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Married or CivilUnion → familyGrossIncome >= 900\n\nCase 2: Else → familyGrossIncome >= 600\n\nIn SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasIncome ;\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValues [\n        sh:or (\n            [\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"900\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n            [\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"600\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:not [\n                        sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n                    ] ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n] .\n\nWait, but this structure might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nThe qualifiedValues would need to apply the conditions on the user's marital status and the income's familyGrossIncome.\n\nAlternatively, the qualifiedValuesPath would traverse from the user to their income, and then apply the constraints.\n\nWait, the path for the property is ff:hasIncome, so the target of the path is the Income node. \n\nThe marital status is a property of the User, not the Income. So to combine both, perhaps we need to use a SPARQL-based constraint, but since we must use SHACL Core, this complicates things.\n\nHmm, SHACL Core doesn't allow referencing properties from the target node (the User) within a qualifiedValues constraint. So this might not be possible with SHACL Core alone. \n\nAlternative approach: Use separate shapes for married and single users, but that might not fit into the SHACL structure here.\n\nAlternatively, separate constraints for marital status and income, but that won't enforce the dependency between them.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a limitation. Since the user must have either:\n\n(Married/CivilUnion AND income >=900) OR (not Married/CivilUnion AND income >=600)\n\nSo, we can model this with an sh:or constraint on the User's properties.\n\nFirst, the User must have an Income with familyGrossIncome >=900 AND marital status in (Married, CivilUnion), OR\n\nThe User must have an Income with familyGrossIncome >=600 AND marital status not in those.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:or (\n    [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"900\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        ] ;\n    ]\n    [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n            sh:not [\n                sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"600\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        ] ;\n    ]\n)\n\nThis way, the User must satisfy one of the two branches.\n\nThis seems feasible with SHACL Core.\n\nFourth condition: The calculated income for the child supplement must not reduce it to zero. \n\nThe exact wording: \"Ihr Einkommen, das auf den Kinderzuschlag angerechnet wird, ist nicht so hoch, dass sich der Kinderzuschlag auf null reduziert.\"\n\nThis likely means that after considering the user's income and other factors, the child supplement isn't completely offset. So there must be some remaining benefit.\n\nThe ontology has a property ff:reducesChildSupplementTo on the Income, which indicates the remaining amount after reduction.\n\nSo the user's Income must have a ff:reducesChildSupplementTo greater than zero.\n\nThus, the constraint is:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ;\n    sh:minInclusive \"0.01\"^^xsd:decimal ;  # Must be >0\n] .\n\nFifth condition: No significant assets. \n\nThe ontology has a data property ff:hasConsiderableAssets (boolean). This must be false.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n    sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n] .\n\nSixth condition: The user can cover the family's needs with income, child benefit, housing benefit, and child supplement.\n\nThe condition states that the user must be able to cover the family's needs with their income, Kindergeld, possible Wohngeld, and the child supplement under SGB II. \n\nThe ontology has a data property ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit (boolean) which must be true.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n] .\n\nSeventh condition: The child supplement is subordinate to other income sources for the child. Must pursue priority claims like alimony.\n\nThis means the user must not have priority claims over this benefit. The ontology has a property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, which links the user to the SocialBenefit (Kinderzuschlag here).\n\nThe SocialBenefit instance for Kinderzuschlag is ff:B100019_LB_581863.\n\nThus, the user must have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to this benefit.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n] .\n\nNow, putting all these together into the SHACL shape for ff:User.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that all required properties are present.\n\nLet me structure the SHACL step by step:\n\nFirst, the base shape for ff:User.\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:KinderzuschlagShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # Target is the User node\n    sh:property [\n        # Children conditions\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;  # Must have at least one child\n        sh:node [\n            sh:shape :ChildShape ;  # Each child must conform to ChildShape\n        ] ;\n    ],\n    [  # Condition on receivesChildBenefitFor and hasChild\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:subset [\n            sh:propertyPath ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;  # All children must be in receivesChildBenefitFor\n        ] ;\n    ],\n    [  # Income thresholds condition (married/couple vs single)\n        sh:or (\n            [  # Married/CivilUnion and income >=900\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"900\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n            [  # Not Married/CivilUnion and income >=600\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:not [\n                        sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n                    ] ;\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"600\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n        )\n    ],\n    [  # ReducesChildSupplementTo must be >0\n        sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"0.01\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ],\n    [  # No considerable assets\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ],\n    [  # Can cover family needs\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ],\n    [  # Has no priority claims over Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ]\n.\n\n# ChildShape definition\n:ChildShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;  # Children are instances of Person\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;  # Under 25 years\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;  # Not married or civil union\n        ] ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;  # Must live in same household as User\n    ]\n.\n\nWait, but in the ChildShape, the sameHouseholdAs must include the User. The path ff:sameHouseholdAs must have at least one value equal to ff:User. So using sh:hasValue with ff:User in the property constraint for sameHouseholdAs should enforce that.\n\nThis should cover all conditions except perhaps the receivesChildBenefitFor subset part. Let me check that again.\n\nThe subset constraint ensures that all children (hasChild) are included in the receivesChildBenefitFor list. So that's covered.\n\nNow, verifying each condition:\n\n1. Children's age, marital status, household: covered by :ChildShape.\n\n2. Receiving Kindergeld or equivalent for each child: the subset constraint ensures that all children are in receivesChildBenefitFor, which implies the user receives the benefit for them.\n\n3. Income thresholds: handled via the or condition.\n\n4. ReducesChildSupplementTo >0: yes.\n\n5. No considerable assets: yes.\n\n6. Can cover family needs: yes.\n\n7. No priority claims: yes.\n\nThis seems to cover all the conditions. Now, need to ensure all SHACL is syntactically correct.\n\nAlso, check that all properties are from the ontology. For example, ff:reducesChildSupplementTo is present in the data properties.\n\nYes, the ontology has:\n\nDataProperty: ff:reducesChildSupplementTo\n    Annotations: rdfs:comment \"An applicant's income is offset against child supplement to varying degrees. This property links an income to the amount of child supplement remaining after any income-related reductions are taken into account.\"@en\n    Domain: ff:Income\n    Range: xsd:decimal \n\nYes, so the path ff:hasIncome/ff:reducesChildSupplementTo is valid.\n\nAlso, the marital status properties are correct.\n\nAnother thing: the income thresholds require that the user has an Income. The first property in the shape ensures that hasIncome has minCount 1 (due to the first property with ff:hasChild and node constraint, but actually the income part is covered in the or condition. Wait, no, the income is required in the or condition's branches, but to be safe, perhaps add a separate constraint that the user has an Income.\n\nWait, in the current setup, the or condition includes checks on ff:hasIncome, so if the user has no income, then the or branches would fail. So maybe that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, to explicitly require an Income:\n\nAdd:\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasIncome ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ]\n\nBut since the or condition already requires that the user has an Income (as part of the path), maybe it's redundant. But including it might make it clearer.\n\nSimilarly for the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, it needs to have at least one such link.\n\nAlso, the User must not have other conflicting benefits, but the conditions don't mention that except the seventh point which is about priority claims.\n\nI think this covers everything.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:KinderzuschlagShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # Target the User node\n    sh:property [\n        # Ensure children meet eligibility criteria\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;  # At least one child required\n        sh:node [  # Each child must conform to :ChildShape\n            sh:shape :ChildShape ;\n        ] ;\n    ],\n    [  # All children must be covered by receivesChildBenefitFor\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:subset [  # Children must be in receivesChildBenefitFor\n            sh:propertyPath ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        ] ;\n    ],\n    [  # Income thresholds based on marital status\n        sh:or (\n            [  # Married/CivilUnion with familyGrossIncome ≥ 900\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"900\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n            [  # Single with familyGrossIncome ≥ 600\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n                    sh:not [\n                        sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n                    ] ;\n                ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n                    sh:minInclusive \"600\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n                ] ;\n            ]\n        )\n    ],\n    [  # Child supplement reduction must leave a positive amount\n        sh:path ff:hasIncome/ff:reducesChildSupplementTo ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"0.01\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ],\n    [  # No considerable assets\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ],\n    [  # Can cover family needs with combined resources\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ],\n    [  # No priority claims over Kinderzuschlag\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ]\n.\n\n# Shape for validating children\n:ChildShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:Person ;  # Targets child nodes (instances of Person)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;  # Child must be under 25\n        sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:int ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;  # Not married or in civil partnership\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ] ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;  # Must live in same household as User\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n    ]\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the Bürgergeld (Citizen's Benefit) with the ID B100019_LB_106311931. Let me start by breaking down the requirements provided in the text.\n\nFirst, the eligibility criteria mentioned are:\n\n1. **Erwerbsfähig (Employable):**\n   - At least 3 hours of work per day possible.\n   - At least 15 years old and not yet reached the retirement age (67 for those born after 1963; check §7a SGB II for earlier births).\n   \n2. **Hilfebedürftig (Needy):**\n   - Cannot cover own essential living expenses and those of non-employable relatives in the benefit unit with own means (income, assets) or efforts (work) plus priority benefits like unemployment benefit, housing benefit, child supplement.\n\n3. **No prior claims over other benefits/persons:**\n   - Must not have priority claims over other benefits (e.g., housing benefit) or other people (like former spouses, parents of the child).\n\n4. **Residing in Germany:**\n   - Must live in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nNow, I need to map these requirements to the ontology provided. Let's go through each point.\n\n**1. Erwerbsfähig (Employable):**\n   - The ontology has ff:availableForPlacement (xsd:boolean) which might relate to availability for work. But the requirement specifies hours per day. There's ff:employableHoursPerDay (xsd:decimal). So we need to ensure that the user has this property with a value ≥3.\n   - Age must be at least 15 years. Use ff:hasAge (xsd:int) ≥15.\n   - Not reached retirement age. The retirement age is a bit tricky because it depends on birth year. The ontology has ff:isPensionable (xsd:boolean). So the user must NOT be pensionable (i.e., isPensionable is false). But the text mentions that if born after 1963, it's 67. However, since SHACL can't compute birth year from age, maybe the age must be less than the retirement age. But without the exact birth year, perhaps the ontology expects a direct boolean flag. Since the ontology has ff:isPensionable, we can use that. The condition would be that the person's isPensionable is false.\n\n**2. Hilfebedürftig (Needy):**\n   - The requirement is that they can't cover their own and their benefit unit's needs with their own means and priority benefits. The ontology has a data property ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit (xsd:boolean). This should be false. So the condition is that this property is false.\n\n**3. No prior claims:**\n   - The user must not have priority claims over other benefits or persons. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links a person to a social benefit if they don't have priority claims over it. Since the benefit here is Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931), the user must have this property pointing to the Bürgergeld. Wait, but the condition says they must NOT have such claims over other benefits. Alternatively, maybe the requirement is that the user does NOT have any other priority benefits that would supersede the Bürgergeld. The ontology might require the user to have a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver relation to the Bürgergeld, meaning they don't have claims over others. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not have any other benefits that have priority. Since the exact modeling is tricky, the ontology's hasNoPriorityClaimsOver might be the way to go. So, the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to the Bürgergeld itself? Or maybe to other benefits? The description says \"keine vorrangigen Ansprüche gegenüber anderen Leistungsträgern\" – so the user must not have priority claims over other benefit providers. To model this, perhaps the user must have a statement that they have no such claims, which would be a boolean? Wait, the property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is an object property, so the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to the Bürgergeld. Alternatively, maybe the user must not be linked to any other social benefits via hasNoPriorityClaimsOver? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The ontology's description says \"Links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So, perhaps the user must have a link to the Bürgergeld indicating they have no priority claims over it. Therefore, the condition would be that the user has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver the Bürgergeld. So in SHACL, this would be a property path that requires that the user has at least one such object with the target being the Bürgergeld instance.\n\n**4. Living in Germany:**\n   - The user must be residing in Germany. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence (object property to Country). So the user's ff:countryOfResidence must be Germany (ff:Germany). \n\nNow, checking the ontology for the correct properties and classes:\n\n- The SocialBenefit instance for Bürgergeld is B100019_LB_106311931.\n\nSo the SHACL shape should target ff:User, and have the following constraints:\n\n1. For Erwerbsfähig:\n   - hasAge ≥15\n   - employableHoursPerDay ≥3\n   - isPensionable is false (so value must be false, i.e., the user is not pensionable)\n\n2. Hilfebedürftig:\n   - canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false (so the value is false)\n\n3. No priority claims:\n   - must have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to the Bürgergeld instance (B100019_LB_106311931). So the path is ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver and the value must be that instance. So the shape requires that the user has at least one such object which is exactly that benefit.\n\n4. Residing in Germany:\n   - countryOfResidence must be equal to ff:Germany.\n\nAdditionally, all these conditions must be met, so the SHACL shape will have these as mandatory properties with the appropriate constraints.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL in Turtle:\n\nThe shapes graph should define a shape for ff:User, using SHACL's core components.\n\nFirst, define the shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#>.\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#>.\n\n:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:int ;\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n    sh:minInclusive \"3\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:isPensionable ;\n    sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n    sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:SocialBenefit ;  # Ensure it points to a SocialBenefit\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;  # Must include this benefit\n  ], [\n    sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Germany ;\n  ] .\n\nWait, but for the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, the condition is that the user must not have priority claims over other benefits. The description says \"hasNoPriorityClaimsOver links a person to a social benefit if they are not eligible for other benefits with priority over this one.\" So if the user has a hasNoPriorityClaimsOver link to the Bürgergeld, that would mean that they don't have priority claims over Bürgergeld, but perhaps it's the other way around. Alternatively, maybe the user must not have any other benefits that have priority over Bürgergeld, so they must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver to the Bürgergeld. Alternatively, maybe the condition is that the user does not have any priority claims over other benefits, so they must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver for all relevant benefits, but since we can't model that in SHACL for all, perhaps the requirement is that for the Bürgergeld, the user has this property, ensuring that they don't have priority claims over it. So the user must have an assertion that they have no priority claims over the Bürgergeld. Hence, the shape requires that the user has at least one hasNoPriorityClaimsOver to the Bürgergeld. So the hasValue is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must not have any other benefits that have priority, which would require that the user does not have any such claims, but in SHACL it's easier to model that they have an explicit link to the Bürgergeld indicating no priority claims. The ontology's definition says that the property links a person to a social benefit if they don't have priority claims over that benefit, so to be eligible for Bürgergeld, the user must have this property pointing to it. Hence, the hasValue is correct.\n\nNow, checking all constraints:\n\n- All properties are from the ontology.\n- Using SHACL Core components: sh:hasValue, sh:minInclusive, sh:minCount, etc.\n- Target is ff:User.\n- The countryOfResidence must be Germany.\n\nThus, the Turtle should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  # 1.

behinderte Menschen durchgeführt wird,\n  * Sie Ihre Ausbildung verlängern müssen,\n  * Sie die Ausbildung aufgrund Ihrer Behinderung ganz oder teilweise wiederholen und eine dauerhafte Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben sonst nicht möglich wäre oder\n  * Sie im Haushalt der Eltern oder eines Elternteils wohnen.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzung bei berufsvorbereitenden Bildungsmaßnahmen:\n\n  * Die berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme wird im Auftrag der Agentur für Arbeit durchgeführt\n\nEine Ausbildung oder berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme im Ausland ist wie\nfolgt förderfähig:\n\n  * bei teilweiser Ausbildung im Ausland, wenn \n    * der Teil der Ausbildung im Ausland nicht länger als 1 Jahr dauert und\n    * der Teil der Ausbildung im Ausland im Hinblick auf die Gesamtdauer der Ausbildung als angemessen erscheint\n  * bei vollständiger Ausbildung im Ausland, \n    * wenn die Ausbildung im Ausland dem Berufsziel des Antragstellers besonders dienlich ist und\n    * amtlich bestätigt wird, dass die Ausbildung im Ausland einer betrieblichen Ausbildung in Deutschland gleichgestellt ist\n  * bei teilweise im Ausland stattfindender berufsvorbereitender Bildungsmaßname, wenn \n    * der Teil im Ausland die Hälfte der vorgesehenen Förderdauer nicht übersteigt und\n    * der Teil im Ausland im Hinblick auf die Gesamtdauer der Maßnahme als angemessen erscheint.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' benefit. First, I need to parse the given conditions and map them to the ontology provided. The target node is ff:User, so all shapes should start with a targetClass of ff:User.\n\nStarting with the eligibility criteria for the person:\n\n1. The user must not be living with their parents during the training, and the training company is too far from the parental home, OR they are at least 18, married, or have a child living with them. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the property ff:parentalAdress might be relevant. The condition about the address being too far can be checked using the data property ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany on the address. So, for the first part, the user must either have an address linked via ff:parentalAdress where ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany is true, or they meet one of the age, marital status, or having a child conditions.\n\nAge check uses ff:hasAge ≥ 18. Marital status being Married or CivilUnion (since \"verheiratet\" includes civil partners?), so ff:hasMaritalStatus must be one of those instances. Having a child would use ff:hasChild linked to a person, and maybe check if they live together with ff:sameHouseholdAs, but the text just says \"have at least one child living with them.\" So maybe just the existence of a child via ff:hasChild suffices, assuming the child is in the household.\n\nNext, residence status conditions: if not German, they can't have an Asylum Act permit (ff:hasAsylumActPermit = true) and must not be tolerated with less than 15 months (ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months = true). So for non-Germans (ff:isNationalOf not Germany), these two properties must be false.\n\nFinancial inability to cover costs: need to check if they can't cover the listed expenses. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit or ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds? The text says they can't cover the required expenses, so these properties should be false. Need to ensure that at least one of the costs (like Lebensunterhalt) is not covered. But the exact property here might be a bit ambiguous. Maybe the ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is the right one here, as it relates to covering basic needs. Alternatively, perhaps the data properties related to income are needed here. Wait, the user must not be able to cover the costs, so maybe ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false. Alternatively, the user's income is insufficient. The text mentions \"erforderlichen Mittel aufbringen\", so maybe the ff:hasConsiderableAssets is false? Hmm, the ontology has ff:hasConsiderableAssets, which is true if they have considerable assets. So to not be able to cover the costs, that would be false. But the exact mapping here needs to be precise. Alternatively, maybe the ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is false? Let me check the ontology again. The description for ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is \"True if a person can cover their personal basic needs with their income, assets, and priority benefits, false otherwise.\" So if that's false, then they can't cover it, which matches the requirement. So that's the property to use here.\n\nNow for the training conditions:\n\nFirst, it's their first vocational training (ff:isFirstVocationalTraining = true) OR if not first, they can't be integrated into the workforce otherwise (maybe via ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause linked to a disability?). But the exact condition is \"können nicht auf andere Weise dauerhaft beruflich eingegliedert werden\" which might relate to a disability that reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently). Alternatively, perhaps there's a property indicating that they need support because of a disability. Alternatively, maybe the 'workforceIntegrationProblemBecause' property points to a Disability that has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. So if the training is not the first, then there must be a Disability linked via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause with that property set. Hmm, but how to model that in SHACL? Maybe through a nested shape.\n\nThe training must be recognized by law (ff:recognizedByLaw must be one of the legal codes like VocationalTrainingAct, CraftsCode, MaritimeLabourAct, or NursingProfessionsAct's Part 2). Also, they must have a VocationalTrainingContract via ff:subjectToContract.\n\nFor disability cases: If they have a disability (ff:hasDisability = true), then the training can be in a special form (maybe linked via some property?), but the exact ontology terms are a bit unclear. The conditions allow them to get the benefit even if they are living with parents if the training is adapted for their disability. So if they have a disability, then either the training is in a special form (maybe via ff:ruleExemptionBecause linked to the disability?) or they need to repeat the training due to disability, etc. This might be complex. Maybe for the SHACL, it's better to model that if they have a disability, then certain other conditions must be met. Alternatively, the presence of a disability allows some exceptions, but the main conditions still need to be checked. This part might require more precise ontology properties, but given the constraints, perhaps it's better to model the disability-related conditions as optional shapes.\n\nFor the vocational preparation measures (berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme), they must be commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true).\n\nFor the abroad conditions:\n\n- Partly abroad: duration ≤ 1 year (ff:monthsAbroad ≤ 12) and appropriate in relation to total duration (maybe ff:percentAbroad is ≤ some threshold? The text says \"als angemessen erscheint\" which is subjective, so perhaps this can't be modeled and is excluded as per the rules).\n\n- Fully abroad: must be beneficial to the career goal (not sure how to model) and equivalence confirmed by authorities (maybe via a property like ff:recognizedByLaw with a specific legal code? Not sure).\n\n- Vocational preparation abroad: part not exceeding half the duration (ff:percentAbroad ≤ 50%? Or ff:monthsAbroad ≤ half of total duration).\n\nSince some conditions are subjective (like \"angemessen\"), those are excluded as per instructions.\n\nPutting this all together, I need to create SHACL shapes with constraints for each of these conditions, using the ontology properties.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL:\n\nStart with a base shape for the User, then break into components for each major condition.\n\nFor the person's eligibility:\n\nShape for the living situation and age/marital status/children.\n\nShape for residence status.\n\nShape for financial inability.\n\nTraining conditions: first or needing it due to disability.\n\nTraining recognition and contract.\n\nDisability cases.\n\nAbroad conditions.\n\nAlso, ensure that the benefit being checked is the correct one (B100019_LB_574724).\n\nBut the SHACL shapes should validate whether the user meets all the criteria, so the shapes need to enforce all these constraints through SHACL's core components like sh:property, sh:or, sh:and, sh:closed, etc.\n\nI think it's getting a bit complex, but let's proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n######################################################################\n### Shape for User Eligibility for 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe'\n######################################################################\n\n### Main Shape Targeting ff:User\n:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path rdf:type ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:Person ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_574724 ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:and (\n    :PersonEligibility\n    :TrainingEligibility\n    :DisabilityConditions\n    :AbroadConditions\n  ) .\n\n######################################################################\n### Person Eligibility Constraints\n######################################################################\n\n:PersonEligibility\n  a sh:PropertyShape ;\n  sh:path rdf:type ;\n  sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:property :LivingSituationOrAgeConditions ]\n    [ sh:property :ResidenceConditions ]\n    [ sh:property :FinancialConditions ]\n  ) .\n\n### Living Situation and Age/Marital Status/Children\n:LivingSituationOrAgeConditions\n  a sh:PropertyShape ;\n  sh:path rdf:type ;

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the eligibility of the 'Kindergeld' (Child Benefit) with IDLB B100019_LB_576986. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the provided text and the ontology.\n\nFirst, the conditions for the parents:\n\n1. **Tax Liability**: The parent must be subject to unlimited income tax in Germany or treated as such. This applies to EU, EEA, or Swiss nationals even without a domestic residence. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the property ff:incomeTaxLiability links to TaxLiabilityScope. The individual ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability is the one needed here. So I need a SHACL constraint that checks if the User has this property.\n\n2. **Additional conditions for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens arriving after August 2019**:\n   - After 4 months, they must meet the Freedom of Movement Act requirements. \n   - They must be self-employed, employed, job-seeking, or involuntarily unemployed.\n   - Derive freedom of movement from a family member.\n   - Have sufficient means and health insurance, or have permanent residence.\n\nFor the EU citizens, I need to check if they are in the EEAplusCH country class. Also, after 4 months (ff:lessThanFourMonthsAgo?), but the exact property for the duration since moving might be tricky. The ff:moveToGermany event might be relevant, but I need to see if the ontology has properties for the duration. The property ff:lessThanFourMonthsAgo on an event (like moving) could be used here. But I need to link that.\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:MoveToGermany as a subclass of Event. So perhaps the user has a ff:hasEvent linked to a MoveToGermany instance, and that event's ff:hasDate should be checked for being over 4 months ago. But SHACL can't do date calculations, so maybe they have a data property like ff:monthsWithinLast3Years or similar. Alternatively, maybe the user has ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months? Not sure. Maybe the text's 4 months is handled by a boolean like ff:lessThanFourMonthsAgo on the MoveToGermany event. Hmm, the ontology doesn't have that exactly. Alternatively, maybe the requirements are modeled via other properties.\n\nAlternatively, for the Freedom of Movement eligibility, the user must have either:\n\n- ff:adequateHealthInsurance (true)\n- ff:permanentRightOfResidence (true)\n- Derive freedom via a family member (ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom someone else who qualifies)\n- Employment status (ff:EmploymentStatus like Employee or SelfEmployed, or JobSeeker?)\n\nBut the SHACL can't express all these conditions in a single shape. Maybe we need to model the conditions as AND and OR constraints.\n\nWait, the problem says to use only SHACL Core. So I need to structure this with SHACL's AND and OR components. Let's break down each part.\n\nFor EU/EEA/Swiss citizens arriving after August 2019:\n\n- After 4 months (so if the move happened more than 4 months ago?), but how to express that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't compute dates, perhaps the user has a property indicating that the stay is beyond 4 months. Alternatively, the text says \"ab dem 4. Monat\" so after that period, the conditions must be met. But maybe in the data, there's a flag like ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months which might not be exactly 4, but perhaps the user must have a residence status that satisfies the time? Not sure. Maybe the problem expects us to model the presence of the necessary properties without the time check, since it's ambiguous. The strict rule says not to model ambiguous requirements. Hmm. Maybe we can ignore the 4-month timing since it's unclear how to represent it, and focus on the other conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the 4-month condition is part of the eligibility after that period, so perhaps the user must have:\n\n- ff:hasResidenceStatus that meets the requirements, but I don't see that in the ontology. Alternatively, the user must have ff:countryOfResidence Germany and meet the other criteria.\n\nBut the main point is that for EU/EEA/Swiss, they need to have one of the following:\n\n- Self-employed or employed (ff:EmploymentStatus is Employee or SelfEmployed)\n- Job-seeking (ff:EmploymentStatus is JobSeeker or RegisteredUnemployed?)\n- Deriving freedom from a family member (ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom another person who qualifies)\n- Sufficient means (ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence is true)\n- Health insurance (ff:adequateHealthInsurance is true)\n- Permanent residence (ff:permanentRightOfResidence is true)\n\nWait, the text says: \"sind freizügigkeitsberechtigt, wenn sie ...\". So the user must have at least one of those conditions. So in SHACL, this would be a OR constraint between these properties.\n\nBut how to express that? Since SHACL Core doesn't have OR, maybe we need to use OR in the shape's constraints. For example, using sh:or with multiple sh:Constraint components.\n\nAlso, the user must be a citizen of EU/EEA/Switzerland (ff:isNationalOf an EEAplusCH country). So:\n\nFirst, check if the user is from EEAplusCH or another group (non-EEA with residence permit, or recognized refugee).\n\nThe first condition for parents:\n\nEither:\n\n- They are EU/EEA/Swiss and meet the sub-conditions, OR\n\n- They are non-EU but have a residence permit allowing work (ff:hasResidencePermit with ff:entitlesToEmployment true), OR\n\n- Recognized refugee/asylee (ff:recognizedRefugee or ff:entitledToAsylum is true).\n\nNow, for the child's conditions:\n\n- Child's residence in Germany, EU/EEA, or Switzerland (ff:countryOfResidence must be one of these). But the ontology has ff:countryOfResidence for Person, so the child must have that.\n\nAlternatively, the child's residence is in Germany or another EEAplusCH country. So the child's countryOfResidence must be in EEAplusCH or Germany.\n\nWait the text says \"Wohnsitz oder gewöhnlichen Aufenthalt in Deutschland oder in einem anderen EU/EEA-Staat/Schweiz.\"\n\nSo, the child's countryOfResidence must be in Germany or EEAplusCH.\n\nAdditionally, even if the child is in EU/EEA/Switzerland but the parent has unlimited tax in Germany, then they still qualify. So the parent's tax status is also a condition here.\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL shape must target the User (ff:User), and check the following:\n\n1. The parent (User) must have:\n\n   a. Either:\n\n      i. (EU/EEA/Swiss citizen):\n\n         - ff:isNationalOf a country in EEAplusCH,\n\n         AND\n\n         (if moved to Germany after August 2019, but maybe that's too detailed),\n\n         AND\n\n         meet the Freedom of Movement conditions (one of the below):\n\n             - employed/self-employed,\n\n             - job-seeking,\n\n             - derive from family member,\n\n             - sufficient means,\n\n             - health insurance,\n\n             - permanent residence.\n\n         But SHACL can't express conditional logic based on moving date. So maybe just check that they have at least one of those conditions.\n\n      ii. OR non-EU citizen with residence permit allowing work (ff:hasResidencePermit with ff:entitlesToEmployment true),\n\n      iii. OR recognized refugee (ff:recognizedRefugee is true),\n\n      iv. OR entitled to asylum (ff:entitledToAsylum is true).\n\n   b. OR the parent's income tax is unlimited in Germany (ff:incomeTaxLiability is ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability).\n\n2. The child must have:\n\n   a. Country of residence in Germany or EEAplusCH (ff:countryOfResidence in those countries).\n\n   OR\n\n   b. Even if the child is elsewhere, but parent has unlimited tax in Germany (so the parent's tax condition must also be met).\n\nBut how to model OR between the child's residence and the parent's tax?\n\nThe problem says \"Eventuell haben Sie auch dann Anspruch...\" so it's an alternative scenario where the child's residence isn't in Germany but the parent's tax is. So the overall condition is:\n\n(Child's residence is Germany/EEA/Swiss) OR (Parent has unlimited tax in Germany AND child's residence is in EU/EEA/Switzerland).\n\nWait, the text says \"Ihr Kind zwar in einem Haushalt in der EU, EWR oder der Schweiz lebt, beispielsweise Sie oder der andere Elternteil aber in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig ist...\"\n\nSo the child can be in EU/EEA/Switzerland, and the parent must have the unlimited tax in Germany. So the child's country must be in the EU/EEA/Switzerland, and the parent's tax is unlimited.\n\nSo for the child's conditions, the OR is between:\n\n- (child's country is Germany/EEA/Swiss),\n\nOR\n\n- (child's country is EU/EEA/Switzerland AND parent has unlimited tax in Germany).\n\nBut how to model that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't express complex OR conditions across different resources (the child is a separate person linked via ff:hasChild?), but the User (parent) must have a child with certain conditions.\n\nWait, the User (parent) must have a child (via ff:hasChild) where:\n\nEither:\n\n1. The child's countryOfResidence is Germany or EEAplusCH,\n\nOR\n\n2. The child's countryOfResidence is in EU/EEA/Switzerland AND the parent has ff:incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nBut in SHACL, to express that, we need to model a path to the child's countryOfResidence and the parent's tax. But SHACL shapes can't easily reference other nodes. So perhaps we need to create a shape for the child and link it via sh:property with a path that navigates to the child's country.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the User must have a child that satisfies either of the two conditions. Since SHACL can't do nested ORs easily, maybe break it into two separate constraints with sh:or.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the parent's eligibility:\n\nThe User (parent) must satisfy at least one of the following:\n\n- EU/EEA/Swiss citizen and meets the FoM conditions,\n\n- Non-EU with work permit,\n\n- Refugee/asylee,\n\nOR the User's tax is unlimited in Germany (regardless of nationality).\n\nWait the first condition is \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatsangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz.\"\n\nSo the first main condition is that the parent has unlimited tax liability (ff:incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability).\n\nAdditionally, for EU citizens arriving after August 2019, they need to meet the FoM conditions (but since we can't track arrival date, maybe that's considered part of the 'permanent residence' or other flags).\n\nBut the problem says to not model ambiguous requirements. Since the 4-month timing might be ambiguous, maybe we can ignore that and just require the FoM conditions (sufficient means, health insurance, etc.) for EU citizens who are in Germany but not nationals.\n\nAlternatively, the main point for EU citizens is that they must have one of the listed statuses (employed, job-seeking, deriving rights, etc.) if they are from EU/EEA/Switzerland.\n\nWait, the first part says \"Sie sind in Deutschland unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig oder werden so veranlagt. Dies gilt auch für Staatsangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz.\"\n\nSo the tax condition is the primary, and even EU citizens qualify under that. The second bullet adds extra conditions for those arriving after August 2019, but perhaps in SHACL, we can ignore the arrival timing and focus on the FoM requirements as part of their eligibility.\n\nAlternatively, the first condition (tax) covers EU citizens, and the second bullet adds more conditions for those who moved after 2019, but since it's unclear how to model that, maybe the main thing is that they must have either:\n\n- The tax condition,\n\nOR\n\n- For EU citizens not meeting tax, they must meet the FoM conditions.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Maybe proceed with the following constraints:\n\nFor the User (parent):\n\n1. Must have income tax liability as ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability (since that's the primary condition).\n\nOR\n\n2. If not, then the user must be a EU/EEA/Swiss citizen (ff:isNationalOf EEAplusCH) and satisfy at least one of the FoM conditions (employed, etc.).\n\nOR\n\n3. Or have a residence permit that allows work, or be refugee/asylee.\n\nWait, the structure is:\n\nThe User must have either:\n\n- ff:incomeTaxLiability = UnlimitedTaxLiability,\n\nOR\n\n- (is from EEAplusCH and meets FoM conditions),\n\nOR\n\n- (non-EEA and has a valid residence permit or refugee status).\n\nBut how to structure this in SHACL?\n\nMaybe using sh:or with multiple sh:Constraint components.\n\nNow, putting this into SHACL:\n\nStart with the main shape for ff:User.\n\nFirst, the tax condition:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability;\n].\n\nOR\n\nThen the other conditions for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens:\n\nsh:or ( ... )\n\nBut this requires grouping with sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:or with multiple alternatives.\n\nThe overall shape would have:\n\nsh:or (\n  [sh:property [sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability; sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability;]],\n  [sh:and (\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:isNationalOf; sh:hasValue [sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH];]],\n    [sh:or (\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus; sh:hasValue [sh:instanceOf [sh:subclassOf ff:Employee, ff:SelfEmployed];]]],\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus; sh:hasValue ff:JobSeeker]],\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom; sh:minCount 1;]],\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]],\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]],\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]]\n    )]\n  )],\n  [sh:or (\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit; sh:hasValue [sh:property [sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]]]],\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]],\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]]\n  )]\n).\n\nHmm, but this is getting very nested and may not be valid SHACL Core. Since SHACL Core's sh:or and sh:and can only take a list of constraints, maybe each alternative in sh:or must be a shape with its own constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conditions are too complex, and I should simplify.\n\nAlternatively, break into separate shapes.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the User must satisfy at least one of the following three conditions:\n\n1. Tax condition: has ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\n2. EU/EEA/Swiss citizen and meets the FoM conditions (has at least one of the listed statuses).\n\n3. Non-EU with valid residence permit or refugee/asylee.\n\nSo the shape for the User would have:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n  [sh:property [sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability; sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability;]],\n\n  [sh:and (\n\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:isNationalOf; sh:hasValue [sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH];]],\n\n    [sh:or ( \n\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus; sh:hasValue [sh:instanceOf [sh:subclassOf ff:Employee, ff:SelfEmployed];]]],\n\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus; sh:hasValue ff:JobSeeker]],\n\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom; sh:minCount 1;]],\n\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]],\n\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]],\n\n      [sh:property [sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]]\n\n    )]\n\n  )],\n\n  [sh:or (\n\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit; sh:hasValue [sh:property [sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]]]],\n\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]],\n\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;]]\n\n  )]\n\n)\n\nBut SHACL's sh:or and sh:and require that the elements are shapes. So each part must be a valid shape expression.\n\nNow, moving on to the child's conditions.\n\nThe User must have a child (ff:hasChild) that satisfies:\n\nEither:\n\n- Child's countryOfResidence is in Germany (ff:Germany) or EEAplusCH,\n\nOR\n\n- The child's countryOfResidence is in EEAplusCH AND the User has the unlimited tax liability (which is already checked in the parent's conditions).\n\nWait, the second part requires the child's country to be EU/EEA/Switzerland and the parent's tax is unlimited. Since the parent's tax condition is already a separate check, maybe in the child's condition, the second option is just that the child's country is in EU/EEA/Switzerland, and the parent's tax condition is met.\n\nBut in SHACL, how to express that the User has a child where (child's country is Germany/EEA OR (child's country is EEA and User's tax is unlimited)).\n\nAlternatively, since the tax condition is part of the parent's eligibility, perhaps the child's condition is:\n\nThe User has a child where the child's countryOfResidence is either Germany or EEAplusCH, OR the child's country is EEAplusCH and the parent's tax is unlimited.\n\nBut this is a nested condition. Since SHACL can't directly express that, perhaps it's better to split into two separate checks:\n\n1. The child must be in Germany/EEA/Switzerland, or\n\n2. The child must be in EEA/Switzerland and the parent has unlimited tax.\n\nTo model this, we can use sh:or for the child's country, and for the second part, use a shape that combines both the child's country and the parent's tax.\n\nBut SHACL can't reference the parent's properties in the child's shape easily. So perhaps the best way is:\n\nThe User must have a child where:\n\nEither:\n\n- The child's countryOfResidence is Germany or in EEAplusCH.\n\nOR\n\n- The child's countryOfResidence is in EEAplusCH AND the User has ff:incomeTaxLiability = ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\nTo model this, we can use a sh:property with a path to the child's country and an additional condition on the User's tax.\n\nThis would require using sh:and in a nested way.\n\nThe shape for the User would include:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasChild;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:sparql [\n    sh:prefix \"PREFIX ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> \";\n    sh:ask \"\"\"\n      ASK WHERE {\n        ?child ff:countryOfResidence ?country .\n        FILTER ( \n          ( ?country = ff:Germany || ?country a ff:EEAplusCH ) \n          || \n          ( ?country a ff:EEAplusCH && ?user ff:incomeTaxLiability ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability )\n        )\n      }\n    \"\"\"\n  ]\n].\n\nBut SHACL Core doesn't support SPARQL constraints, only Core components. So this approach won't work.\n\nAlternative approach without SPARQL:\n\nThe first part is straightforward: the child must have countryOfResidence in Germany or EEAplusCH.\n\nThe second part requires that if the child is in EEA/Switzerland, then the parent has the tax condition.\n\nBut since SHACL can't express that, perhaps we need to model it as two separate constraints:\n\n1. The child's country is Germany/EEA/Switzerland.\n\nOR\n\n2. The child's country is in EEA/Switzerland AND the parent has the tax condition.\n\nBut how to express this in SHACL?\n\nMaybe:\n\nThe User must have at least one child where:\n\nEither:\n\n- Child's country is Germany/EEA/Switzerland,\n\nOR\n\n- Child's country is EEA/Switzerland AND the User has the tax condition.\n\nThis can be represented with sh:or on the User's properties.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:or (\n  [sh:property [\n    sh:path [sh:inversePath ff:hasChild];  # Wait, no. The path should be from the User to the child's country.\n    sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence;\n    sh:or (\n      [sh:hasValue ff:Germany],\n      [sh:node [sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH]]\n    )\n  ]],\n  \n  [sh:and (\n    [sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence;\n      sh:node [sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH]\n    ]],\n    [sh:property [sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability; sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability;]]\n  )]\n)\n\nWait, but the first part (the first sh:or option) requires that all children have country in Germany or EEA, but the condition allows at least one child to meet it. Hmm, SHACL's minCount may be needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the User must have a child (at least one) where the child's country is Germany/EEA/Switzerland OR (child's country is EEA/Switzerland AND User has tax condition).\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the problem expects to simplify, focusing on the main conditions without the nested OR.\n\nPerhaps the main points are:\n\nFor the child:\n\n- The child's countryOfResidence must be in Germany, EU/EEA, or Switzerland.\n\nOR\n\n- The parent has unlimited tax liability and the child is in EU/EEA/Switzerland.\n\nBut without SPARQL, it's challenging. Perhaps the simplest way is to require that the child's country is in Germany/EEA/Switzerland, and optionally if the child is elsewhere, the parent's tax must be met.\n\nAlternatively, the main condition is that the child's country is in Germany/EEA/Switzerland, and the parent has the tax condition OR other eligibility.\n\nWait the user's main conditions already include the tax condition, so perhaps the child's country must be in Germany/EEA/Switzerland OR (child is in EU/EEA/Switzerland and the parent's tax is met).\n\nBut without SPARQL, maybe we can only model the first part (child in Germany/EEA/Switzerland) and the second part (parent tax) as a separate condition.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect that the child's residence is in Germany or EEA/Switzerland, so:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasChild / ff:countryOfResidence;\n  sh:or (\n    [sh:hasValue ff:Germany],\n    [sh:node [sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH]]\n  )\n]\n\nBut that requires that all children have that, but the condition allows even if some don't. So perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that there exists at least one child (the one being claimed for) who meets the condition.\n\nThus, the User must have at least one child (ff:hasChild) where the child's countryOfResidence is Germany or in EEAplusCH.\n\nAdditionally, if the child is in EU/EEA/Switzerland, then the parent must have the tax condition, but since the parent's tax is already a condition in the main shape, it's covered.\n\nAlternatively, the main shape already includes the tax condition as an option, so this might be sufficient.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe full SHACL shape would look like this:\n\nA shape targeting ff:User, with constraints for the parent's eligibility (tax or EU/EEA/Switzerland conditions or residence/refugee status), and a constraint on the child's country.\n\nI think I'll proceed to draft the SHACL code now.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ChildBenefitEligibilityShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Parent must be subject to unlimited income tax in Germany (core condition)\n    sh:path ff:incomeTaxLiability ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n  ] , [\n    # OR: EU/EEA/Switzerland citizen fulfilling freedom of movement criteria\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isNationalOf ;\n        sh:hasValue [ sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH ] ;\n      ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:or (\n            # Employment status must be employed/self-employed or job-seeking\n            [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n              sh:hasValue [ sh:instanceOf [ sh:unionOf ( ff:Employee ff:SelfEmployed ) ] ] ;\n            ] ,\n            [ sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n              sh:hasValue ff:JobSeeker ;\n            ] ,\n            # Derives freedom of movement from a family member\n            [ sh:path ff:derivesFreedomOfMovementFrom ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n            ] ,\n            # Sufficient means and health insurance\n            [ sh:path ff:sufficientMeansOfSubsistence ;\n              sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ,\n            [ sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n              sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ] ,\n            # Permanent residence right\n            [ sh:path ff:permanentRightOfResidence ;\n              sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n            ]\n          ) ;\n        ]\n      ]\n    )\n  ] , [\n    # OR: Non-EU citizen with valid residence permit or refugee/asylee status\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:path ff:hasResidencePermit ;\n        sh:hasValue [ sh:path ff:entitlesToEmployment ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ;\n      ] ,\n      [ sh:path ff:recognizedRefugee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ,\n      [ sh:path ff:entitledToAsylum ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  # Child must reside in Germany/EEA/Switzerland or parent has unlimited tax liability + child in EU\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:or (\n      # Child's residence in Germany or EEA/Switzerland\n      [ sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:or (\n          [ sh:hasValue ff:Germany ] ,\n          [ sh:node [ sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH ] ]\n        )\n      ] ] ,\n      # Child in EEA/Switzerland AND parent has unlimited tax liability\n      [ sh:and (\n        [ sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ; sh:node [ sh:instanceOf ff:EEAplusCH ] ] ,\n        [ sh:path ( ff:incomeTaxLiability ) ; sh:hasValue ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability ]\n      ) ]\n    )\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Ausbildungsgeld' (Training Allowance) benefit with IDLB B100019_LB_574711 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst condition: The user has a disability and their rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency. Looking at the ontology, 'hasDisability' is a data property under ff:Person which is a boolean. So I need to check if this is true. Also, the rehabilitation provider must be ff:FederalEmploymentAgency. The property for rehabilitation provider is ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which connects a person to the provider. So the shape should require that the user has a value of true for ff:hasDisability and that their ff:hasRehabilitationProvider is exactly ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nSecond condition: The user is participating in one of the specified measures. The options are (first) vocational training, vocational preparatory education including basic training, individual company qualification in supported employment, or entry procedure/education area in a workshop for disabled people or other providers. \n\nLooking at the ontology, 'participates' links a person to a Training instance. The types of training mentioned can be mapped to subclasses or specific instances. \n\n- \"erste berufliche Ausbildung\" (first vocational training) is indicated by the data property ff:isFirstVocationalTraining set to true. The class for vocational training is ff:VocationalTraining.\n- \"berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme inkl. Grundausbildung\" – maybe this is covered under ff:Training or another subclass. The ontology has ff:School as a subclass of Training, but maybe it's better to check if the training is of type VocationalTraining, but the exact class might not be listed. Alternatively, perhaps the entry procedure and vocational training area is a specific instance, which is ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n- \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" – this is more specific, but I might need to see if there's a corresponding class. Since it's not explicitly listed, perhaps it's part of VocationalTraining or another subclass. Maybe I need to ensure that the training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true?).\n- \"Eingangsverfahren oder Berufsbildungsbereich in einer Werkstatt für behinderte Menschen...\" corresponds to ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, which is a subclass of Training. So the training instance must be of that type.\n\nTherefore, the 'participates' property must link to a Training instance that is either VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true, or EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or another specific type. Alternatively, perhaps the SHACL needs to check that the participates link is to a Training that is one of these types. But since SHACL Core doesn't support checking the class of the target node directly, maybe we can use sh:class to specify allowed classes. Wait, SHACL Core has sh:class, so for the object property ff:participates, the target should be a node of certain classes. Let me see:\n\nThe possible training types are:\n- VocationalTraining (if it's the first)\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n- Maybe others like School?\n\nAlternatively, the conditions might require that the participates link's target is of a certain type and/or has certain properties. For example, if it's a VocationalTraining, then it must have isFirstVocationalTraining true. But in SHACL, perhaps we can model this with a shape for the Training node that has either of the required classes or properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first vocational training is captured by the ff:isFirstVocationalTraining being true. So the Training instance must have that property set to true, or be of the correct class.\n\nAlternatively, since the user must be participating in one of the listed types, the ff:participates must point to a node that is an instance of one of the allowed classes (like VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, etc.). So in SHACL, for the property ff:participates, we can specify that the target node must be of a certain class. So the shape would have a sh:path of ff:participates and sh:class [ oneOf (ff:VocationalTraining ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ...) ].\n\nThird condition: The user has no entitlement to transitional allowance (Übergangsgeld). The Übergangsgeld is the individual ff:B100019_LB_102716305. The user must not have an ff:isEligibleFor link to this benefit. In SHACL, this would be a sh:property with sh:path ff:isEligibleFor and sh:nodeKind sh:IRI, and sh:disjoint with that benefit.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe main shape targets ff:User, so the SHACL starts with a shape that's a sh:NodeShape with sh:targetClass ff:User.\n\nFirst condition:\n- hasDisability must be true\n- hasRehabilitationProvider must be exactly FederalEmploymentAgency\n\nSecond condition:\n- participates must point to a Training node that is one of the allowed types (like VocationalTraining, EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, etc.)\n\nThird condition:\n- must not have an isEligibleFor link to B100019_LB_102716305\n\nWait, the third condition says \"keinen Anspruch auf Übergangsgeld\" (no entitlement to transitional allowance). The transitional allowance is the benefit B100019_LB_102716305. So the user must not have this benefit in their isEligibleFor list. So the SHACL should have a constraint that the user does not have an ff:isEligibleFor pointing to that benefit. So in SHACL terms, that would be:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n  sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;\n  sh:not [\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305\n  ]\n]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:disjoint, but maybe sh:not with a sh:hasValue is better here.\n\nNow for the second condition's training types. The allowed measures include:\n\n- (first) vocational training (VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true)\n- vocational preparatory education including basic training (maybe part of Training, but perhaps another subclass)\n- individual company qualification in supported employment (maybe part of VocationalTraining or another subclass)\n- entry procedure or vocational training area in a workshop for disabled (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea)\n\nLooking at the ontology, the EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training. VocationalTraining is another subclass. The other options might be under VocationalTraining but with certain properties. Since the user is participating in one of the listed measures, the target of participates must be an instance of one of those specific Training subclasses. So in SHACL, for the ff:participates property, the target must be a node of one of those classes. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;  // must have at least one participation\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VocationalTraining ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ) ] ;\n]\n\nWait, but the user needs to be participating in one of the listed measures. So the participates property must have at least one value that is an instance of one of the allowed classes. So the sh:class constraint would ensure that any participates target is one of those classes, but maybe the user could have multiple participations, so as long as at least one is valid. Hmm, but SHACL's sh:class would require that all targets are of those classes, which is not necessary. So maybe a better approach is to require that there exists at least one participates object with the correct class. To model this, perhaps a SHACL path using sh:someValuesFrom. Wait, in SHACL, for a property, you can use sh:someValuesFrom to specify that at least one of the objects is in a certain class. Wait, no, sh:someValuesFrom is for the range. Alternatively, the path could have a sh:hasClass constraint. Wait, perhaps the way to do it is with a property path and a class constraint.\n\nAlternatively, use a nested shape where the participates must have at least one value with a certain class. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;  // must have at least one\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n  sh:qualifiedValues [\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VocationalTraining ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ) ] ;\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, maybe that's the way. The qualifiedMinCount ensures that at least one of the targets satisfies the class condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vocational training part requires that if it's a VocationalTraining, then it must be the first. So for VocationalTraining instances, the ff:isFirstVocationalTraining must be true. But that complicates things. The problem is that the condition says \"erste berufliche Ausbildung\" which is first vocational training. So perhaps the VocationalTraining must have the data property ff:isFirstVocationalTraining set to true. So for VocationalTraining, the node must have that property set to true, but for EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, maybe it's okay without that.\n\nTherefore, the allowed Training nodes must be either:\n\n- VocationalTraining with ff:isFirstVocationalTraining = true, or\n\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n\nOr maybe the vocational training doesn't need to be first, but the condition says \"erste\" (first). So the first vocational training. So the training must be of VocationalTraining type and have isFirstVocationalTraining true.\n\nSo in SHACL, the shape for the participates target would need to have a constraint that if the node is a VocationalTraining, then it must have isFirstVocationalTraining = true, OR be EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. This requires a more complex shape, but since SHACL Core doesn't have OR conditions in the same way, perhaps splitting into two possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, the shape for the Training node could have a disjunction:\n\nEither (class VocationalTraining AND isFirstVocationalTraining true) OR class EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nBut in SHACL Core, perhaps the best way is to have a shape for the participates nodes that requires either:\n\n- (a) it's a VocationalTraining and has isFirstVocationalTraining true, OR\n\n- (b) it's an EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nTo model this, perhaps use sh:or in the node constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the user must be participating in at least one of the allowed types, the main shape could have a sh:property for participates with a sh:class check for any of the allowed classes, but that doesn't handle the isFirst condition for VocationalTraining.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit tricky. Let me see the ontology again. The VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training. The individual isFirstVocationalTraining is a data property on Training? Wait, looking back at the ontology:\n\nDataProperty: ff:isFirstVocationalTraining\n  Domain: ff:Training\n  Range: xsd:boolean\n\nYes. So, the VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training, so it can have that property. So, for VocationalTraining instances to qualify, they must have isFirstVocationalTraining true. EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is another subclass, which may not need that property.\n\nSo the participates must point to a Training node that is either:\n\n- (VocationalTraining AND ff:isFirstVocationalTraining = true)\n\nOR\n\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nSo in SHACL terms, the target of participates must satisfy either of these conditions. To express this, perhaps use a shape with sh:or for the node's constraints.\n\nAlternatively, create a nested shape for the Training node with:\n\nsh:or ( [\n    sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n  ] [\n    sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n  ]\n)\n\nTherefore, in the main shape for the user, the participates property must have at least one value that conforms to this nested shape.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape will have:\n\n- A shape for the user (targeting ff:User).\n\n- Constraints:\n\n1. ff:hasDisability must be true.\n\n2. ff:hasRehabilitationProvider must be exactly ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n3. The participates property must have at least one value that is either:\n\n   a. VocationalTraining with ff:isFirstVocationalTraining true, or\n\n   b. EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea (or other allowed types if needed).\n\n4. Must NOT have ff:isEligibleFor pointing to B100019_LB_102716305.\n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:TrainingAllowanceShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            sh:or (\n                [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n                  sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n                  sh:property [\n                      sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                      sh:hasValue true ;\n                  ] ;\n                ] \n                [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n                  sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n                ]\n            ) \n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the third condition (participates) needs to ensure that there's at least one participation in one of the allowed types. The sh:qualifiedValues with sh:or gives the options, and sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ensures that at least one of the targets meets one of the node shapes.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is better as:\n\nFor the participates property:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # must have at least one participation\n    sh:node [\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] \n            ] \n            [ sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but I think the correct syntax for nested node shapes is to use sh:node with a shape that has sh:or. Alternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount and sh:qualifiedValues with a node shape that uses sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the qualifiedValues is a node shape that uses sh:or.\n\nWait, the SHACL documentation says that sh:qualifiedValues is a NodeShape that the value must conform to. So the structure above with sh:or in the node shape's sh:or would work.\n\nWait, actually, the syntax for sh:or in SHACL is part of the NodeShape. So each element in the sh:or list is a NodeShape. So the above structure would work. So the participates must have at least one value that is either:\n\n- A VocationalTraining with isFirstVocationalTraining true, or\n\n- An EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nBut the original conditions also mention other measures like \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\". I need to check if there's a corresponding class in the ontology. Looking back:\n\nThe ontology includes \"EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\" which covers Eingangsverfahren or Berufsbildungsbereich. The other parts like \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung\" might not have an explicit class. Since the ontology might not have that specific class, perhaps it's part of VocationalTraining, or another subclass. Since it's not listed, maybe it's better to stick to what's in the ontology. The problem mentions \"Eingangsverfahren oder Berufsbildungsbereich in einer Werkstatt...\" which is covered by EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nThe vocational preparatory education might be under another subclass. Since it's not listed, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nNow the third condition: no entitlement to Übergangsgeld (B100019_LB_102716305). So the user must not have an isEligibleFor link to this benefit. The SHACL for that would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:not [\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305\n    ]\n]\n\nThis ensures that the user does not have that benefit in their isEligibleFor list.\n\nWait, but SHACL's sh:not can be tricky. The sh:not applies to the path's value. So if the path has any values that are that benefit, it would fail. So the above is correct.\n\nPutting all together, the final SHACL should look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:TrainingAllowanceShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    \n    # Condition 1: User has a disability and rehabilitation provider is FederalEmploymentAgency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Condition 2: Participates in allowed training measures\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValues [\n            sh:or (\n                # VocationalTraining must be first (isFirstVocationalTraining = true)\n                [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n                  sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n                  sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue true ] ;\n                ]\n                # EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea (Eingangsverfahren/Berufsbildungsbereich)\n                [ a sh:NodeShape ;\n                  sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Condition 3: No eligibility for Übergangsgeld (B100019_LB_102716305)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n        ]\n    ]\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the unemployment benefit 'Arbeitslosengeld' (Unemployment Benefit) based on the provided conditions. Let me start by parsing the requirements from the text.\n\nFirst, the user must be unemployed, which means either not in an employment relationship or working less than 15 hours a week. Also, they must be available for placement by the employment agency. \n\nLooking at the ontology, the employment status should be 'Unemployed' (ff:Unemployed). The employment hours are tracked via ff:workHoursPerWeek on their employment. If they have an employment, the hours must be less than 15. The availability for placement is a boolean property ff:availableForPlacement which must be true.\n\nNext, the user must have registered as unemployed either electronically or in person. Since the ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus, maybe the registration is captured through their employment status being 'RegisteredUnemployed' (ff:RegisteredUnemployed). But the text mentions registration via eServices or in person, but the ontology's ff:User is already a Person, so maybe the status is set via employment status.\n\nThe third condition requires at least 12 months of compulsory insurance in the last 30 months before registration. The ontology has ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30, which is a boolean that should be true. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for the properties. The ff:User must be the target node. Each condition translates into SHACL constraints.\n\nStarting with the shape for the User node:\n\n1. Employment Status must be Unemployed or working less than 15 hours. Wait, actually, the user is considered unemployed if they are not in employment or working less than 15h/week. So the employment status should be 'Unemployed' (ff:Unemployed individual). Alternatively, the ff:inEmployment property (boolean) must be false, or if employed, the work hours per week must be <15.\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:inEmployment (boolean) which indicates if the person is in an employment relationship. If they are not inEmployment (ff:inEmployment is false) OR if they are inEmployment but their employment's workHoursPerWeek is less than 15. Also, the availableForPlacement must be true.\n\nHmm, SHACL can handle this with a SPARQL constraint or using SHACL-Core components. Since the user must be in the Unemployed status (ff:Unemployed), maybe the ff:hasEmploymentStatus must be exactly ff:Unemployed. Let me check the ontology's Individual definitions. The ff:Unemployed is an EmploymentStatus type, which is part of the conditions. So perhaps the employment status is set to Unemployed. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have either:\n\n- ff:inEmployment is false AND availableForPlacement is true, OR\n- ff:inEmployment is true but their employment's ff:workHoursPerWeek < 15 AND availableForPlacement is true.\n\nBut in SHACL, combining these conditions might be tricky without SPARQL. Since we can only use SHACL Core, maybe split into multiple shapes. \n\nWait, the SHACL Core has sh:and and sh:or. So perhaps:\n\nThe employment status must be such that either (inEmployment is false OR workHoursPerWeek <15), and availableForPlacement is true.\n\nAlternatively, the ff:hasEmploymentStatus must be ff:Unemployed. Since the ontology's ff:Unemployed is an EmploymentStatus, that might be the right way. The user's hasEmploymentStatus should be exactly ff:Unemployed. Let me confirm the ontology's ff:Unemployed definition:\n\nYes, the ontology says ff:Unemployed is a type of EmploymentStatus, and its comment says \"You are available for the agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" So setting the employment status to Unemployed would encapsulate that condition. Therefore, the first condition is that the user must have ff:hasEmploymentStatus exactly equal to ff:Unemployed.\n\nNext, the registration part: the user must have registered via eServices or in person. The ontology might not have a direct property for registration method, but the act of registration is probably captured by the employment status being Unemployed. Since the user must have that status, perhaps that's sufficient. The text also mentions an application form, but that's a procedural step, not a data property. Since the problem says not to model ambiguous or third-party decisions, maybe we ignore the form part as it's about submission rather than data validation.\n\nThird condition: the 12 months in 30 must be covered by the boolean ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 being true. So the user must have that property set to true.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape would target ff:User, with three constraints:\n\n1. hasEmploymentStatus must be exactly Unemployed.\n2. availableForPlacement must be true (though maybe the employment status already implies that, but better to include).\nWait, the employment status's definition includes availability for placement. However, to be thorough, maybe the ff:availableForPlacement is a separate property. Let me check the ontology. The ontology does have a DataProperty ff:availableForPlacement (boolean), which is \"True if a person is able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions, false otherwise.\" So that's a separate property. Therefore, the user must have availableForPlacement = true.\n\nWait, but the ff:Unemployed employment status might already require that. However, the SHACL should enforce both conditions: employment status and availableForPlacement. Or perhaps the employment status implies it, but since SHACL is about explicit constraints, better include both.\n\nWait, the user's employment status is set to Unemployed, which according to the ontology's comment, implies availability. But to ensure, maybe the availableForPlacement is redundant. However, the SHACL should enforce that the availableForPlacement is true, regardless of the employment status. Let me recheck the problem's conditions. The user must be available for placement, so that's a separate condition. Therefore, two separate constraints:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus must be exactly Unemployed.\n- availableForPlacement must be true.\n\nThird, compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true.\n\nThus, the SHACL shape would look like this:\n\nStart with a shape for the User node:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UnemploymentBenefitShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the employment status might also be in an employment with less than 15 hours. Wait, the initial analysis thought that the employment status is set to Unemployed, which covers that scenario. Because the employment status's definition includes being in employment for less than 15 hours. So the ff:hasEmploymentStatus being Unemployed already includes that case. Therefore, no need to check the employment's work hours because that's encapsulated in the employment status.\n\nTherefore, the three constraints are as above.\n\nNow, the SHACL syntax. Each property constraint is in a separate sh:property block.\n\nAlso, the shape needs to be named. Since the benefit is B100019_LB_576842 (Arbeitslosengeld), perhaps the shape is named something like ff:ArbeitslosengeldShape.\n\nWait, the SHACL shapes are in the same namespace as the ontology. So:\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # because it must target the User node\n\nThen the three properties.\n\nWait, the employment status must have exactly one value, and it must be ff:Unemployed. So sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed.\n\nYes. The other two are boolean properties set to true.\n\nI think that's all. Let me double-check the text requirements:\n\n- unemployed (status), available for placement (covered by the status?), but better to have both.\n\nWait, the text says \"you are available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" So the availability is part of the unemployment status. However, the availableForPlacement property is a separate data property, so perhaps the shape should include that as a must.\n\nTherefore, including both:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus = Unemployed\n- availableForPlacement = true\n\nThis way, even if someone has the Unemployed status but the availableForPlacement is false, it's invalid. So including both is safer.\n\nHence, the SHACL shape as above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the given social benefit conditions. Let's start by understanding the requirements.\n\nThe benefit is 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' with the ID B100019_LB_102799525. The conditions are:\n\n1. The applicant must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance.\n2. They must have remarried or entered a new civil partnership after being widowed.\n\nFirst, I'll check the ontology for relevant properties and classes. \n\nFor the first condition: The claim to survivors' benefits. The ontology has ff:isEligibleFor linking a person to a social benefit. The survivors' benefit might be a specific benefit, but the exact individual isn't listed here. Alternatively, maybe the 'StatutoryAccidentInsurance' (ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance) is involved. Wait, the ontology has ff:hasInsurance, so maybe the user must have that insurance. Or perhaps the 'triggeringEvent' like a work accident leading to death? Hmm. The exact property might be ff:isEligibleFor linked to the specific benefit. Since the benefit's ID is given but not in the ontology, maybe the condition is that the user has a claim (i.e., is eligible for the benefit). Wait, the benefit in question is the one we're validating, so maybe the first condition is that they have a claim to another benefit (Hinterbliebenenleistung). Let me see the ontology's social benefits. There's ff:B100019_LB_102716305 labeled \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance\". Maybe the Hinterbliebenenleistung is another benefit, but not listed here. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have an event (like the death of a spouse) covered by the accident insurance. Alternatively, the user must be eligible for the survivors' benefit, so using ff:isEligibleFor with the appropriate SocialBenefit individual. Since the exact one isn't present, maybe we can't model that. Alternatively, maybe the ontology has a property indicating the claim. Wait, looking at data properties: 'receivedWithinLast3Years' is on SocialBenefit, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have a legal event (like a death caused by an accident), so they have an ff:causeOfDeath linked to a WorkAccident (ff:WorkAccident). Then, the ff:causeOfDeath must be an instance of WorkAccident. Also, the user must be the beneficiary, so maybe through being a spouse or civil partner of the deceased. Hmm, but the ontology has ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. So perhaps the user must have a deceasedSpouse whose causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident. Wait, but the first condition is that they have a claim to survivors' benefits. Maybe the user must have a deceased spouse whose death was due to a work accident (covered by statutory accident insurance). So:\n\n- The user has a deceasedSpouse, and that spouse's causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident (a sublcass of Event). \n\nAlternatively, the user must be eligible for the survivors' benefit, but without the exact benefit in the ontology, maybe we can't model that directly. Since the ontology has ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an Insurance, maybe the user must have that insurance. But the condition is about having a claim, which might be more complex. Since the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits, perhaps they must be a beneficiary (like a spouse or civil partner) of someone who had an accident leading to death. \n\nAlternatively, the ontology's ff:hasInsurance could link the user to the StatutoryAccidentInsurance. But that might not directly indicate a claim. Maybe the user must have a deceased spouse who had the insurance, but that's getting complicated. Since the exact properties aren't clear, perhaps the first condition is best modeled by requiring that the user has a deceased spouse or civil partner whose causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident (since that's covered by accident insurance). \n\nNow the second condition: They have remarried or entered a new civil union after being widowed. The ontology has ff:MaritalStatus, with individuals like Married, Widowed. Also, the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood on MaritalStatus. So if the user's marital status is Married or in a civil union, and the newUnionAfterWidowhood is true, that would satisfy the second condition. \n\nSo the shape for ff:User should have two SHACL constraints:\n\n1. The user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner whose causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident. \n\n2. The user's marital status must have the newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nLet me structure this in SHACL.\n\nFirst, for the first condition:\n\nThe user must have a deceased spouse (ff:deceasedSpouse) or deceased civil partner (ff:deceasedCivilPartner). Let's assume the deceased person is linked via one of those properties. Then, the causeOfDeath of that deceased person must be a WorkAccident (ff:WorkAccident).\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL? The user has a deceased spouse, which is a person, and that person has a causeOfDeath which is a WorkAccident.\n\nSo:\n\n- The user must have at least one of ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner.\n\nThen, for each such deceased person (e.g., ?deceased), they must have a causeOfDeath that is an instance of ff:WorkAccident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's deceased spouse's causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident. \n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with a path that goes through the deceasedSpouse's causeOfDeath. But SHACL's path can traverse multiple properties. \n\nSo the shape would have a constraint:\n\nFor the deceasedSpouse (or deceasedCivilPartner), their causeOfDeath must be a WorkAccident.\n\nBut since the user can have multiple deceased partners, perhaps at least one of them must satisfy this.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a deceasedSpouse where the causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident, OR a deceasedCivilPartner with the same.\n\nSo using SHACL's \"or\" conditions.\n\nBut SHACL Core doesn't have \"or\" as a component, but can use multiple properties with different paths.\n\nAlternatively, two separate constraints, one for each property, but that might be redundant. Maybe better to use a disjunction via sh:or.\n\nWait, SHACL Core has sh:or which allows disjunctive constraints. So the first constraint can be:\n\nA shape where either (has a deceased spouse whose causeOfDeath is WorkAccident) OR (has a deceased civil partner with same).\n\nSo the first condition would be:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n   [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:someValuesFrom [ sh:minCount 1 ] ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ; sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] ]\n\n   [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:someValuesFrom [ sh:minCount 1 ] ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ; sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] ]\n\n)\n\nBut SHACL syntax might require using sh:or with multiple shapes.\n\nAlternatively, each condition as a separate constraint, but that might not be precise. Alternatively, the first part can be a constraint that the user has at least one of deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner with a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have either:\n\n- A deceasedSpouse with a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident, or\n\n- A deceasedCivilPartner with a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident.\n\nThus, the SHACL for the first condition is a disjunction of those two possibilities.\n\nNow the second condition:\n\nThe user's marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood true.\n\nThe user has a marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) which is an instance of MaritalStatus (e.g., Married), and that marital status has newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood (but newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property on MaritalStatus).\n\nWait, looking at the ontology, the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood is on MaritalStatus. So:\n\nThe user's marital status (ff:hasMaritalStatus) must have the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood equal to true.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL constraint would be:\n\nsh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:path ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ]\n\nWait, no. The path from the user to the marital status is ff:hasMaritalStatus. The marital status's newUnionAfterWidowhood is a direct property. So:\n\nThe path would be ff:hasMaritalStatus/ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ?\n\nWait, in SHACL, the path can be a sequence of properties. So the path is:\n\nff:hasMaritalStatus -> then the newUnionAfterWidowhood data property on that node.\n\nThus, the path is:\n\nsh:path [ a sh:Path ; sh:firstPath ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:secondPath ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:Path as a sequence:\n\nsh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood )\n\nSo the constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n]\n\nTherefore, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape for the User node must have these two constraints.\n\nLet me draft the Turtle:\n\nFirst, define a shape for the User node, which is a person (since the target is ff:User).\n\nThe shape would be something like:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # First condition: deceased spouse/civil partner with WorkAccident as causeOfDeath\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n              sh:property [\n                  sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                  sh:class ff:WorkAccident\n              ]\n            ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n              sh:property [\n                  sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                  sh:class ff:WorkAccident\n              ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Second condition: newUnionAfterWidowhood is true\n        sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n        sh:hasValue true\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the first condition uses sh:or. Each of the or's elements must be a shape that must be satisfied. So each element in the sh:or is a shape that must be satisfied. However, since it's an or, the user needs to satisfy at least one of the two shapes (either deceasedSpouse with causeOfDeath being WorkAccident, or deceasedCivilPartner similarly).\n\nAlternatively, each of the two paths (deceasedSpouse and deceasedCivilPartner) must have at least one instance where causeOfDeath is WorkAccident. The sh:or allows for either of the two conditions to be true.\n\nWait, but how to structure the SHACL for that. Let me think again. \n\nThe first condition requires that the user has a deceased spouse OR a deceased civil partner, and that the causeOfDeath of that deceased is a WorkAccident.\n\nSo, the user must have either:\n\n- A deceasedSpouse whose causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident, or\n\n- A deceasedCivilPartner whose causeOfDeath is a WorkAccident.\n\nThus, using sh:or to allow either of those two paths.\n\nThe first element of sh:or would be a shape that checks for deceasedSpouse with causeOfDeath being WorkAccident.\n\nThe second element would be the same for deceasedCivilPartner.\n\nEach of those would be a shape with:\n\nsh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; \n\nsh:minCount 1 ; \n\nsh:property [ sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ; sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nEach of the or conditions must ensure that the user has at least one such object (deceasedSpouse) with the causeOfDeath being WorkAccident.\n\nSo for the first condition in the or:\n\n[ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; \n  sh:minCount 1 ; \n  sh:property [ sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ; sh:class ff:WorkAccident ]\n]\n\nSimilarly for the second.\n\nTherefore, the full SHACL would have the sh:or with these two shapes.\n\nThus, the Turtle would look like:\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            [\n                sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ; \n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                    sh:class ff:WorkAccident\n                ]\n            ]\n            [\n                sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ; \n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                    sh:class ff:WorkAccident\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n        sh:hasValue true\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the 'sh:or' is a property that takes a list of shapes. Each shape in the list must be satisfied in turn. But in this case, the user must satisfy at least one of the two options (either deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner with the correct causeOfDeath). \n\nAlternatively, the first condition is that the user has at least one of the two relationships, and for that one, the causeOfDeath is correct. \n\nThis should be correctly captured by the sh:or.\n\nNow, checking the second condition: the user's marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true. \n\nThe path is ff:hasMaritalStatus (which points to the marital status instance) and then the data property newUnionAfterWidowhood on that instance. So the path is ff:hasMaritalStatus followed by ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood.\n\nThus, the path is written as ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ), and the value must be true.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, ensuring all terms are from the ontology. The WorkAccident is indeed a subclass in the ontology.\n\nAlso, the properties and classes used (ff:deceasedSpouse, ff:deceasedCivilPartner, ff:causeOfDeath, ff:MaritalStatus, ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood) are all present.\n\nAnother thing: the second condition says \"they have remarried or entered a new civil partnership after the widowhood\". The newUnionAfterWidowhood data property on MaritalStatus is exactly for that. So that's correct.\n\nThus, this should form the correct SHACL.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # First condition: Must have a deceased spouse/civil partner with work accident as cause of death\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            # Case: Deceased spouse with work accident cause\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:property [\n                  sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                  sh:class ff:WorkAccident\n              ]\n            ]\n            \n            # Case: Deceased civil partner with work accident cause\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n              sh:minCount 1 ;\n              sh:property [\n                  sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n                  sh:class ff:WorkAccident\n              ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Second condition: Must have new union after widowhood\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ) ;\n        sh:hasValue true\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\" with IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The conditions given are:\n\n1. The user receives benefits from the Grundversorgung (Basic Security, which I think is Sozialhilfe or similar).\n2. The need for the support was determined in a discussion with their Integrationsfachkraft (integration specialist).\n3. The participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure starts.\n\nFirst, I need to map these conditions to the ontology provided. Let me go through each condition one by one.\n\nStarting with the first condition: \"Sie erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" The Grundsicherung in Germany typically refers to Sozialhilfe (social assistance), which is represented as ff:SocialAssistance in the ontology. So the user must be receiving this benefit. Looking at the ontology, the property to link a person to a received benefit is ff:receivesBenefit. The SocialBenefit individual for Sozialhilfe is ff:SocialAssistance. So the first condition would check that the user has a ff:receivesBenefit link to ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: \"Die Notwendigkeit der Unterstützungsleistung wurde im Gespräch mit Ihrer Integrationsfachkraft festgestellt.\" Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The Integrationsfachkraft is part of the Jobcenter's support system, but the ontology doesn't have a direct property for this. The ontology has ff:participates which links a person to a training program, but the condition here is about a discussion with an integration specialist. Since SHACL needs to model this, maybe this is an implicit requirement that can't be directly assessed via the ontology properties. The user instructions say not to model ambiguous or third-party discretion requirements. Since this condition's fulfillment depends on a discussion outcome which isn't represented in the data, perhaps this can't be modeled and should be excluded. Wait, but maybe the participation in a program with the integration specialist is implied? Alternatively, maybe there's an implied property. Since the ontology doesn't have a specific property for this, I might have to exclude this condition as per the rules.\n\nThird condition: \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" The Jobcenter is the Bundesagentur für Arbeit (Federal Employment Agency), which is the ff:FederalEmploymentAgency individual. The user's participation in a training or measure must have been approved by them. Looking at the ontology, there's ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on the Training class. So if the user is participating in a training (ff:participates), that training must have ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true. The participation is via ff:participates, so the shape would check that the user has a participates link to a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nNow, putting this into SHACL. The target node is ff:User. The shapes should enforce these conditions.\n\nFirst condition: The user must have a receivesBenefit link to ff:SocialAssistance. So a sh:hasValue constraint on ff:receivesBenefit to include ff:SocialAssistance. But since it's a list, maybe using sh:property with sh:hasValue.\n\nWait, in SHACL, to check that a property has at least one value of a certain type, we can use sh:property with sh:class for the value, but here it's a specific instance (ff:SocialAssistance). So:\n\nFor the first condition:\n\nA shape that requires that the user has at least one ff:receivesBenefit that is exactly ff:SocialAssistance. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n]\n\nWait, but sh:hasValue checks if the property has that exact value. So that's correct.\n\nSecond condition: Since it's not modelable, we skip it as per the rules.\n\nThird condition: The user must participate in a training (ff:participates) which has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true. So the shape would require that for all participations (or at least one?), but the condition says \"Die Teilnahme wurde genehmigt\", so the user's participation in the measure (training) must have been approved by Jobcenter. Assuming the user is participating in a Training, then the Training must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency true. So the user must have at least one ff:participates where the target Training has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with a nested shape using sh:property and sh:node. The path would be ff:participates, then the node must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency;\n      sh:minCount 1;\n      sh:hasValue true;\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nPutting it all together, the shape for ff:User would have these constraints. The SHACL shape would be structured as:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:ValidationShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n  ],\n  [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n\nWait, but the data type for commissionedByEmploymentAgency is xsd:boolean, so the value should be \"true\"^^xsd:boolean. In Turtle, that's written as \"true\"^^xsd:boolean.\n\nAlso, need to make sure all prefixes are included. The user's ontology has ff: as a prefix, so in the SHACL, we need to use those.\n\nSo the final SHACL would have these two properties: receivesBenefit to SocialAssistance and participates in a Training with commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nI think that's all. The second condition is excluded because it's not representable in the ontology. The first and third conditions are covered.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:FörderungEingliederungShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Bedingung 1: Empfängt Leistungen der Grundsicherung (Sozialhilfe)\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n  ],\n  [\n    # Bedingung 3: Teilnahme wurde durch Jobcenter genehmigt\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      a sh:NodeShape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung' (IDLB B100019_LB_102717659). Let's start by understanding the requirements from the given text.\n\nFirst, the conditions listed are:\n\n1. The person has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of developing such a disability.\n2. Their responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit).\n3. Their prospects of participating in the workforce are significantly and not just temporarily reduced due to the nature and severity of their disability, hence needing support.\n4. They are willing to undergo vocational training or other integration measures.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to map these conditions to the available classes, properties, and individuals.\n\nStarting with the first condition: \"hochgradige Seh oder Hörbehinderung oder Ihnen droht eine solche Behinderung\". The ontology has ff:hasDisability (boolean) and ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType (object property pointing to Disability). The disabilities mentioned are Sehbehinderung (VisualImpairment) and Hörbehinderung (HearingImpairment). So, the person must either have a Disability of type VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, or be at risk of such. Additionally, the disability must be severe (since \"hochgradige\" translates to severe). The ontology has ff:severeDisability (boolean) on Disability.\n\nSo for the first condition, we need to check either:\n- They have a Disability (ff:hasDisability is true)\n- The Disability is of type VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment (ff:hasDisabilityType)\n- The Disability has ff:severeDisability true, or they are at risk (ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType pointing to those types). Wait, the risk part is separate. The person could either have the disability or be at risk. So the first condition is either:\n\nEither:\n- (hasDisability is true) AND (hasDisabilityType is VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment) AND (severeDisability is true)\nOR\n- (atRiskOfDisabilityType points to VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment)\n\nHmm, but how to represent this in SHACL. Maybe using sh:or with two shapes?\n\nSecond condition: rehabilitation provider is ff:FederalEmploymentAgency. The property is ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which should link to that individual.\n\nThird condition: their work prospects are significantly and not temporary reduced. The ontology has ff:EarningCapacity, which can be of type ReducedEarningCapacity. Also, there's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently (boolean) on Disability. Wait, the condition says \"not just temporarily\" so it's permanent. The EarningCapacity has ff:isPermanent (boolean) which might be relevant. Alternatively, the Disability's ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must be true. Also, the person's EarningCapacity must be reduced (maybe the type is ReducedEarningCapacity?), but the exact mapping needs to be checked.\n\nThe third condition states the reduction is not temporary, so perhaps the Disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently as true. Also, the person must need help to participate in the workforce, which might be inferred from this.\n\nFourth condition: willing to undergo vocational training or integration. The ontology has ff:availableForPlacement (boolean), which is \"able and willing to work...\" so maybe that should be true.\n\nNow, structuring this into SHACL shapes.\n\nThe target is ff:User, so the shapes will target that node.\n\nFirst condition:\n\n- The user must have either:\n\n  a) A disability (ff:hasDisability true) of type VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment (ff:hasDisabilityType) and severe (ff:severeDisability true)\n\n  OR\n\n  b) Be at risk of developing such a disability (ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType to those types)\n\nBut how to structure this in SHACL. Maybe two separate shapes for the two scenarios and use sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:and and sh:or within the constraints.\n\nLet me outline each condition step by step.\n\nFirst condition:\n\nEither:\n- (hasDisability = true) AND (hasDisabilityType is VisualImpairment OR HearingImpairment) AND (severeDisability = true)\nOR\n- (atRiskOfDisabilityType exists with target being VisualImpairment OR HearingImpairment)\n\nWait, the 'atRiskOfDisabilityType' is an object property to Disability. So the atRisk link must point to an instance of VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment. But in the ontology, the classes VisualImpairment and HearingImpairment are subclasses of Disability. So maybe the target can be checked via a class check.\n\nSo for the 'atRisk' part, the user must have at least one ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType whose object is an instance of either VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment. But how to express that in SHACL? Maybe using sh:class with sh:in (list of classes), but SHACL doesn't have a direct way to check the type of the object. Alternatively, if the ontology has instances of those disabilities, but maybe it's better to use a property path or some other approach. Hmm, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the SHACL could require that the user has an ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType that is either a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment. Since those are classes, perhaps using sh:class with those classes in a sh:or.\n\nWait, the object property's range is ff:Disability, so the target node must be a Disability. To check if it's a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, we can use sh:class with those classes in a sh:or.\n\nSo for the 'atRisk' part:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n]\n\nWait, but SHACL's sh:class is for checking the class of the object. So that would work. So if the user has at least one ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType link where the target is an instance of either of those classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have either a hasDisability with the conditions, or an atRisk link. So for the first condition, the user must satisfy either of two scenarios. So the shape for the first condition would be:\n\nsh:or ( \n  [ shape1 for having the disability ]\n  [ shape2 for being at risk ]\n)\n\nShape1:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisability;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nAND\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n]\n\nAND\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Wait, the severeDisability is a data property on Disability. So for the user's disability types, each hasDisabilityType must have severeDisability true? Or just the disability in question?\n\nHmm, perhaps the user must have at least one Disability (via hasDisabilityType) that is either VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment and has severeDisability true.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nff:hasDisabilityType [ a (ff:VisualImpairment, ff:HearingImpairment); ff:severeDisability true ]\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a hasDisabilityType that is an instance of VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment and has severeDisability true.\n\nThis can be done with a nested shape:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n  sh:some [\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ];\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n      sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nBut SHACL's nesting might not allow that. Maybe using sh:and within a shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nFor the first part (having the disability):\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisability;\n  sh:hasValue true\n],\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n],\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability );\n  sh:hasValue true\n]\n\nWait, but the last path would require that all hasDisabilityType have severeDisability true? No, it needs that at least one of them has that. Maybe using sh:someValuesFrom? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complex. Maybe it's better to split into separate constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first condition can be structured as:\n\nEither:\n\n- The user has a Disability (ff:hasDisability is true) and has at least one DisabilityType of Visual or Hearing which is severe.\n\nOR\n\n- The user is at risk of such a Disability (ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType points to a Disability of those types).\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL. Maybe using sh:or on two shapes.\n\nLet me try to outline the SHACL structure step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the User:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:BenefitShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102717659 ;\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for the benefit.\" ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:and (\n                # Condition 1\n                [\n                    sh:or (\n                        # Case 1: Has severe Visual/Hearing disability\n                        [\n                            sh:and (\n                                # hasDisability is true\n                                [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n                                # has a DisabilityType of Visual or Hearing\n                                [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType; sh:minCount 1;\n                                    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n                                ],\n                                # That Disability has severeDisability true\n                                # Hmm, how to connect the Disability's severeDisability?\n                                # Maybe a path like ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability )\n                                # but need to ensure at least one has it\n                                # So:\n                                [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability );\n                                    sh:minCount 1;\n                                    sh:hasValue true\n                                ]\n                            )\n                        ],\n                        # Case 2: At risk of such disability\n                        [\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType;\n                                sh:minCount 1;\n                                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n                # Condition 2: Rehabilitation provider is FederalEmploymentAgency\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n                ]\n                # Condition 3: Prospects reduced permanently\n                [\n                    sh:or (\n                        # The Disability has reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true\n                        # Or the EarningCapacity is reduced permanently?\n                        # The condition says the reduction is not temporary, so the Disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must be true.\n                        [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisability / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ); sh:hasValue true ],\n                        # Alternatively, if the person's EarningCapacity has isPermanent true?\n                        # The condition says \"wegen Art und Schwere Ihrer Behinderung nicht nur vorübergehend wesentlich gemindert\"\n                        # So the reduction is not temporary (permanent). So the Disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must be true.\n                        # So the path here is: hasDisability (which is true) and then the Disability has that property.\n                        # But maybe the user has an EarningCapacity that is reduced permanently (ff:isPermanent)?\n                        # Looking at the ontology, EarningCapacity has ff:isPermanent (boolean). But the condition is about the work prospects being reduced, which is linked to the disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently.\n\n                        # So perhaps:\n                        [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisability / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ); sh:hasValue true ],\n                        # Wait, but how to get to the Disability's property. The user has a Disability via ff:hasDisabilityType, but ff:hasDisability is a boolean. Maybe the user must have a Disability (ff:hasDisability true) and that Disability has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true?\n\n                        # Alternatively, the user's Disability must have ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true.\n                        # So:\n\n                        [ sh:property [\n                            sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently );\n                            sh:hasValue true\n                        ] ]\n                    )\n                ]\n                # Condition 4: availableForPlacement is true\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but let's check each condition:\n\nCondition 1:\n\nThe user must either have a severe visual/hearing disability or be at risk.\n\nFor the \"hasDisability\" case:\n\n- hasDisability must be true (ff:hasDisability true)\n- hasDisabilityType must include at least one of the two disabilities (Visual or Hearing)\n- And for at least one of those DisabilityTypes, severeDisability is true.\n\nWait, but the severeDisability is a property of the Disability instance. So the user's DisabilityType (which is an instance of VisualImpairment/HearingImpairment) must have severeDisability true.\n\nSo the path would be ff:hasDisabilityType's target must have ff:severeDisability true.\n\nThus, in SHACL, that can be expressed via a nested shape:\n\n[ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n  sh:some [\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ];\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n      sh:hasValue true\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nSo integrating that into the SHACL:\n\nThe first part (hasDisability case) would be:\n\n[\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n      sh:some [\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ];\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:severeDisability; sh:hasValue true ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  )\n]\n\nWait, but sh:some is not a SHACL construct. SHACL uses sh:property with sh:minCount and sh:class, etc. Maybe using sh:property with sh:class and another sh:property for the severeDisability.\n\nAlternatively, use a path that includes both the class check and the property. For example:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType [ a (ff:VisualImpairment, ff:HearingImpairment); ff:severeDisability true ] );\n  sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nBut SHACL doesn't support such complex paths directly. So perhaps the only way is to require that the user has at least one hasDisabilityType that is an instance of those classes AND has severeDisability true. That can be done with:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ];\n],\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability );\n  sh:hasValue true;\n  sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nWait, but that would require that all hasDisabilityType have severeDisability true, which is not desired. Instead, at least one must have it. So:\n\nThe first condition part for having the disability:\n\nThe user must have:\n\n- ff:hasDisability true\n\nAND\n\nAt least one hasDisabilityType that is either VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment AND has severeDisability true.\n\nSo:\n\n[\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n    [\n      sh:or (\n        [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / [ a ff:VisualImpairment; ff:severeDisability true ] ); sh:minCount 1 ],\n        [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / [ a ff:HearingImpairment; ff:severeDisability true ] ); sh:minCount 1 ]\n      )\n    ]\n  )\n]\n\nHmm, but again, the path syntax might not support this. Maybe using a separate shape for the DisabilityType:\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complex, so I'll proceed with the initial approach and see if I can structure it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe simplify:\n\nThe user must have ff:hasDisability true and has a DisabilityType of Visual or Hearing, and that Disability has severeDisability true. So:\n\n[\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType; sh:minCount 1; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ] ],\n    [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability ); sh:hasValue true ]\n  )\n]\n\nBut the last path would require that all hasDisabilityType have severeDisability true, which isn't correct. We need at least one of them to have it. Therefore, this approach won't work.\n\nPerhaps better to use sh:someValuesFrom in some way? Alternatively, this might be beyond SHACL Core's capability. Maybe the problem is that the ontology is not structured to allow this easily. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ff:hasDisabilityType is a link to a Disability instance which has the required properties. So the user must have at least one hasDisabilityType where the target is a VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment with severeDisability true.\n\nThus, the path could be ff:hasDisabilityType and then in that Disability, check the class and severeDisability.\n\nIn SHACL, using a property path with a filter, but SHACL doesn't have filters. So maybe:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path rdf:type;\n    sh:in ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment )\n  ];\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n    sh:hasValue true\n  ]\n]\n\nBut that would require that all hasDisabilityType have those properties, which is not right. We need at least one. So perhaps using sh:someValuesFrom with a nested shape?\n\nAlternatively, using a separate shape for the DisabilityType and then requiring that at least one has it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is too complex and the requirements can be approximated by assuming that if the user has a Disability of those types and severeDisability is true, then that's sufficient. Perhaps the severeDisability is a property of the Disability itself, so the user's hasDisabilityType must point to a Disability instance with that property.\n\nThus, perhaps:\n\nThe first part (hasDisability case) requires:\n\n- ff:hasDisability is true,\n\nAND\n\nhas at least one ff:hasDisabilityType which is an instance of Visual or Hearing and has ff:severeDisability true.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n[\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path rdf:type;\n          sh:in ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment )\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:severeDisability;\n          sh:hasValue true\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  )\n]\n\nBut I'm not sure if SHACL allows nested properties like this. The structure would be:\n\nThe user must have a hasDisabilityType that has both the type and the severeDisability. But this requires that all hasDisabilityType have those, which isn't desired. Maybe using sh:someValuesFrom with a shape?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach here is to use two separate conditions for the disability case:\n\n1. hasDisability is true,\n\nAND\n\n2. has at least one hasDisabilityType of the correct type (Visual or Hearing),\n\nAND\n\n3. has at least one hasDisabilityType (of those types) with severeDisability true.\n\nSo, three separate conditions:\n\n[\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType; sh:minCount 1; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ] ],\n    [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability ); sh:hasValue true; sh:minCount 1 ]\n  )\n]\n\nWait, the third part here would require that at least one of the hasDisabilityType has severeDisability true, which is correct.\n\nYes, this way:\n\n- The first condition ensures the user has a disability.\n\n- The second ensures at least one of the disability types is Visual/Hearing.\n\n- The third ensures at least one of those types has severeDisability true.\n\nThat should work.\n\nSo putting it all together for the first part (hasDisability):\n\n[\n  sh:and (\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisability; sh:hasValue true ],\n    [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType; sh:minCount 1; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ] ],\n    [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability ); sh:hasValue true; sh:minCount 1 ]\n  )\n]\n\nThe second part for being at risk:\n\n[\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n  ]\n]\n\nSo the first condition (either/or) becomes:\n\nsh:or (\n  [\n    sh:and ( ... the above three conditions ...)\n  ],\n  [\n    sh:property [ ... the atRisk condition ... ]\n  ]\n)\n\nNow, the second condition is straightforward: ff:hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nThird condition: the prospects are reduced permanently. The requirement is that the disability reduces work prospects permanently. The ontology has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently on Disability. So the user must have at least one Disability (via hasDisabilityType) where reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently );\n    sh:hasValue true;\n    sh:minCount 1\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, but the user must have a Disability (so ff:hasDisability is true) and that Disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true.\n\nAlternatively, the user's hasDisabilityType must have at least one Disability with that property.\n\nSo yes, the path ff:hasDisabilityType/ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently must have at least one true.\n\nFourth condition: availableForPlacement must be true.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe full shape would look like this. Now, I'll try to write the Turtle code accordingly, ensuring all constraints are correctly placed.\n\nAlso, the target is ff:User, so the shape should have sh:targetNode ff:User or sh:targetClass ff:User.\n\nWait, the problem says \"target the node 'ff:User'\". So perhaps using sh:targetNode.\n\nWait, SHACL can target by class or node. Since the user is an individual (ff:User), maybe sh:targetNode is better.\n\nBut the ontology says ff:User is an individual of type Person. The SHACL shape should apply to that node.\n\nSo:\n\nff:BenefitShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102717659 ;\n        sh:message \"Eligibility conditions not met.\" ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:and (\n                # Condition 1: Disability or at risk\n                [\n                    sh:or (\n                        # Case 1: Disability\n                        [\n                            sh:and (\n                                [ sh:path ff:hasDisability ; sh:hasValue true ],\n                                [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ; sh:minCount 1 ; sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ] ],\n                                [ sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:severeDisability ) ; sh:hasValue true ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n                            )\n                        ],\n                        # Case 2: At risk\n                        [\n                            sh:property [\n                                sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n                                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ]\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ],\n                # Condition 2: Rehabilitation provider\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n                ],\n                # Condition 3: Reduced prospects permanently\n                [\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ( ff:hasDisabilityType / ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ) ;\n                        sh:hasValue true ;\n                        sh:minCount 1\n                    ]\n                ],\n                # Condition 4: Available for placement\n                [\n                    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n                    sh:hasValue true\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the condition 3 is about the disability's reducesWorkProspectsPermanently.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for validating user data to determine eligibility for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' (B100019_LB_582422) social benefit. Let me start by understanding the requirements provided.\n\nFirst, the conditions are:\n1. The user has had a work-related accident, commute accident, or recognized occupational disease.\n2. The user is participating in a qualified measure for participation in work life (occupational rehabilitation).\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to map these conditions to the existing classes and properties.\n\nFor the first condition, the accidents and occupational disease are subclasses of Event. The ontology has:\n- WorkAccident (Arbeitsunfall)\n- CommutingAccident (Wegeunfall)\n- OccupationalDisease (Berufskrankheit)\n\nThese are all sub-classes of ff:Event. The user must have one of these events. Since the SHACL needs to check that the user has at least one such event, I should use sh:property with sh:hasValue to require the type to be one of these classes.\n\nNext, the second condition: participating in a qualified measure, which is \"berufliche Reha\". Looking at the ontology, there's ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. The user must be participating in an instance of this. The ontology has the property ff:participates which links a Person to a Training or similar. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the ObjectProperties, there's ff:participates which has domain ff:Person and range ff:Training. The ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class. Wait, but in the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class, so perhaps the participation should link to an instance of that class. However, the ff:participates property's range is ff:Training. Hmm, maybe there's a subclass? Let me check the Training subclasses:\n\nLooking at the ontology's classes:\n- ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class but not a subclass of Training. Wait, the description says \"berufliche Rehabilitation\". But in the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a separate class. However, the ff:participates property points to ff:Training. Maybe there's a missing link here? Wait, the user's participation should be in an occupational rehabilitation measure, which might be a subclass of Training? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the ontology's classes section, under Training subclasses:\n- ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training.\n- ff:School is also a subclass of Training.\n- ff:VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training.\n\nHmm, perhaps the occupational rehabilitation is part of a training program. Alternatively, maybe the ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is part of a different property. Let me think. The requirement says \"teilnehmen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" which translates to participating in a qualified measure for work participation. The term \"Maßnahme\" might correspond to an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. But how is that linked to the user?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is participating in a Training that is for rehabilitation. The ff:participates property links to Training. The ff:OccupationalRehabilitation might not be a Training but a separate entity. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe ontology shows that ff:OccupationalRehabilitation has a label \"Berufliche Rehabilitation\" which is the exact term used in the benefit description. However, the ff:participates property's range is ff:Training. Since there's no direct subclass of Training for this, perhaps the correct approach is to check that the user has a ff:participates link to an instance that is of type ff:OccupationalRehabilitation? But then the Training would need to be of that class. Wait, maybe the ff:OccupationalRehabilitation is a class that is a subclass of Training? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the ontology's classes:\nClass: ff:OccupationalRehabilitation\n    Annotations: rdfs:label \"Berufliche Rehabilitation\"@de \n\nWait, no. It's not listed as a subclass of anything. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the user's participation in a training that is part of an occupational rehabilitation. Alternatively, perhaps the ff:triggeringEvent or another property links to the OccupationalRehabilitation. Alternatively, perhaps the ff:participates should point to an instance that has a type of OccupationalRehabilitation, even though it's not a subclass of Training. But in the ontology, the range is Training, so the instance must be a Training. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"berufliche Reha\" is represented by the ff:participates linking to a Training that is for rehabilitation. Since the requirement specifies participation in a qualified measure for work participation, perhaps the Training must be of a certain type. However, without a specific subclass in the ontology, I might have to use the ff:OccupationalRehabilitation as a class and link it via another property. Alternatively, maybe the user has an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, and that is linked via another property. \n\nWait, looking at properties: \n\nThe ff:triggeringEvent is a property that links EarningCapacity or OccupationalRehabilitation to an Event. But that might not help here. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, but that's about who provides it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the participation in a Training is the key. Since the requirement says \"participating in a qualified measure\", maybe the Training itself must be of a certain type. Since the ontology includes ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea (which is a subclass of Training) and others, but not exactly occupational rehab, maybe the user's participation must be in a Training that is part of an occupational rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:participates link to a Training, and that Training is linked to an OccupationalRehabilitation via some other property. However, without explicit ontology definitions for that, I might need to make an assumption here. Since the requirement is for participating in a \"berufliche Reha\" (occupational rehabilitation), which is exactly the label of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, perhaps the participation is directly to an instance of that class. However, the ff:participates property's range is Training, so unless OccupationalRehabilitation is a subclass of Training, this would not be possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the ontology? Or maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the participation is in a Training that is linked to the OccupationalRehabilitation via another property. Alternatively, perhaps the \"participates\" is sufficient as long as the user has a Training instance, but I need to ensure that the Training is for occupational rehab. Since the ontology doesn't specify, maybe I have to model it as the user must have a participates link to any Training, but that might not be precise. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the user having a ff:participates to a Training that is somehow connected to the OccupationalRehabilitation class, but I can't see that in the ontology. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"qualified measure\" is just any participation in a Training, and the benefit's name implies it's for this purpose. Since the SHACL needs to validate based on existing ontology terms, perhaps the second condition is simply that the user has a participates property pointing to a Training instance. But that might be too broad. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a Training that has a subjectToContract of a certain type, or another property. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a ff:participates link to an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation. But since ff:participates requires the range to be Training, and ff:OccupationalRehabilitation isn't a subclass of Training, that would not be valid. So this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has an instance of ff:OccupationalRehabilitation linked via another property. Looking at properties, there's ff:resultsInTreatment which links an Event to an OccupationalRehabilitation. But that's the reverse. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to proceed with the information I have, even if there's some ambiguity. The second condition requires participation in a \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\" which is exactly \"berufliche Reha\". Since the ontology has the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, perhaps the user must have a participates link to an instance of that class. Even though the ontology says the range is Training, maybe it's a mistake and I should proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the correct property is another one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a ff:participates link to a Training, and the Training is of a certain type. Since the ontology includes ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which is a Training subclass, but that's for workshops for people with disabilities. Not sure if that's the same as occupational rehab. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's participation in any Training is sufficient, given that the benefit's name specifies it's for occupational rehab. Since the SHACL must use existing terms, perhaps the only way is to ensure that the user has a participates link to some Training. But that might not be precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different property. Looking at the ontology's properties, there's ff:hasRehabilitationProvider which links a Person to a RehabilitationProvider. But that doesn't indicate participation in the rehab itself. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The second condition might not be fully modeled in the ontology as provided. Since the problem states to not model requirements that are ambiguous or cannot be clearly assessed, perhaps I should proceed by checking that the user has a participates link to a Training, assuming that the Training is the qualified measure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a ff:participates link to an instance of the ff:OccupationalRehabilitation class, even if the ontology's ff:participates has range Training. Since OccupationalRehabilitation is not a subclass of Training, this would be invalid, but perhaps the ontology has an error. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_582422 which is not listed in the ontology's individuals, but perhaps the SHACL needs to reference the correct SocialBenefit. Looking at the ontology's individuals, there's an individual named B100019_LB_102716305 with label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld\", which matches the benefit name. Wait, the benefit's ID in the text is B100019_LB_582422, but the ontology has B100019_LB_102716305. Maybe it's a typo, but the user probably meant that. Since the user is to validate eligibility for that benefit, the SHACL shape should target ff:User and have a sh:targetClass ff:User, but according to the task, it must target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nSo, the SHACL will have a shape with targetNode ff:User.\n\nNow, for the first condition: the user must have an event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nTo check that the user has an event of one of these types, the SHACL can use a sh:property on the event's rdf:type. The user must have at least one such event linked via some property. Looking at the ontology, the user can have events via ff:hasEvent? Wait, ff:hasEvent is an object property with domain ff:Employer or ff:Person, and range ff:Event. So the user (ff:Person) can have an ff:hasEvent link to an Event. \n\nSo, the user must have at least one ff:hasEvent where the event is a subclass of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nA property path would be ff:hasEvent [ a sh:NodeShape; sh:class (ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease) ]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:property with sh:path as ff:hasEvent, and sh:class restriction.\n\nWait, the exact syntax would be:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ] ) ];\n]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using sh:or in the class constraint.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:qualifiedMinCount with sh:qualifiedValueShapes:\n\nWait, maybe better to use sh:property with sh:class and a sh:or of the three classes.\n\nWait, let me check the SHACL specs. The sh:class predicate can take a list of classes, but does that mean the node must be an instance of any of them? Or all?\n\nWait, according to SHACL, the sh:class is a list of classes, and the node must be an instance of all. So that won't work. So instead, need to use sh:or.\n\nSo the correct approach is to use a sh:NodeShape for the event and have a sh:or of the three classes.\n\nSo for the first condition:\n\nThe user must have at least one ff:hasEvent where the event is an instance of any of the three classes.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ]\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ]\n      [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n    )\n  ]\n]\n\nAlternatively, using sh:and with sh:or.\n\nNow, the second condition: participation in a qualified measure (occupational rehab). The user must have a participates link to a Training (since ff:participates has range Training). But how to ensure that the Training is for occupational rehab. Since the ontology has ff:OccupationalRehabilitation as a class but not a subclass of Training, perhaps the Training must have a certain property. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a participates link to a Training instance that has a certain property, like being commissioned by the employment agency, but the requirement doesn't specify that. The requirement just says \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\", which is occupational rehabilitation. Since the ontology has the class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, but participation is via Training, maybe the Training must be part of that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a ff:participates to a Training that is linked to an ff:OccupationalRehabilitation instance via some other property. But without knowing that, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, since the benefit's name includes \"berufliche Reha\", perhaps the participation is sufficient if they're in any Training, but that's too broad. Since the ontology doesn't provide a more precise link, maybe I can only model the participation in any Training, but that might not be accurate. However, the user instruction says not to model ambiguous requirements. Since the second condition might be ambiguous in the ontology, perhaps it's better to model the participation in a Training (since the ontology allows that) and assume that the presence of the Training is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a ff:participates to a Training that has a certain property. Looking at the properties related to Training, there's ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency (a boolean), ff:recognizedByLaw (linked to LegalCode), etc. Maybe the requirement requires that the training is commissioned by the employment agency. But the text doesn't specify that. The description just says \"qualifizierte Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben\". Since the user must have participated in such a measure, perhaps the Training must be of a certain type. But without ontology info, I can't map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ff:participates to any Training is sufficient. Since the user's description requires participation in a qualified measure, and the ontology's ff:participates links to Training, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo for the second condition, the user must have at least one ff:participates link to a Training instance.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:class ff:Training;  // Not sure if needed, since range is Training already, but maybe to enforce it\n]\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shape for the User node would have these two properties.\n\nAdditionally, the shape should be targeting the ff:User node, since the task says \"target the node 'ff:User'\".\n\nThe shape would look like:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] ;\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] ;\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ] \n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the 'or' is a list of shapes, so the semicolons inside might not be correct. In Turtle, the list elements are separated by commas. Let me correct that:\n\nsh:or (\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ],\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ],\n    [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ]\n)\n\nAlso, the second property's sh:class is redundant since the range is already Training, but maybe better to include for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the participation must be to an instance of a specific subclass, but since it's not in the ontology, I can't do that.\n\nSo this should be the SHACL.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 1: User must have a work/commute accident or occupational disease\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:node [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:WorkAccident ] \n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:CommutingAccident ] \n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:OccupationalDisease ] \n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Requirement 2: User must participate in occupational rehabilitation (modeled as Training participation)\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the Insolvenzgeld benefit based on the provided conditions. Let me start by understanding each requirement from the German text.\n\nFirst, the benefit ID is B100019_LB_576848. Looking at the ontology, I see that SocialBenefit instances include things like Arbeitslosengeld, so I should check if there's an individual for Insolvenzgeld. Wait, the text mentions the IDLB B100019_LB_576848. In the ontology's Individuals section, I see ff:B100019_LB_576842 is Arbeitslosengeld, so maybe the actual ID here is B100019_LB_576848? But the ontology doesn't list it. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, but since the user provided the text, I'll use the given ID as a SocialBenefit.\n\nFirst condition: There must be an Insolvency event. The event can be one of three types: opening of insolvency proceedings, rejected application for lack of assets, or discontinuation of business due to obvious lack of assets. In the ontology, Insolvenzverfahren (insolvency proceeding) is InsolvencyProceeding, which is a subclass of Event. The rejected application is InsolvencyApplication with rejectedForLackOfAssets=true. The third point is DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets=true.\n\nSo, the first part requires that the user has an event which is either an InsolvencyProceeding that's open, an InsolvencyApplication rejectedForLackOfAssets, or a DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets. But in SHACL, how to model that? Maybe a sh:or condition on the triggering event.\n\nSecond condition: Before the insolvency event, no wage was paid for up to 3 months. The wageCutOffsetMonths property on the event should be between -3 and 0? Or maybe the event's hasDate needs to be within a certain timeframe relative to when the wage wasn't paid. Alternatively, maybe the event has a wageCutOffsetMonths <= 3. Wait, the wageCutOffsetMonths is the number of months within which a wage cut occurred relative to the event. So if the wage wasn't paid for up to 3 months before the event, then wageCutOffsetMonths would be between -3 and 0? Not sure. The description says \"Vor dem Insolvenzereignis wurde Ihnen bis zu 3 Monate lang kein Arbeitsentgelt gezahlt.\" So before the event, there was a period of up to 3 months without payment. So maybe the wageCutOffsetMonths is between -3 and 0? Or perhaps the property needs to be present with a value between -3 and 0. Alternatively, maybe the event has a wageCutOffsetMonths <= 0 and >= -3. So in SHACL, sh:hasValue with a data range.\n\nThird condition: As an employee, the user is either employed in Germany or temporarily sent abroad while maintaining social security in Germany. So the employment's countryOfEmployment is Germany, or if sent abroad, the socialSecurityCountry is Germany. Also, the employment status must be Employee (since the user must be an employee). The employment's countryOfEmployment is Germany OR the user is sent abroad but still under German social security.\n\nFourth condition: Need to prove via a decision from the Clearingstelle der Deutschen Rentenversicherung (probably the Federal Employment Agency, which is an instance of RehabilitationProvider: ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) that they are legally considered an employee. This might involve having a hasEmploymentStatus of Employee, but perhaps an additional condition that the user has a status determined by the agency. Since the ontology has ff:hasEmploymentStatus, maybe the employment status must be Employee, and there's a requirement that this status is recognized by the agency. Wait, the text says \"nachweisen, dass Sie rechtlich als Arbeitnehmerin oder Arbeitnehmer gelten\" through a decision from the agency. Maybe the user has an EmploymentStatus that's Employee, and the status is somehow linked to the agency's decision. Alternatively, perhaps the user has a triggerEvent that is linked to the agency. Not sure. Maybe the user must have an EmploymentStatus of Employee, and the employment is recognized by the agency. Alternatively, the user must have a triggerEvent (the insolvency event) that is connected via some property to the agency's decision. Since the ontology has ff:triggeringEvent, maybe the triggeringEvent's cause is related? Not sure. Maybe this is a bit ambiguous. The exact ontology property for this might not be present, so I need to check.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the ff:hasEmploymentStatus property links to ff:EmploymentStatus. The possible instances include Employee, SelfEmployed, etc. So the user must have hasEmploymentStatus = ff:Employee. Additionally, the user must have a status that was determined by the agency. Since the agency is ff:FederalEmploymentAgency, perhaps there's a property like ff:recognizedByLaw or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user must have a certificate from the agency, but the ontology doesn't have a property for that. Since the requirement is to prove via the agency's decision, perhaps it's sufficient to have the EmploymentStatus set to Employee and maybe a triggerEvent that is part of a process handled by the agency. Since this might be ambiguous, maybe I can only model the EmploymentStatus part, as the rest might be beyond the ontology's terms.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL:\n\nTarget node is ff:User. The shape should have a sh:targetNode ff:User.\n\nEach condition will be a sh:property with the required constraints.\n\nFirst condition: There must be an event (ff:hasEvent) which is an InsolvencyEvent. But the event can be one of three types. So for the ff:hasEvent property, the value should be an instance of either InsolvencyProceeding (which is a subclass of Event), InsolvencyApplication (with rejectedForLackOfAssets true), or DiscontinuationOfBusiness (with obviousLackOfAssets true). But how to represent this in SHACL?\n\nPerhaps using sh:or with three different shapes. The first shape checks if the event is an InsolvencyProceeding with isOpen true. The second checks if it's an InsolvencyApplication with rejectedForLackOfAssets true. The third checks if it's a DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets true.\n\nSecond condition: The event (from the first condition) must have wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0. So on the event, the wageCutOffsetMonths must be between -3 and 0 inclusive. So a sh:property on the event with sh:minInclusive -3 and sh:maxInclusive 0.\n\nThird condition: The user's employment must be in Germany or, if abroad, still under German social security. The user has an employment (ff:hasEmployment), and for that employment:\n\nEither:\n- countryOfEmployment is Germany, OR\n- countryOfEmployment is not Germany, but socialSecurityCountry is Germany.\n\nWait, the user is \"vorübergehend ins Ausland unter Beibehaltung der Sozialversicherungspflicht in Deutschland entsandt worden.\" So even if the countryOfEmployment is abroad, the socialSecurityCountry must still be Germany. So the countryOfEmployment can be any country, but socialSecurityCountry must be Germany. Wait, maybe the socialSecurityCountry is Germany regardless, but the user is temporarily abroad. Alternatively, the countryOfEmployment can be another country, but the user's socialSecurityCountry remains Germany.\n\nIn the ontology, the ff:socialSecurityCountry is a property of Person. So the user's socialSecurityCountry must be Germany. Additionally, the employment's countryOfEmployment can be any, but the user must be employed in Germany OR temporarily abroad (but socialSecurityCountry is Germany). Wait, maybe the employment's countryOfEmployment is Germany, or the employment is in another country but the user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany. Hmm, but the exact way to model this is important. The requirement is that the user is either employed in Germany OR temporarily sent abroad while maintaining German social security. So:\n\nEither:\n- employment's countryOfEmployment is Germany, OR\n- employment's countryOfEmployment is not Germany AND the user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany.\n\nSo for the employment (ff:hasEmployment), the countryOfEmployment must be Germany OR (countryOfEmployment != Germany AND user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany). But in SHACL, it's tricky to model OR conditions across different properties. Maybe using a sh:or with two shapes:\n\nFirst shape: employment's countryOfEmployment is Germany.\n\nSecond shape: employment's countryOfEmployment is not Germany (but that's not directly possible with SHACL constraints; maybe using sh:hasValue with a NOT, but SHACL doesn't support that directly). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model as:\n\nThe employment's countryOfEmployment can be any, but the user's socialSecurityCountry must be Germany. Because the second part of the condition (temporarily abroad but keeping social security in Germany) would require that the social security country is Germany regardless. So maybe the main requirement is that the user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany. Because if they're abroad but keeping social security, then the country is still Germany. So perhaps the condition is simply that socialSecurityCountry is Germany. Wait, but the first part (employed in Germany) would already have socialSecurityCountry as Germany. Maybe the key point is that the user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany, and the employment is either in Germany or elsewhere. So maybe the employment's countryOfEmployment can be anything, but the user's socialSecurityCountry must be Germany. That might cover both scenarios. Alternatively, perhaps the countryOfEmployment is irrelevant, and the key is the social security. Let me check the requirement again: \"innerhalb Deutschlands beschäftigt oder vorübergehend ins Ausland unter Beibehaltung der Sozialversicherungspflicht in Deutschland entsandt worden.\" So the user is either employed in Germany, or sent abroad but keeping the social security in Germany. Therefore, the socialSecurityCountry must be Germany regardless. So the user's socialSecurityCountry must be Germany. The employment's countryOfEmployment can be Germany or another country, but the user must have socialSecurityCountry as Germany. So in SHACL, user's socialSecurityCountry is Germany.\n\nFourth condition: The user's employment status must be Employee (ff:hasEmploymentStatus = ff:Employee). Additionally, they must have a status determined by the agency. Since the agency is ff:FederalEmploymentAgency, perhaps the user has an EmploymentStatus that is recognized by the agency via ff:recognizedByLaw? Looking at the ontology, ff:recognizedByLaw is a property of Training, not EmploymentStatus. Hmm. Maybe the user's EmploymentStatus is linked to the agency via some other property. Alternatively, the requirement is that the user must have a decision from the agency, but without a specific property in the ontology, perhaps this can't be modeled. Since the user must prove via the agency's decision, maybe the existence of the EmploymentStatus as Employee is sufficient, assuming that the agency's decision is part of that status. Since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for this, I might have to omit this part as ambiguous or not modelable. The problem says not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. So maybe only enforce that the user has EmploymentStatus as Employee.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User would have:\n\n1. A property ff:hasEvent with a sh:or of three conditions (InsolvencyProceeding open, InsolvencyApplication rejected, DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets).\n\n2. That event must have wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0.\n\n3. The user must have socialSecurityCountry as Germany.\n\n4. The user must have hasEmploymentStatus as Employee.\n\n5. The user must have an employment (ff:hasEmployment), but maybe that's already covered by the employment status?\n\nWait, the third part about employment being in Germany or abroad but with social security in Germany: the socialSecurityCountry is Germany, so that's covered. The employment itself might be required via hasEmployment? The condition says \"als Arbeitnehmerin oder Arbeitnehmer sind Sie ... beschäftigt\", so the user must have an employment. So the user must have a hasEmployment.\n\nSo:\n\nAdditional constraints:\n\n- hasEmployment is present (sh:minCount 1).\n\nNow, let's structure each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the shape starts with:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:InsolvencyBenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1: hasEvent must be one of the three types\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; sh:hasValue [ a ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; ff:isOpen true ] ]\n            [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; sh:hasValue [ a ff:InsolvencyApplication ; ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets true ] ]\n            [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; sh:hasValue [ a ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; ff:obviousLackOfAssets true ] ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 2: The event's wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent / ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:integer ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:integer\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 3: Social security country is Germany\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 4: Employment status is Employee\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Employee\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Ensure the user has an employment\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount \"1\"^^xsd:integer\n    ] .\n\nWait, but for condition 1, the sh:or is on the ff:hasEvent property, and each item in the or must be a shape that the event must satisfy. So each of the three options must be an instance of the correct class with the correct property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each alternative is a separate shape, but I think the way I wrote it is okay. However, in SHACL, when using sh:class, the value must be an instance of that class. So for the first option, the event must be an InsolvencyProceeding and have isOpen true.\n\nWait, the first part of condition 1 is \"Eröffnung eines Insolvenzverfahrens über das Vermögen Ihres Arbeitgebers\" which is the opening of an insolvency proceeding. So the event must be an InsolvencyProceeding with isOpen true (assuming that an open proceeding is the event here). The second is \"Insolvenzantrag wird mangels Masse abgewiesen\" which is the InsolvencyApplication being rejected for lack of assets (so rejectedForLackOfAssets=true). The third is \"Betriebstätigkeit wird bei offensichtlicher Masselosigkeit vollständig eingestellt\" which is DiscontinuationOfBusiness with obviousLackOfAssets=true.\n\nSo each of the three alternatives must be an instance of their respective classes with the respective properties.\n\nSo for the first alternative:\n\n[ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:isOpen ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\nWait, maybe better to use sh:property for the isOpen property. Let me adjust:\n\nThe first alternative is an event that is an InsolvencyProceeding and has isOpen true:\n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:hasEvent ] ; sh:hasValue ff:User ] ; but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, the shape for the event must be a subclass and have the property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each alternative in sh:or is a shape that the event must conform to. So:\n\nFirst alternative shape:\n\n[ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n  sh:property [ sh:path ff:isOpen ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\nSecond alternative:\n\n[ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n  sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\nThird alternative:\n\n[ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n  sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\nTherefore, the first sh:or would be:\n\nsh:or (\n    [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:isOpen ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n    [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n)\n\nBut in SHACL, when using sh:or on a property, each item in the or is a shape that the value must conform to. So the ff:hasEvent property's value (the event instance) must match one of the three shapes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNext, the wageCutOffsetMonths on the event must be between -3 and 0. The path is ff:hasEvent/ff:wageCutOffsetMonths.\n\nThen, the socialSecurityCountry must be Germany.\n\nEmployment status must be Employee.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have an employment (hasEmployment exists).\n\nWait, the condition says \"als Arbeitnehmerin oder Arbeitnehmer sind Sie ... beschäftigt\" which implies that the user has an employment. So the hasEmployment must exist (sh:minCount 1).\n\nPutting this all together, the SHACL should look like this:\n\nI need to ensure that the Turtle syntax is correct, using prefixes properly.\n\nAlso, the SocialBenefit's ID is B100019_LB_576848. The ontology doesn't list this, but the user provided it in the text. Since the ontology has ff:B100019_LB_576842 for Arbeitslosengeld, maybe the Insolvenzgeld has the given ID. But in the SHACL, the shapes are for validation, so perhaps the user's eligibility is determined by meeting the conditions, and the benefit is linked via isEligibleFor. But the SHACL shape's purpose is to validate the user's data for eligibility, so the shape itself doesn't need to reference the benefit's ID unless required. Since the problem says the graph must target ff:User, the shape's target is correct.\n\nNow, writing the Turtle code:\n\n```\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:InsolvencyBenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Condition 1: Insolvenzereignis vorliegen\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:isOpen ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            )\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Condition 2: wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent / ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:integer ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:integer\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Condition 3: socialSecurityCountry is Germany\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Condition 4: Employment status is Employee\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Employee\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Ensure there is an employment\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount \"1\"^^xsd:integer\n    ] .\n```\n\nWait, but the wageCutOffsetMonths is a property of the event, so the path should be ff:hasEvent followed by ff:wageCutOffsetMonths. So the path is ff:hasEvent / ff:wageCutOffsetMonths.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nNow, check if all conditions are covered:\n\n- The three types of insolvency events are covered via the sh:or.\n\n- The wageCutOffsetMonths between -3 and 0.\n\n- Social security country Germany.\n\n- Employment status is Employee.\n\n- Employment exists.\n\nThe fourth condition about proving via the agency's decision is omitted because there's no property in the ontology to represent that. The user must have EmploymentStatus as Employee, which might be sufficient if that status is determined by the agency. Since the ontology's hasEmploymentStatus links to EmploymentStatus instances like Employee, which is correct.\n\nSo this should be the correct SHACL.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:InsolvencyBenefitShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n\n    # Bedingung 1: Insolvenzereignis vorliegen\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:or (\n            # Eröffnung eines Insolvenzverfahrens\n            [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:isOpen ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            # Insolvenzantrag abgelehnt wegen Mangel an Masse\n            [ sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n            # Betriebstätigkeit wegen Mangel an Masse eingestellt\n            [ sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:obviousLackOfAssets ; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n        )\n    ] ;\n\n    # Bedingung 2: Kein Lohn für bis zu 3 Monate vor Ereignis\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent / ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"-3\"^^xsd:integer ;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"0\"^^xsd:integer\n    ] ;\n\n    # Bedingung 3: Sozialversicherung in Deutschland\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Germany\n    ] ;\n\n    # Bedingung 4: Beschäftigung als Arbeitnehmer\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Employee\n    ] ;\n\n    # Mindestens eine Beschäftigung existiert\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount \"1\"^^xsd:integer\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (B100019_LB_582429) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user must be eligible for this benefit if they are unfit for work due to an insurance event. The insurance events include work accidents, commuting accidents, and occupational diseases.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the SocialBenefit individual is B100019_LB_582429. The user node is ff:User. The key properties needed here are related to earning capacity and the type of event.\n\nThe user must have an earning capacity that is 'UnfitForWork' (ff:UnfitForWork). This is checked via ff:hasEarningCapacity. Then, there must be an event (ff:hasEvent) that is one of the allowed types: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nAdditionally, the event must be the cause of the user's inability to work. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent which links earning capacity to an event. So the earning capacity's triggering event must be one of those three event types.\n\nI need to structure the SHACL shape for ff:User. The shape should have constraints:\n\n1. The user must have an earning capacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity) that is exactly ff:UnfitForWork.\n2. That earning capacity must have a triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent) which is an instance of one of the allowed event classes (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease).\n\nWait, in SHACL, to check the type of the event, I can use sh:class with sh:hasValue and sh:or to allow multiple classes.\n\nLet me check the ontology again for the classes:\n\n- WorkAccident is a subclass of Event.\n- CommutingAccident is a subclass of Event.\n- OccupationalDisease is a subclass of Event.\n\nSo the event must be an instance of one of these three. Therefore, the sh:class should have sh:or with each of these classes.\n\nAlso, the triggering event must be linked via the trigger from the earning capacity. So the path is ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent.\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nThe shape for the user would have a property path ff:hasEarningCapacity / a [shape that ensures it's UnfitForWork and has the correct triggering event].\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into two shapes: one for the earning capacity and another for the event.\n\nWait, perhaps the main shape for ff:User requires that the earning capacity is UnfitForWork and that the triggering event is of the right type.\n\nWait, the earning capacity itself must be exactly UnfitForWork. Then, the triggering event of that earning capacity must be one of the allowed events.\n\nSo first, the earning capacity must be exactly UnfitForWork:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity;\n  sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork;\n]\n\nThen, another property for the triggering event:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:triggeringEvent ];  // Wait, maybe better to express as the path from earning capacity to triggering event.\n\nWait, the earning capacity (instance of EarningCapacity) has a triggeringEvent. So the path would be:\n\nff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent.\n\nBut the user has ff:hasEarningCapacity pointing to the EarningCapacity node. Then, that node must have a ff:triggeringEvent whose type is one of the allowed events.\n\nAlternatively, in SHACL, to check the type of the object at the end of the path, we can use sh:class.\n\nWait, the path would be ff:hasEarningCapacity/ff:triggeringEvent, and the class of the resulting node must be one of the allowed event classes.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:inversePath [ sh:sequence ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ] ];\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n]\n\nWait, no, inversePath might not be needed here. Let me think again.\n\nThe user must have an earning capacity (via hasEarningCapacity), and that earning capacity must have a triggering event (via triggeringEvent). So the path is ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent. The target of this path must be an instance of one of the three event types.\n\nTherefore:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n]\n\nBut in SHACL, the path is from the user to the event via those properties. Wait, no: the user has a hasEarningCapacity that points to an EarningCapacity instance. Then, that EarningCapacity has a triggeringEvent that points to the event. So the path from user to event is indeed hasEarningCapacity followed by triggeringEvent. Thus, the path is correct.\n\nAdditionally, the triggeringEvent must exist. So we can require that this path has a value, using sh:minCount 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape for ff:User would have:\n\n- hasEarningCapacity must be exactly UnfitForWork.\n- The triggeringEvent on that earning capacity must be an instance of the allowed event types.\n\nWait, but the first condition (hasEarningCapacity being UnfitForWork) is about the value of hasEarningCapacity. So the first property constraint is:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity;\n  sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork;\n]\n\nThen the second property constraint is:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:sequence ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ];\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nWait, but the path here is ff:hasEarningCapacity followed by ff:triggeringEvent. The resulting node (the event) must be of one of those classes, and there must be at least one such event.\n\nSo that's the main structure.\n\nAre there any other constraints? The original text says \"if they are unfit for work due to an insurance event\". The insurance event must be one of the listed types, and the earning capacity must be caused by that event.\n\nI think that's covered.\n\nNow, check if all terms are from the ontology. The properties and classes used are:\n\n- ff:hasEarningCapacity (yes, in the ontology)\n- ff:triggeringEvent (yes, in ontology's domain includes EarningCapacity)\n- ff:WorkAccident (yes)\n- ff:CommutingAccident (yes)\n- ff:OccupationalDisease (yes)\n- ff:UnfitForWork (yes)\n\nYes, all terms are present.\n\nNow, serializing this in Turtle.\n\nThe SHACL graph should start with the shape for the targetClass ff:User.\n\nThe shape node can be something like ff:UserShape.\n\nSo:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity(ff:triggeringEvent) ;\n    sh:class [ \n      sh:or ( \n        ff:WorkAccident \n        ff:CommutingAccident \n        ff:OccupationalDisease \n      )\n    ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n  ] .\n\nWait, in SHACL, the path can be written using the shorthand notation ff:hasEarningCapacity / ff:triggeringEvent. Alternatively, using the sequence operator.\n\nAlternatively, using the path expression as:\n\nsh:path [ sh:sequence ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ]\n\nBut in Turtle, the syntax might be:\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:sequence ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ] ;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n  ] .\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI need to make sure that the SHACL is valid. The class constraint uses sh:or with the three classes. The path correctly goes from the user through hasEarningCapacity to the EarningCapacity, then triggeringEvent to the event.\n\nThis should enforce that the user has an earning capacity of UnfitForWork and that there's a triggering event of the correct type.\n\nI don't see any other conditions in the description. The user must be unfit for work due to one of the allowed events. The SHACL rules capture both requirements.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ;  # Unfit for work due to event\n  ] ;\n\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:sequence ( ff:hasEarningCapacity ff:triggeringEvent ) ] ; \n    sh:class [\n      sh:or ( \n        ff:WorkAccident \n        ff:CommutingAccident \n        ff:OccupationalDisease \n      )\n    ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;  # Must have at least one qualifying event\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the given social benefit. The benefit in question is the 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' with the ID LB L100040_LB_8664880. The user provided the ontology and the benefit's requirements, so I need to translate those into SHACL constraints targeting the ff:User node.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the requirements step by step.\n\nThe eligibility conditions are:\n\n1. The person must be in need (bedürftig), meaning they can't cover their basic needs from income and assets. The ontology has a data property ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit which should be false.\n\n2. They must have reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII. The ontology has ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit which should be true.\n\nOR one of the following:\n\n- They are 18+ and permanently fully work-reduced (erwerbsminderung). The ontology has ff:hasAge >= 18, and a disability that reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently is true and ff:severeDisability is true? Wait, the requirement says \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI\". The ontology has EarningCapacity with ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently. So maybe the person's earning capacity is of type ReducedEarningCapacity with that property true, and the disability's severity? Hmm. Wait, the requirement says \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert\", which would mean their earning capacity is permanently reduced to 0? Not sure, but looking at the ontology, maybe ff:EarningCapacity has ff:reductionInPercent 100% and ff:permanent is true? Or perhaps the EarningCapacity is of type UnfitForWork (since there's an individual UnfitForWork under EarningCapacity). Let me check the ontology. Yes, there's an individual ff:UnfitForWork which is a type of EarningCapacity. So maybe the person's hasEarningCapacity must be UnfitForWork, and they are over 18.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement says \"dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI\". The ontology's ff:EarningCapacity has a property ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently. So perhaps the earning capacity must have that set to true, and the reduction is 100%? Or maybe the EarningCapacity is of type UnfitForWork (which is a sub-class of EarningCapacity), which might imply that.\n\nWait, in the ontology, there's an individual ff:UnfitForWork of type EarningCapacity. So if the person's ff:hasEarningCapacity is linked to UnfitForWork, that might satisfy the \"voll erwerbsgemindert\". Also, the age must be over 18 (ff:hasAge >= 18).\n\nOR\n\n- They are 18+ and either in the entry procedure and vocational training area (Eingangsverfahren und Berufsbildungsbereich) at a workshop for disabled or similar, or in a training relationship with a training budget. The ontology has the class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea which is a subclass of Training. Also, the training should be commissioned by the employment agency (commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true?) or have a training budget. Wait the text says \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\" So the training must be part of a training budget. The ontology has a social benefit called ff:TrainingBudget. Hmm, perhaps the training has a ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract, and maybe the training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true? Or there's a link to the training budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is participating in a training that is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. The ontology has that class. So the person must have ff:participates linked to a training of that type, or a training that is subject to a contract (maybe via ff:subjectToContract) and has a training budget.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"durchlaufen\" (completed?) or \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen\" (in a training relationship). The ontology's ff:participates links to a Training they are currently in. So maybe the user must be participating in a Training that is an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or in a training that is part of a training budget. Alternatively, maybe the training has a ff:triggeringEvent or another property. Hmm, perhaps the training is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, so the person must have ff:participates linked to such a Training.\n\nAdditionally, the user must be 18+ (ff:hasAge >=18).\n\nNow, the Social Assistance (Sozialhilfe) is a secondary benefit, so the person must not have priority claims. The ontology has a property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver which links to the benefit. So the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to this benefit, indicating no priority claims. Alternatively, the user must have no other benefits with higher priority. Since it's a SHACL validation, perhaps the user must not have any ff:receivesBenefit or ff:isEligibleFor benefits that have higher priority. But modeling that might be complex. Alternatively, the requirement says that third-party claims (like alimony) must be pursued first. Since SHACL can't check that directly unless there's a property indicating that those claims are not met. The text says \"werden sie nicht rechtzeitig erfüllt und muss deswegen die Sozialhilfe eintreten...\" So perhaps the user must have no unfulfilled third-party claims? Not sure how to model that. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, so maybe the user must have that property set to true for this benefit. Wait, the ontology's ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is a object property linking to the SocialBenefit, but the range is SocialBenefit. So maybe the user must have a triple like user ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver this benefit (ff:L100040_LB_8664880). Wait, the benefit's ID is given as LB L100040_LB_8664880. Looking back at the ontology, there's an individual ff:L100040_LB_8665924 which is Wohngeld, but the target is different. The user must have the specific SocialBenefit instance for this benefit. Wait, the problem says \"Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' mit der IDLB L100040_LB_8664880\". So that's probably the URI for the benefit. Since it's not listed in the ontology's individuals, maybe it's a typo? The ontology has ff:L100040_LB_8665924 as Wohngeld, but the target is different. Maybe the correct individual is not present, but the user can still reference it as a node. Alternatively, maybe the benefit is SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance), but the text says \"Grundsicherung\" which is the base security, but in the ontology, SocialAssistance is listed. Alternatively, perhaps the benefit is a new individual not listed, but since we can't invent terms, maybe we have to use the existing SocialAssistance. Wait the problem states that the benefit is 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung', which is a type of Sozialhilfe (Social Assistance). The ontology has ff:SocialAssistance as a SocialBenefit. So perhaps the target is ff:SocialAssistance. But the given ID is different. Hmm, maybe the ontology's SocialAssistance corresponds to this benefit. Alternatively, maybe the user must have the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver to the specific benefit (the one with the given ID). Since the ontology doesn't have that individual, but the task says \"do not invent terms outside the ontology\", perhaps we have to use existing ones. Alternatively, maybe the benefit is SocialAssistance, so the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo in the individual's name. Let me check the ontology again. The individual ff:L100040_LB_8665924 is Wohngeld. The target is L100040_LB_8664880. Not listed. Since the ontology doesn't have that, maybe it's an error, but the user must use existing terms. Since the benefit is called Grundsicherung (which is Sozialhilfe), maybe the correct individual is ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe user must satisfy one of the three conditions (age, disability, or training) plus the basic needs condition and no priority claims.\n\nSo the SHACL shape will have a disjunction of the three conditions.\n\nStructure:\n\n- Target node is ff:User.\n\nThe shape will have constraints:\n\n1. ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be false.\n\n2. AND (one of the three conditions):\n\nEither:\n\na) ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit is true.\n\nOR\n\nb) (ff:hasAge >= 18) AND (their earning capacity is UnfitForWork (i.e., ff:hasEarningCapacity is ff:UnfitForWork) )\n\nOR\n\nc) (ff:hasAge >= 18) AND ( they participate in a Training of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or in a training with a budget (maybe ff:TrainingBudget as a property? Not sure. The ontology's Training class has ff:subjectToContract which could link to VocationalTrainingContract. The requirement mentions \"Budget für Ausbildung erhalten\" which might be ff:TrainingBudget as a SocialBenefit. So maybe the Training has a ff:subjectToContract to VocationalTrainingContract, and also has a ff:triggeringEvent or something else. Alternatively, the Training is commissioned by the employment agency (ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true). The ontology has a data property ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training. So condition c) could be that they are participating in a Training where ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true, or the Training is of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"durchlaufen\" (completed?) or \"in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen\" (in a training relationship with a budget). So maybe the Training must be of type EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea (since that's a subclass of Training). So the user must have a participates link to an instance of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, or to a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Training must be commissioned by the employment agency (FederalEmploymentAgency?), so the Training has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true. Since the property is a data property on Training, setting it to true would indicate that.\n\nSo condition c) would be:\n\n(ff:participates some [ a ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] ) OR (ff:participates some [ ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true ] )\n\nBut how to model this in SHACL? SHACL has a disjunction with sh:or, so each condition can be a separate constraint component.\n\nAdditionally, the user must be over 18 in all three cases except the first (age limit). Wait no, the first condition (age limit) is separate. The second and third require age over 18.\n\nNow, the Sozialhilfe being a secondary benefit requires that the user has no priority claims. The ontology's ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver links to the SocialBenefit. So the user must have a ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to this benefit (the specific one, but since it's not in ontology, perhaps the existing SocialAssistance is the right one). Let me check the ontology again: the individual ff:SocialAssistance is a SocialBenefit. The requirement says \"Sozialhilfe ist eine nachrangige Leistung\", so the benefit in question is SocialAssistance. Therefore, the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to ff:SocialAssistance. Wait, no, the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver links a person to a social benefit if they have no priority claims over it. So if the benefit they're applying for is this one, then they must not have any priority claims that would supersede it. Alternatively, the user must not have any other benefits with higher priority. But modeling that is tricky. Alternatively, the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver property should indicate that there are no priority claims over this benefit. But since the property's range is SocialBenefit, maybe the user must have a triple like ff:User ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ff:SocialAssistance (if the benefit is SocialAssistance). But the exact benefit's individual isn't in the ontology. Since the problem states the benefit's ID is L100040_LB_8664880, but it's not in the ontology, perhaps it's an error. Alternatively, the user must have no priority claims for any other benefits, but that's hard to model. Maybe the correct approach is to use the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver property with the benefit in question, but since it's not in the ontology, perhaps we have to omit that part. Wait the problem says \"do not invent terms outside the ontology\", so we can't make up a new individual. Maybe the benefit is SocialAssistance. Let me proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the shape must include:\n\n- The user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to the benefit (ff:SocialAssistance).\n\nWait, the user is applying for this benefit, so the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver would link to this benefit, meaning they have no priority claims over it. But if the benefit is SocialAssistance, then the user must have that property. Alternatively, perhaps the user must not be eligible for any higher-priority benefits, but that would require checking other properties, which might not be possible. Since the ontology has the ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver property, we can use that. Assuming the benefit is SocialAssistance, the user must have a triple like user ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ff:SocialAssistance, but that might not be right. Alternatively, the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver links the person to the benefit for which they are applying (the target benefit), indicating they have no priority claims over it. Since the target is the Grundsicherung (SocialAssistance?), the user must have that property set for that benefit. But without the exact URI, perhaps it's better to use the existing SocialAssistance. Alternatively, maybe the property is a flag, but it's an object property. Hmm, perhaps this part is ambiguous. The requirement says \"third parties' claims must be pursued first\". Since SHACL can't model that unless there's a property indicating that those claims are not met, maybe this part is not modelable and should be excluded. The user instruction says not to model ambiguous requirements. Since the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver exists, perhaps it's required. So assuming that the user must have ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to the benefit (even if the exact URI is missing, but using SocialAssistance as the existing one), proceed with that.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL:\n\nThe shape will target ff:User. It should have a sh:and with the basic needs condition and the disjunction of the three conditions, plus the no priority claims.\n\nLet me outline the constraints:\n\n1. Basic needs: ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit = false\n\n2. Disjunction (sh:or) between:\n\n   a) ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit = true\n\n   b) (ff:hasAge >= 18) AND (ff:hasEarningCapacity = ff:UnfitForWork)\n\n   c) (ff:hasAge >= 18) AND [ (participates in EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) OR (participates in a Training where commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true) ]\n\nWait, for condition c), the user must be participating in either an EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or in a Training that is commissioned by the employment agency. So in SHACL:\n\nThe path for participates is ff:participates, and the target must be a instance of either EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or have the commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true.\n\nSo for the SHACL condition:\n\nEither:\n\n- ff:participates some [ a ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n\nOR\n\n- ff:participates some [ ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true ]\n\nSo combining these, the shape for condition c is:\n\nsh:or ( [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n] [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue true;\n    sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency\n] )\n\nBut wait, the second part would require that the participates' object has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true. To express that, perhaps:\n\n[ sh:path ff:participates;\n  sh:someValuesFrom [ a sh:NodeShape;\n    sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency; sh:hasValue true ]\n  ]\n]\n\nYes, that's better. So the c condition's shape is a node shape that requires participates to link to a node that either is EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe SHACL will have a shape for the User with:\n\nsh:targetNode ff:User\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit;\n    sh:hasValue false;\n]\n\nsh:and [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit; sh:hasValue true ] ]\n\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ],\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity; sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ] ]\n        ) ]\n\n        [ sh:and (\n            [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ],\n            [ sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:participates; sh:someValuesFrom [ a sh:NodeShape; sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] ] ],\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:participates; sh:someValuesFrom [ a sh:NodeShape; sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency; sh:hasValue true ] ] ] ]\n            ) ]\n        ) ]\n    )\n]\n\nAND also the no priority claims:\n\n[ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver; sh:minCount 1; sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ] ]\n\nWait, the ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver is an object property, so the user must have at least one triple where the object is the benefit. Assuming the benefit is SocialAssistance (ff:SocialAssistance), then the constraint would be:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance;\n]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a flag, but according to the ontology, it's an object property to the SocialBenefit. So yes.\n\nPutting all together, the full SHACL shape would look like this.\n\nNow, checking the requirements again for any missed points:\n\n- The user must not have priority claims over this benefit, so the hasNoPriorityClaimsOver to the benefit (SocialAssistance).\n\n- The three conditions are ORed.\n\n- The age checks are in place.\n\n- The training conditions are correctly modeled.\n\nI think that covers everything. Now, coding this into Turtle.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf:   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sh:    <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff:    <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# Shape for validating User eligibility for 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung'\n<https://foerderfunke.org/default#UserShape> a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:and (\n        # Disjunction of eligibility conditions\n        [\n            sh:or (\n                # Condition A: Age limit reached\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ; sh:hasValue true ] ] \n                \n                # Condition B: 18+ and permanently unfit for work\n                [ sh:and (\n                    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ],\n                    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ; sh:hasValue ff:UnfitForWork ] ]\n                ) ]\n                \n                # Condition C: 18+ and in qualifying training\n                [ sh:and (\n                    [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ],\n                    [ sh:or (\n                        # Training is EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\n                        [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:participates ; sh:someValuesFrom [ a sh:NodeShape ; sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] ] ],\n                        \n                        # Training is commissioned by employment agency\n                        [ sh:property [ \n                            sh:path ff:participates ;\n                            sh:someValuesFrom [ \n                                a sh:NodeShape ;\n                                sh:property [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ; sh:hasValue true ] \n                            ]\n                        ] ]\n                    ) ]\n                ) ]\n            )\n        ]\n        \n        # Secondary benefit condition: no priority claims\n        [\n            sh:property [ \n                sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ; \n                sh:minCount 1 ; \n                sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance \n            ]\n        ]\n    ) .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the eligibility requirements of the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld' social benefit. Let's start by understanding the conditions given.\n\nThe benefit requires four main criteria:\n\n1. The user must be supervising, caring for, or nursing a child from their household due to the consequences of an insurance event (school or kindergarten accident).\n2. The child has not yet turned 12.\n3. The user had a claim to wages or another financial benefit (like sick pay, unemployment benefit) before starting the care.\n4. No other household member can care for the child.\n\nFirst, I'll map these to the ontology provided. The user is ff:User, so the SHACL shape must target that node. Let's go through each condition.\n\nCondition 1: The user must be caring for their household child due to a school/kindergarten accident. The ontology has ff:receivesChildBenefitFor which links a person to a child. But maybe the user is the caregiver, so perhaps the child must be in their household. The ff:sameHouseholdAs property connects people in the same household. But the key is that the child is part of the user's household. However, the exact property for 'household' might be needed here. Wait, the user has to be the one caring for the child. The ff:caregiverInHousehold is an object property from CareNeed to Person, but maybe the CareNeed is linked to the child. Alternatively, the accident (as an Event) must be of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. The user must have a child (ff:hasChild) and that child's accident caused the need for care.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a child (via ff:hasChild), and the child has an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) linked via ff:hasEvent. But how to express that the user is taking care of the child because of that event?\n\nAlternatively, the user's child (ff:hasChild) has an accident (Event) which is a School or Kindergarten Accident. The user must be the one providing care. Maybe the user has an ff:caregiverInHousehold link, but that's from CareNeed to Person. Hmm, the CareNeed is linked to the person needing care (the child), so the CareNeed would be attached to the child, and the caregiver is the user. So the user must be the caregiverInHousehold of the child's CareNeed, which is caused by an accident. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user has a child (ff:hasChild) who has an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident), and the user is responsible for their care. Maybe the user must have an employment or income that is affected because they now have to care for the child. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have an ff:hasEvent that is the accident, but the accident must be linked to the child. \n\nThis part is a bit tricky. Let me see the ontology again. \n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:CareNeed is a subclass of Event, so maybe the CareNeed is an event that the child has. The user must be the caregiverInHousehold for that CareNeed. The CareNeed must be caused by an accident (School or Kindergarten). \n\nSo, for condition 1, the SHACL shape would require:\n\n- The user has a child (ff:hasChild ?child).\n- The child has a CareNeed (ff:needsCare ?careNeed), where ?careNeed is an instance of CareNeed.\n- The CareNeed has a cause (triggering event?) which is an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n- The CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user (ff:caregiverInHousehold ff:User).\n  \nAlternatively, the CareNeed must be caused by an Event that is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. The user is the caregiver for that CareNeed. \n\nSo, in SHACL, how do I express this? Maybe using sh:hasValue for the event types. \n\nAlternatively, the event must be of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. So, for the CareNeed's triggering event, it must be one of those. \n\nThis seems complex, perhaps using sh:property with path ff:triggeringEvent and sh:class to specify the accident types. \n\nCondition 2: The child has not yet turned 12. The child's age is tracked via ff:hasAge, so the child's age must be less than 12. So the user's child (ff:hasChild) must have ff:hasAge < 12. \n\nCondition 3: The user had a claim to wages or another benefit before starting the care. The 'before' part is tricky. The ontology has ff:triggeringEvent for EarningCapacity. Maybe the user's earning capacity was affected by the accident. Alternatively, the user had an employment (ff:hasEmployment) or received a benefit like unemployment benefit before the accident. \n\nLooking at the data properties, there's ff:triggeringEvent which is for EarningCapacity or OccupationalRehabilitation. The user's EarningCapacity might have a triggeringEvent which is the accident. But maybe the user had an employment before the event. The user's ff:inEmployment was true before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an event (the accident) that caused a loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true). The user must have had an earning capacity before the event. \n\nWait, the condition states that before the care started, the user had a claim to wages or another benefit. So, perhaps the user had an EmploymentStatus before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an ff:Employment before the accident, and now they can't work because they have to care for the child. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an ff:hasEmploymentStatus that was Employee or something else before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause links to a Disability, but that might not fit here. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have had an ff:inEmployment true before the accident. \n\nHmm, perhaps the user's ff:hasEmployment must exist, and the employment was before the accident. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the accident caused a loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true on the event). \n\nAlternatively, the user had an ff:EarningCapacity before the accident. \n\nThe exact property is unclear. Let me see the ontology again. \n\nThe ff:triggeringEvent for EarningCapacity could be the accident. The user's EarningCapacity was triggered by the event (the accident), which caused a reduction. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an ff:EarningCapacity before the accident. \n\nWait, the condition says \"had a claim to wages or another financial benefit (like sick pay, unemployment benefit)\". So maybe the user had an employment or was receiving a benefit like unemployment benefit before they had to care for the child. \n\nThe ff:receivedBenefit property links a person to a benefit they received in the past. So, the user must have received (for example) unemployment benefit (ff:B100019_LB_576842) before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an ff:Employment before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user's ff:hasEmploymentStatus before the accident was something like Employee, but now it's changed. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to require that the user had an ff:EarningCapacity before the accident, and that this was affected by the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have had an ff:Employment before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the accident caused a loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true on the event). \n\nSo, perhaps the accident (School or KindergartenAccident) has ff:causesLossOfEarnings set to true. \n\nCondition 4: No other household member can care for the child. So the user must be the only caregiver in the household. \n\nThe ff:caregiverInHousehold is from CareNeed to Person. So, for the child's CareNeed, the caregiver must be the user, and there are no others. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have no other household members (ff:sameHouseholdAs) who can provide care. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is only the user. \n\nBut how to model \"no other in household can care\". Maybe the CareNeed has exactly one caregiverInHousehold, which is the user. \n\nAlternatively, the user must not have any other person in the household (ff:sameHouseholdAs) who is linked as a caregiverInHousehold for the CareNeed. \n\nThis could be tricky. Maybe using sh:zeroOrOne with sh:hasValue the user. \n\nAlternatively, using a SPARQL-based constraint, but the task specifies to use SHACL Core, so SPARQL isn't allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nPutting this all together in SHACL shapes. \n\nThe shape will target ff:User. \n\nLet me outline each condition as SHACL constraints:\n\nCondition 1:\n\n- The user must have a child (ff:hasChild ?child).\n- The child has a CareNeed (ff:needsCare ?careNeed).\n- The CareNeed is caused by a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. \n- The CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is the user.\n\nWait, the CareNeed is an event, and caregiverInHousehold is an object property from CareNeed to Person. So:\n\nThe user must be the caregiverInHousehold of the CareNeed. \n\nSo, the CareNeed must have ff:caregiverInHousehold = ff:User.\n\nBut the CareNeed must be caused by an accident of the right type. \n\nThe CareNeed's triggering event must be the accident. Wait, the CareNeed is an event itself, but its cause might be another event. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's triggeringEvent is the accident. \n\nWait, looking at the ontology, the ff:triggeringEvent is a property for EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. Not for CareNeed. \n\nHmm. Maybe the CareNeed is directly an instance of the accident. Wait, CareNeed is a subclass of Event, so maybe the CareNeed is the accident itself? No, the CareNeed is about needing care because of an accident. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed is caused by the accident. \n\nPerhaps the accident (School or KindergartenAccident) is the cause of the CareNeed. \n\nBut how to express that. Maybe the CareNeed has a property linking to the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's type must be related to the accident. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I can structure the conditions as follows:\n\n1. The user has a child (ff:hasChild ?child).\n2. The child has an event (ff:hasEvent ?event) which is either a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n3. The user is the caregiver for the child's care need (ff:caregiverInHousehold ?careNeed where ?careNeed is a CareNeed related to the accident).\n   \nAlternatively, the CareNeed must be linked to the accident event. Maybe via some property, but perhaps it's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed is a CareNeed event that is caused by the accident. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accident is the triggering event for the CareNeed. \n\nBut without a direct link in the ontology between CareNeed and the accident, this might be hard. \n\nMaybe the simplest way is to require that the CareNeed is of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. But CareNeed is a subclass of Event, so those accident types are subclasses of Event. \n\nWait, SchoolAccident and KindergartenAccident are subclasses of Event. So the CareNeed's type should be one of those? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the CareNeed is the consequence of an accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident) that is the cause of the child's care need. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me try to write the SHACL for each condition step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be a caregiver for their child's CareNeed caused by an accident. \n\nThe user must have a child (ff:hasChild ?child). So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nThen, that child must have a CareNeed (ff:needsCare ?careNeed). \n\nBut in SHACL, how to express that the user's child has a CareNeed? Since SHACL shapes can have constraints on properties that are objects, but here it's nested. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have a child who has a CareNeed. So the path would be ff:hasChild / ff:needsCare. \n\nWait, SHACL allows path chains. So for the user to have a child with a CareNeed, the path would be ff:hasChild//ff:needsCare (using the inverse path?), but I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, the user has a child (ff:hasChild), and that child has a CareNeed (ff:needsCare). \n\nSo, the user must have at least one child that has a CareNeed. \n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n    ]\n];\n\nBut also, that CareNeed must be caused by a School or Kindergarten Accident. \n\nHmm, perhaps the CareNeed's triggering event is the accident. But I'm not sure which property links CareNeed to its cause. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed must be an instance of a type that's a consequence of such accidents. Since CareNeed is a subclass of Event, maybe the CareNeed is the accident itself. But that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the accident must be the causeOf the CareNeed. \n\nWait, the ontology has ff:causeOfDeath, which links a person to an event that caused their death. Maybe there's a general cause property, but I don't see it. \n\nAlternatively, the accident is the triggeringEvent for the CareNeed, but the ontology doesn't list that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the CareNeed is the consequence, so the accident is the trigger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the CareNeed has an ff:triggeringEvent which is an instance of SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. \n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:triggeringEvent is a property of EarningCapacity and OccupationalRehabilitation. Not CareNeed. So that's not applicable here. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe the accident is linked to the child via hasEvent. \n\nThe child has an event (SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident), and that's why they need care. \n\nSo, the child (ff:hasChild ?child) must have an event (ff:hasEvent ?accident) where ?accident is a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident. \n\nAdditionally, the user is the caregiver for the child's care need. \n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nCondition 1:\n\nThe user has a child (ff:hasChild ?child).\n\nThe child has an event (ff:hasEvent ?accident) of type SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident.\n\nThe user must be the caregiver for the child's CareNeed. \n\nThe CareNeed is linked to the child via ff:needsCare, and the caregiver is the user via ff:caregiverInHousehold.\n\nThus, the CareNeed (from child's needsCare) must have a caregiverInHousehold of the user.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\nWait, but the user is ff:User, but in SHACL, you can't use the user as a value. Wait, the target is ff:User, so the shape is on the user node. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the user. So in the CareNeed's triple, the caregiverInHousehold points to the user. \n\nIn SHACL, to express that for the CareNeed (which is the object of needsCare on the child), the caregiverInHousehold must be the user. \n\nSo, in SHACL:\n\nFor the user's child (ff:hasChild ?child), the child's CareNeed (ff:needsCare ?careNeed) must have ff:caregiverInHousehold equal to the user. \n\nSince SHACL is about the user's data, the user's node must have a path that leads to that condition. \n\nAlternatively, the shape on the user must have a property that enforces this via a path. \n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should proceed with the conditions as much as possible, even if some parts are approximated.\n\nCondition 1:\n\nThe user must have a child who has a School or Kindergarten Accident, and the user is the caregiver for that child's CareNeed.\n\nSo:\n\nUser hasChild ?child.\n\n?child hasEvent ?accident (a SchoolAccident or KindergartenAccident).\n\n?child needsCare ?careNeed.\n\n?careNeed caregiverInHousehold User.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nThe user must have at least one child with such an event and care need.\n\nSo in SHACL:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;  # but the User is the target, so this may not be correct syntax\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\nWait, the 'hasValue' is a problem because the User is the target node, so the path for caregiverInHousehold must point back to the user. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be the same as the User. Since the shape is on the User node, perhaps using a SPARQL constraint would be better, but the task requires SHACL Core. \n\nHmm, perhaps this part needs to be modeled differently. Maybe the user has a relationship where they are the caregiver in the household for the child's care need. \n\nAlternatively, the user has a CareNeed (but the CareNeed is about the child, not the user). \n\nAlternatively, the user has an ff:caregiverInHousehold link to the CareNeed. \n\nWait, the CareNeed is the domain of ff:caregiverInHousehold, so the CareNeed points to the caregiver. \n\nThus, the CareNeed (which is an object of the child's needsCare) must have a caregiverInHousehold that is the user. \n\nIn SHACL, to enforce this, the path from the user's child's CareNeed to caregiverInHousehold must be the user. \n\nBut in SHACL Core, this requires a chain of properties. The path would be:\n\nff:hasChild / ff:needsCare / ff:caregiverInHousehold \n\nmust equal the user. \n\nBut how to express that? \n\nPerhaps:\n\nThe user must have a child, and for that child's CareNeed, the caregiverInHousehold is the user.\n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n        ];\n    ]\n];\n\nBut the 'sh:hasValue' here would check if the caregiverInHousehold of the CareNeed is exactly the User. \n\nThat seems feasible. \n\nSo combining with the accident part:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\nThis would ensure that the user has at least one child who has the required accident and the CareNeed's caregiver is the user. \n\nMoving to Condition 2: The child has not yet turned 12. \n\nThe child's ff:hasAge must be less than 12. \n\nSo, for each child the user has, the age must be <12. \n\nBut the user must have at least one such child. \n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n    ];\n];\n\nBut how to combine with the previous constraints. Since the conditions are cumulative, the user must have a child who meets all criteria (accident, age, caregiver). \n\nAlternatively, the existing constraint for the child with accident and caregiver must also have the age condition. \n\nSo integrating the age into the existing path:\n\nThe child must have the accident, the CareNeed's caregiver is user, and the child's age <12.\n\nThus, the first sh:property on hasChild would need to include all three:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n        ]\n    ];\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge;\n        sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n    ]\n];\n\nCondition 3: The user had a claim to wages or another benefit before starting care. \n\nThis requires that before the care started, the user had an employment or benefit. \n\nThe accident caused the need for care, so perhaps the accident's date (ff:hasDate) is before the user stopped working. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have had an employment (ff:hasEmployment) or received a benefit like unemployment benefit before the accident. \n\nLooking for properties that indicate previous employment or benefits. \n\nThe ff:receivedBenefit property links to a SocialBenefit they received in the past. \n\nAlternatively, the user had an ff:Employment before the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the user's ff:inEmployment was true before the accident. \n\nThe ontology has ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause which points to Disability, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have had an ff:EarningCapacity before the accident. \n\nThe ff:EarningCapacity has a ff:triggeringEvent which is the accident. \n\nWait, if the user had full earning capacity before the accident, then the accident caused a reduction. \n\nThe ff:triggeringEvent for the user's EarningCapacity could be the accident. \n\nAssuming that the user's EarningCapacity (which is a property of the user via ff:hasEarningCapacity) has a triggeringEvent that is the accident, and the EarningCapacity was previously full. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have had an earning capacity that is now reduced due to the accident. \n\nAlternatively, the accident caused a loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true on the accident event). \n\nThe accident (School or KindergartenAccident) must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings set to true. \n\nSo, the accident's ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true. \n\nSo, adding that to the accident's constraint:\n\nIn the accident's part (ff:hasEvent ?accident), we need:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but causesLossOfEarnings is a data property on Event, right? Yes, looking back:\n\nDataProperty: ff:causesLossOfEarnings\n    Domain: ff:Event\n    Range: xsd:boolean \n\nYes. So, the event (accident) must have this set to true. \n\nThus, condition 3 can be modeled as requiring that the accident has ff:causesLossOfEarnings true. \n\nSo, integrating that into the existing path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n        sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n            sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n        ]\n    ];\n    ... other parts ...\n]\n\nThat would handle condition 3.\n\nCondition 4: No other household member can care for the child. \n\nThe user must be the only caregiver in the household. \n\nThe CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold must be only the user. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed cannot have any other caregiverInHousehold besides the user. \n\nThis is tricky in SHACL. \n\nThe CareNeed must have exactly one caregiverInHousehold, which is the user. \n\nSo, the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold has exactly one value, and that is the user. \n\nIn SHACL:\n\nFor the CareNeed (from the child's needsCare), the caregiverInHousehold must have exactly one value (sh:minCount 1 and sh:maxCount 1), and that value is the user. \n\nThus:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:minCount 1;\n            sh:maxCount 1;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\nBut combining with existing constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the caregiverInHousehold of the CareNeed must be exactly the user. \n\nThis could be done via:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n            sh:maxCount 1;\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\nBut the hasValue requires that all values are the user, but also that there are no others. \n\nAlternatively, the CareNeed must have exactly one caregiverInHousehold which is the user. \n\nBut how to express that in SHACL without SPARQL? \n\nMaybe using sh:qualifiedMinCount and sh:qualifiedMaxCount with sh:hasValue. \n\nLike:\n\nsh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\nsh:qualifiedMaxCount 1;\nsh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User; \n    ]\n]\n\nWait, no, the caregiverInHousehold is an object property pointing to a person. \n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:maxCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n]\n\nBut sh:hasValue would require that all values are ff:User, and since it's exactly one, that works. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo for the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, the path must have exactly one value, which is the user. \n\nThus, the existing constraint for caregiverInHousehold already includes sh:hasValue and with maxCount 1, but in the earlier steps I didn't set maxCount. \n\nSo, in the CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold, we need:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:maxCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n]\n\nHence, integrating that into the existing constraint:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n            sh:minCount 1;\n            sh:maxCount 1;\n            sh:hasValue ff:User;\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\nNow, putting all the conditions together:\n\nThe shape for ff:User must have:\n\n- The user has at least one child who has:\n   - An accident (School or Kindergarten) with causesLossOfEarnings true.\n   - The child's age is <12.\n   - The child's CareNeed's caregiverInHousehold is exactly the user.\n\nAdditionally, the CareNeed must be present (needsCare).\n\nNow, structuring this into SHACL:\n\nThe main shape will be:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ShapeKinderverletztengeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1, 2, 3, 4 all in one property constraint on hasChild\n        sh:path ff:hasChild;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:message \"You must have at least one child meeting the requirements.\"@en;\n        sh:property [\n            # The child must have an accident (School or Kindergarten) with causesLossOfEarnings true\n            sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n            ];\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n            # The child's CareNeed's caregiver must be exactly the user\n            sh:path ff:needsCare;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n                sh:minCount 1;\n                sh:maxCount 1;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User;\n            ];\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n            # The child's age must be <12\n            sh:path ff:hasAge;\n            sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n        ];\n    ];\n    # Any other conditions?\n    # All conditions are covered in the hasChild constraints\n    .\n\nWait, but this structure may not be correct because the path is getting too nested. \n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nThe shape has a property for ff:hasChild, requiring that each child has certain properties. \n\nEach child (object of hasChild) must satisfy:\n\n- hasEvent of the correct type with causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\n- needsCare with caregiverInHousehold exactly the user.\n\n- hasAge <12.\n\nSo, the sh:property on hasChild must have a sh:node that enforces these constraints on the child node. \n\nAlternatively, the sh:property on hasChild must have a sh:nodeShape that applies to the child's node, requiring those constraints. \n\nBut SHACL allows using sh:node to reference a shape. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a nested shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasChild;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:message \"You must have at least one child meeting the requirements.\"@en;\n    sh:node [\n        a sh:NodeShape;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n                sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n            ];\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:needsCare;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n                sh:minCount 1;\n                sh:maxCount 1;\n                sh:hasValue ff:User;\n            ];\n        ];\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasAge;\n            sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n        ];\n    ];\n]\n\nThis way, each child must meet all three conditions. \n\nThis seems better. \n\nSo the final shape would look like this:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ShapeKinderverletztengeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:message \"You must have at least one child meeting all eligibility requirements.\"@en;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape;\n            sh:property [\n                # Accident must be School or Kindergarten Accident with causesLossOfEarnings\n                sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ];\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings;\n                    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean;\n                ];\n            ];\n            sh:property [\n                # CareNeed's caregiver must be exactly the user\n                sh:path ff:needsCare;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold;\n                    sh:minCount 1;\n                    sh:maxCount 1;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:User;\n                ];\n            ];\n            sh:property [\n                # Child's age <12\n                sh:path ff:hasAge;\n                sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int;\n            ];\n        ];\n    ];\n.\n\nThis should cover all four conditions. Let me check each condition again:\n\nCondition 1: The user must be the only caregiver for the child's care need caused by the accident. \n\nYes, the CareNeed's caregiver is exactly the user (min and max 1, hasValue user).\n\nThe accident must be a school or kindergarten accident with causesLossOfEarnings true. \n\nCondition 2: Age <12, yes.\n\nCondition 3: The accident caused loss of earnings (ff:causesLossOfEarnings is true).\n\nCondition 4: No other caregiver (caregiver is only user).\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nNow, check for any other constraints from the text. \n\nWait, the fourth condition says \"no other in the household can care for the child\". The current constraint ensures that the CareNeed's caregiver is exactly the user, which implies that no one else is listed as a caregiver. \n\nBut does the ontology allow multiple caregivers? The ff:caregiverInHousehold is an object property, so a CareNeed can have multiple caregivers. Hence, requiring that the caregiver is only the user covers the condition. \n\nTherefore, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:ShapeKinderverletztengeld\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"You must have at least one child meeting all eligibility requirements.\"@en ;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n                sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:SchoolAccident ff:KindergartenAccident ) ] ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n                    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n                ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:caregiverInHousehold ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:maxCount 1 ;\n                    sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n                ] ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n                sh:maxInclusive \"11\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n.\n```"

Der\nLeistungsanspruch gilt für Kinder und junge Menschen bis zur Vollendung des\n25. Lebensjahres. Leistungen zur Teilhabe am sozialen und kulturellen Leben in\nder Gemeinschaft werden bis zur Vollendung des 18. Lebensjahres bezuschusst.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Bildung und Teilhabe' benefit with ID L100040_LB_12280162 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the benefit is for young people up to 25 years old, or their families receiving certain benefits. The listed benefits include Bürgergeld, Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen, or if the family has low income.\n\nThe SHACL needs to target the ff:User node. I should use SHACL Core components only. Also, I can't model ambiguous parts. Let me check the ontology for the relevant properties and classes.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the SocialBenefit individuals include:\n- ff:B100019_LB_106311931 is Bürgergeld (Citizen benefit)\n- ff:L100040_LB_8665924 is Wohngeld (Housing benefit)\n- ff:B100019_LB_581863 is Kinderzuschlag (Child supplement)\n- ff:SocialAssistance is Sozialhilfe\n- ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits is Asylbewerberleistungen.\n\nThe user must be receiving one of these, or have low income. Also, the age limit is under 25 (hasAge < 25). For Teilhabe until 18, but since the main condition is up to 25, maybe age is checked with hasAge < 25.\n\nFor the income part, if they don't get the listed benefits, they must not be able to cover costs. But how to model \"cannot cover\" using the ontology? There's ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds or family's income? Maybe ff:familyGrossIncome? Wait, the ontology has ff:familyGrossIncome as a DataProperty of ff:Income. So perhaps the user's income (if they have it) must be below a certain threshold, but the exact threshold isn't given. Since the text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\", maybe check if familyGrossIncome is below a certain value, but since the exact figure isn't provided, maybe just existence of low income is sufficient? The problem says not to model ambiguous requirements, so maybe omit the income part unless there's a clear predicate.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a low income, but since the ontology has ff:hasIncome linked to ff:Income which has familyGrossIncome and personalGrossIncome, maybe check that familyGrossIncome is below a threshold. But without specific numbers, perhaps the condition is that they are not receiving the listed benefits and have insufficient income, but how to represent that?\n\nWait the condition says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann...\" So if they don't have any of the listed benefits, then they need to have an income that can't cover the costs. But how to model \"can't cover the costs\" using the ontology? There's ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit which might be relevant. If that's false, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the user's family can't cover their needs, so ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the absence of the listed benefits and having low income (but since the ontology doesn't have a direct \"low income\" predicate, perhaps using ff:hasIncome's properties). Since the user must be eligible either because they receive one of the benefits or because they can't cover costs (and have low income), but the exact way to model the income part is unclear. Since the problem says not to model ambiguous requirements, maybe focus only on the part that can be clearly assessed.\n\nSo the main conditions are:\n\n1. The user is under 25 (hasAge < 25).\n2. OR the user is a minor (under 18) for Teilhabe part, but since the main condition is up to 25, perhaps the age condition is just hasAge < 25.\n\nWait the text says \"Leistungen zur Teilhabe ... bis 18\" but the main benefit is up to 25. Maybe the age condition is simply hasAge < 25.\n\nThe user must be receiving one of the listed benefits OR if not, then they must have an inability to cover costs (but how to model that?).\n\nAlternatively, the user must be receiving at least one of the listed benefits. The part about not receiving them but still eligible due to inability to cover costs might be too ambiguous because it requires assessing financial capacity which may not be directly represented in the ontology. The problem says not to model ambiguous requirements, so perhaps only the part about receiving the listed benefits is modeled.\n\nWait the text says \"Wer keine der genannten Leistungen erhält, die Kosten für Bildung und Teilhabe aber nicht selbst decken kann, hat die Möglichkeit...\" So there's an alternative condition, but how to model \"can't cover costs\". The ontology has ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds or ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit. Maybe if canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit is false, but that's a property of the person. Alternatively, maybe the user's family's income is low (ff:familyGrossIncome is below a certain amount, but without a number, perhaps we can't specify, so maybe omit this part as ambiguous? The user might need to have either the benefits or low income, but without exact data, maybe the SHACL only checks for the benefits part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have at least one of the listed benefits. The alternative condition is optional and can be considered ambiguous, so we can ignore it.\n\nSo first, the main conditions are:\n\n- User has age less than 25.\n\nAND\n\n- User is receiving at least one of the listed benefits (Bürgergeld, Wohngeld + Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen, or Familien mit geringem Einkommen).\n\nWait, but the fifth condition is \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" which is a bit different. Maybe that's covered by income properties. However, since the exact threshold isn't given, perhaps it's better to model only the benefits part.\n\nWait the listed benefits include \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" as a separate condition? Or is that part of the existing benefits? The text says \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\" as an additional option. Since that's not a specific benefit, but rather a condition based on income, which might be too ambiguous (since no threshold is given), perhaps that's excluded as per the problem's instruction. So we can only include the benefits listed before that.\n\nSo the required benefits are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (ff:B100019_LB_106311931)\n\n- Wohngeld (ff:L100040_LB_8665924) AND Kinderzuschlag (ff:B100019_LB_581863). Wait the text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag (§ 6b BKGG)\" so perhaps the user must be receiving both? Or either? The wording in German says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" which could mean both are required. Alternatively, maybe either is sufficient. The problem says to model only what's unambiguous, so perhaps require both? Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to have either of those benefits, but the German wording might be tricky. Since it's ambiguous, maybe just include each as a separate condition. Alternatively, the user must have at least one of them, but I think the original text says \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" as a combined condition, so maybe they must have both. However, without clarity, perhaps treat them as separate and require either, but this is ambiguous. To be safe, perhaps model that the user is receiving Wohngeld OR Kinderzuschlag. But the problem says not to model ambiguous, so maybe just include each as a possible condition.\n\nWait the benefit list includes \"Wohngeld und Kinderzuschlag\" as one item, so maybe the user must have both. But since that's unclear, perhaps it's better to treat them as separate and require either, but the problem says to avoid ambiguous. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have received either of these benefits. Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to have either one. Since it's unclear, perhaps we can model the user having at least one of them, but since the problem says not to model ambiguous, maybe just include each as a possible condition. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have at least one of the listed benefits (including Wohngeld and/or Kinderzuschlag). Maybe the safest way is to include each benefit as a separate condition. So the user must have at least one of the listed benefits.\n\nSo the benefits to check are:\n\n- Bürgergeld (B100019_LB_106311931)\n\n- Wohngeld (L100040_LB_8665924)\n\n- Kinderzuschlag (B100019_LB_581863)\n\n- Sozialhilfe (SocialAssistance)\n\n- Asylbewerberleistungen (AsylumSeekerBenefits)\n\nWait the text says \"Sozialhilfe (SGB XII – Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt, Grundsicherung)\" which is exactly SocialAssistance. And Asylbewerberleistungen are AsylumSeekerBenefits.\n\nAdditionally, the fifth condition is \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\". Since that's not a specific benefit, perhaps it's about the user's income being low. But how to model that? There's ff:familyGrossIncome, but without a threshold, maybe it's better to ignore this part as ambiguous.\n\nSo the main conditions are:\n\n1. User's age < 25.\n\nAND\n\n2. User receives at least one of the following benefits: Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Kinderzuschlag, Sozialhilfe, or Asylbewerberleistungen.\n\nAdditionally, the Teilhabe part is for under 18, but since the main benefit is up to 25, perhaps that's covered by the age condition.\n\nNow, translating this into SHACL.\n\nFirst, create a shape for the User node (ff:User).\n\nThe shape will have:\n\n- A triple for the age condition: ff:hasAge < 25.\n\n- The user must have at least one of the listed benefits. The user is connected via ff:receivesBenefit to one of these benefits.\n\nThe SHACL constraints:\n\n- The User must have a hasAge value less than 25.\n\n- The User must have at least one of the listed benefits via receivesBenefit.\n\nAdditionally, since the user can have multiple, the 'or' condition is handled by sh:or in SHACL.\n\nWait, but the benefits are separate, so we can use sh:property with sh:hasValue for each benefit and use sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a receivesBenefit that is one of the benefits. So the shape for the User would have a property path ff:receivesBenefit that includes one of the listed individuals.\n\nLet me structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, the target node is ff:User.\n\nThe shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:integer ;  # since under 25 means less than 25, so max is 24\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931,  # Bürgergeld\n                ff:L100040_LB_8665924,    # Wohngeld\n                ff:B100019_LB_581863,     # Kinderzuschlag\n                ff:SocialAssistance,      # Sozialhilfe\n                ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ; # Asylbewerberleistungen\n    sh:or [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n      ]\n    ] ;\n    # Wait, no, maybe better to require that at least one of the listed benefits is present via receivesBenefit.\n\n    # Alternatively, the sh:hasValue is not the right approach because the user must have a receivesBenefit that is one of those benefits. \n\n    # The correct way is to use sh:hasValue in the path, but perhaps sh:hasValue in the property.\n\n    # Wait, the ff:receivesBenefit property links to a SocialBenefit. The user must have at least one of those specific SocialBenefit individuals.\n\n    # So, the constraint is that the user's receivesBenefit must have at least one of these values.\n\n    # To model this, use sh:hasValue for each of the benefits, and sh:or.\n\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ] ]\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ] ]\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ] ]\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ] ]\n      [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ; sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ] ]\n    )\n  ] .\n\nWait, but that's a lot of or conditions. Alternatively, using sh:in with a list of the individuals.\n\nWait the sh:hasValue is for checking if the value is exactly that. So, to require that at least one of the listed benefits is present, the user must have at least one receivesBenefit link to any of those.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:or [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path rdf:type ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931,\n                  ff:L100040_LB_8665924,\n                  ff:B100019_LB_581863,\n                  ff:SocialAssistance,\n                  ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits\n    ]\n  ]\n];\n\nBut that might not be correct because the rdf:type of the receivedBenefit must be one of those. Alternatively, the receivedBenefit must be exactly one of those individuals.\n\nWait, the benefits are individuals (like ff:B100019_LB_106311931 is the Bürgergeld instance), so the user's receivesBenefit must have at least one of those specific individuals.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nFor the receivesBenefit property, the value must be one of those specific individuals. So using sh:hasValue in each condition.\n\nSo the SHACL constraint would have a sh:or with multiple conditions, each checking if the receivesBenefit has one of the values.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:in, but I think sh:in can be used for the property's value to be in a list. Wait, in SHACL Core, sh:in allows specifying a list of possible values. So perhaps:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:in (ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n          ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n          ff:B100019_LB_581863\n          ff:SocialAssistance\n          ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits )\n] .\n\nWait that's better. So the user must have at least one ff:receivesBenefit that is one of those individuals. So the property's values must be in the list. Since the user needs to have at least one, the minCount 1 ensures that there's at least one such entry.\n\nSo the shape would be:\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:integer ; # 24 is under 25\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in (ff:B100019_LB_106311931\n            ff:L100040_LB_8665924\n            ff:B100019_LB_581863\n            ff:SocialAssistance\n            ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits )\n  ] .\n\nWait, but the fifth condition was \"Familien mit geringem Einkommen\". Since that's not a benefit but an income condition, and without exact criteria, perhaps it's omitted as per the problem's instruction to exclude ambiguous parts. So the above covers the listed benefits except the income part.\n\nAdditionally, the age is checked with maxInclusive 24.\n\nI think this should work. Let me check again:\n\n- The target is ff:User.\n\n- The age must be <=24 (since under 25).\n\n- The user must have at least one receivesBenefit pointing to one of the listed benefits.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the SHACL syntax must be correct in Turtle.\n\nAlso, the namespace prefixes need to be included. The ontology uses ff: and others, but in the SHACL, we need to define the prefixes.\n\nWait the problem says to serialize in Turtle and use the ontology's prefixes. The ontology already has the prefixes like ff: and others. So in the SHACL, we can use those prefixes.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:integer ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in (\n      ff:B100019_LB_106311931  # Bürgergeld\n      ff:L100040_LB_8665924    # Wohngeld\n      ff:B100019_LB_581863     # Kinderzuschlag\n      ff:SocialAssistance      # Sozialhilfe\n      ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits  # Asylbewerberleistungen\n    ) ;\n  ] .\n```\n\nWait, but the Wohngeld is L100040_LB_8665924, which is correct. Also, the Kinderzuschlag is B100019_LB_581863. The Sozialhilfe is ff:SocialAssistance. Asylbewerberleistungen is ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The fifth condition (Familien mit geringem Einkommen) is omitted because it's ambiguous.\n\nThis should fulfill the requirements as per the given text and ontology.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:maxInclusive \"24\"^^xsd:integer ;  # Under 25 years old\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in (\n      ff:B100019_LB_106311931  # Bürgergeld (Citizen benefit)\n      ff:L100040_LB_8665924    # Wohngeld (Housing benefit)\n      ff:B100019_LB_581863     # Kinderzuschlag (Child supplement)\n      ff:SocialAssistance      # Sozialhilfe (Social assistance)\n      ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits  # Asylbewerberleistungen (Asylum seeker benefits)\n    ) ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the given social benefit eligibility requirements. The benefit is 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' with the ID B100019_LB_102716305. The user data must be validated against these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's parse the requirements step by step.\n\nThe main conditions are:\n\n1. The user must have a disability and need special support for workforce integration. The Federal Employment Agency must be their rehabilitation provider.\n2. They must participate in one of the specified measures (like vocational training, vocational preparation, etc.).\n3. For the last 3 years (Vorbereitungszeit), one of these must apply:\n   - At least 12 months of social security coverage.\n   - Eligible for unemployment benefit (SGB III) and have applied.\n   - Entitled to unemployment assistance under SVG.\n   \nExceptions:\n- If a vocational returnee with disabilities, the 3-year period doesn't apply.\n- If within the last year before starting the measure, they obtained a recognized vocational qualification or equivalent, the 3-year condition is waived.\n\nNow, mapping to the ontology.\n\nStarting with the first condition:\n- Disability: Use ff:hasDisability (data property) set to true. Or, maybe the object property ff:hasDisabilityType, but the data property seems more direct here.\n- Need special support: The requirement mentions needing support for workforce integration because of disability. The ontology has 'workforceIntegrationProblemBecause' which points to Disability. So the user must have a Disability linked via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause.\n- Rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency. The object property ff:hasRehabilitationProvider should link to ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nSecond condition: Participation in specific measures. The user must be participating in a Training instance that is one of the allowed types. The allowed measures include vocational training, vocational preparation, etc. Looking at the ontology, the classes under Training: EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea, VocationalTraining, School (which is a Training), etc. The exact classes might need checking. The participation is via ff:participates to a Training instance. But the SHACL would need to check that the training is of a certain type. So, the training must be a subclass of Training, but more specific. Since the text lists several options like \"Berufsausbildung\" (VocationalTraining), \"Eingangsverfahren\" (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea), etc., the shapes should require that the training is an instance of these subclasses.\n\nThird condition's Vorbeschäftungszeit (pre-employment period) requirements. The last 3 years:\n\na) At least 12 months social security. The ontology has ff:socialSecurityDuration, which is a Duration. The monthsTotal property on Duration should be >=12. But how is this linked? The user has a socialSecurityDuration, which is a Duration with monthsTotal >=12.\n\nb) Eligible for unemployment benefit (B100019_LB_576842) and have applied. So the user must have ff:isEligibleFor that benefit and maybe a flag indicating they applied? The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, but maybe not. Alternatively, the user has an EmploymentStatus of RegisteredUnemployed or something, but the exact data property for having applied might not exist. Wait, the ontology has ff:receivedBenefit and ff:receivesBenefit, but maybe the key is that they are eligible for Arbeitslosengeld (ff:B100019_LB_576842) and have applied. Since SHACL can't track actions like applying, perhaps the requirement is just that they are eligible for it. The ontology's ff:isEligibleFor would link to the benefit. So the user must have ff:isEligibleFor that benefit.\n\nc) Entitled to SVG unemployment assistance (ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG). So ff:isEligibleFor that benefit.\n\nFor exceptions:\n\n- Vocational returnee (ff:isVocationalReturnee is true). If so, the 3-year period condition is waived. So, we need to exclude the 3-year checks if this is true.\n\n- Obtained a recognized qualification in the last year before the measure. The measure's start date is important. The user has an Education (Training) instance with intendedFundingPeriod's start date within the last year? Or maybe the user has an Employment or Training that started within the last year. But the ontology's ff:hasDate on Event might be needed. Alternatively, the user's previous training's end date must be within the last year. The ontology has ff:participates pointing to a Training, which has ff:intendedFundingPeriod. The start date would be part of the Duration? Or perhaps the Training has an ff:hasDate (if Event?), but Training isn't an Event. Hmm. Maybe the Training's duration's end date is within the last year before the current measure starts. This might be tricky. Alternatively, the ontology has ff:hasDate on Event, but the training isn't an Event. Maybe the user has a Training instance where the duration's end date is within the last year. Since SHACL can't directly handle temporal reasoning without SPARQL, perhaps we need a flag like a data property indicating this, but the ontology might not have that. Since the user can't model it, maybe it's better to note that this requirement can't be assessed and thus not included, per the rules. Wait, the user must not model ambiguous requirements. The text says \"if within the last year before Maßnahmebeginn (measure start) they obtained...\" So the measure's start date is needed. Since SHACL can't perform date calculations, this might be ambiguous and thus excluded. The user instructions say not to model requirements that can't be clearly assessed. So this exception might need to be omitted.\n\nWait, the user must strictly comply with not modeling ambiguous requirements. So the exception about having a qualification in the last year might not be representable because it depends on dates which would require date arithmetic. Since SHACL Core can't do that, perhaps this exception is excluded. The same applies to the 'last year' part.\n\nSo, focusing on what can be modeled.\n\nNow, building the SHACL shapes.\n\nThe target is ff:User, so the shape must be a Shape with a targetClass of ff:User or targetNode ff:User.\n\nFirst shape for main conditions:\n\nShape 1: User must have a disability, need workforce integration support via Disability, and FederalEmploymentAgency as rehab provider.\n\nShape:\n\n:MainShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] ;\n    ...\n\nSecond condition: participating in allowed training.\n\nAnother property:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class [\n        sh:or (\n            [sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining] \n            [sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea] \n            [sh:instanceOf ff:School] ; // if School is one of the options\n            // etc. Need to check all allowed types.\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, the allowed measures are:\n\n- Berufsausbildung (VocationalTraining)\n- Berufsvorbereitung (maybe part of VocationalTraining?)\n- individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der \"Unterstützten Beschäftigung\" (maybe under OccupationalRehabilitation? Not sure, but maybe part of VocationalTraining or another subclass)\n- Maßnahme im Eingangsverfahren oder Berufsbildungsbereich einer Werkstatt für behinderte Menschen (EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea)\n- berufliche Weiterbildung (VocationalTraining or another subclass like Training?)\n\nLooking at the ontology:\n\n- EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of Training.\n\n- VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training.\n\n- School is a subclass of Training.\n\nAssuming that all the listed measures are under Training subclasses, so the shape can require that the participates points to a Training instance of one of those subclasses. The SHACL 'sh:class' with 'sh:or' can list the allowed classes.\n\nSo, the participates must point to a Training instance of VocationalTraining, EntryProcedure..., School, etc.\n\nBut maybe the exact classes are needed. The text lists:\n\n\"Berufsausbildung\" → VocationalTraining\n\n\"Berufsvorbereitung\" → perhaps VocationalTraining or another subclass?\n\n\"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung\" → maybe part of OccupationalRehabilitation? Not sure. The ontology has OccupationalRehabilitation as a class. Maybe this is part of that, but since the user must participate in a Training, perhaps it's under another subclass. Alternatively, maybe the OccupationalRehabilitation is part of the measure, but the Training is the correct path.\n\nThe user needs to participate in one of the specified measures. Assuming all are under Training subclasses, so the participates must be to a Training that is one of the listed types. So the SHACL will check the instanceOf for the Training.\n\nThird condition: the Vorbeschäftungszeit (3-year pre-employment period) requirements.\n\nThe user must satisfy at least one of the three options.\n\nSo, this is an OR condition between the three options. SHACL allows this with sh:or.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [] ; // need to structure this as a group\n    sh:or (\n        [sh:property [ sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ; sh:minCount 1 ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:monthsTotal ; sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int ] ; ] ] \n        [sh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; sh:minCount 1 ; sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ; ] ] \n        [sh:property [ sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ; sh:minCount 1 ; sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ; ] ]\n    )\n]\n\nWait, but how to structure the OR between the three options. The shape needs a property that requires at least one of these three to be true.\n\nAlternatively, use a group with sh:or.\n\nSo, in the main shape, under sh:property, have a group with sh:or containing three conditions.\n\nBut the syntax would be something like:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [] ;  // no path, just a group\n    sh:or (\n        [ ... condition a ... ]\n        [ ... condition b ... ]\n        [ ... condition c ... ]\n    )\n]\n\nWait, but in SHACL, the sh:or is applied to the sh:property's constraints. So perhaps the group is needed.\n\nAlternatively, for each condition, but with sh:or on the properties.\n\nAlternatively, create three separate shapes and use sh:or on the shapes, but target must be User.\n\nAlternatively, use a group with sh:or between three shapes.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each condition as a property path.\n\nFirst condition a: The user has a socialSecurityDuration with monthsTotal >=12.\n\nSo:\n\ncondition a: has a socialSecurityDuration linked, which has monthsTotal >=12.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ \n        sh:inversePath ff:socialSecurityDuration ;  // Wait, ff:socialSecurityDuration is a property from Person to Duration, so the path is ff:socialSecurityDuration. So to check the Duration's monthsTotal:\n\n        sh:property [ sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ; sh/minCount 1 ; sh:property [ sh:path ff:monthsTotal ; sh:minInclusive 12 ] ] \n    ];\n    sh:minCount 1\n]\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nFor the user to have a socialSecurityDuration that has monthsTotal ≥12:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:monthsTotal ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int\n    ]\n]\n\nCondition b: isEligibleFor ff:B100019_LB_576842 (Arbeitslosengeld) and have applied. But the ontology doesn't have an 'applied' flag. The requirement says \"anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld nach dem SGB III und dieses aktuell beantragt.\" (eligible and have applied). Since there's no property for having applied, perhaps we can only check eligibility. So the user must be eligible for that benefit:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n]\n\nCondition c: is eligible for SVG unemployment benefit:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n]\n\nSo the OR is between these three conditions. So the group must have sh:or between these three properties.\n\nThus, in the main shape:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:group [\n        sh:or (\n            [  # Condition a\n                sh:property [\n                    sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n                    sh:minCount 1 ;\n                    sh:property [\n                        sh:path ff:monthsTotal ;\n                        sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int\n                    ]\n                ]\n            ]\n            [  # Condition b\n                sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n            ]\n            [  # Condition c\n                sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but the group's structure might be more complex. Alternatively, use sh:or on the property definitions.\n\nAlternatively, structure the group as a set of constraints where any of the three must be true. Using sh:or on the constraints.\n\nNow, exceptions:\n\nThe exceptions allow certain conditions to be waived. The first exception says if the user is a vocational returnee (ff:isVocationalReturnee is true), then the 3-year period condition (the social security, unemployment eligibility, etc.) is not required.\n\nSo, the 3-year condition is only required if the user is NOT a vocational returnee.\n\nThis is a conditional: if isVocationalReturnee is false, then the 3-year conditions must be met.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be handled with a sh:disjoint or by using sh:property with a constraint that depends on the value of another property.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:or to allow either the exception or the original condition.\n\nWait, the exception allows the 3-year conditions to be skipped. So the overall condition is:\n\nEither:\n\n- The user is a vocational returnee (so the 3-year conditions are not needed), OR\n\n- The user is not a vocational returnee AND the 3-year conditions are met.\n\nSo in SHACL terms:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n        [ \n            sh:group [\n                sh:and (\n                    [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n                    [ ... the 3-year conditions ... ]\n                )\n            ]\n        ]\n    )\n]\n\nWait, but this might not be the right structure. Alternatively, the overall shape must satisfy either:\n\nEither:\n\n- isVocationalReturnee is true (so the rest is okay), OR\n\n- The 3-year conditions are met.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:or (\n        [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n        [ ... the 3-year conditions group ... ]\n    )\n]\n\nThus, the main shape's property for the 3-year conditions would be wrapped in an OR with the returnee condition.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main shape would have all the conditions except the 3-year one, then the 3-year condition with the exception handling.\n\nAlternatively, integrate the exception into the existing OR structure.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try to outline the shape step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape for the user:\n\n:MainShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # since the user must target the node User\n    # Condition 1: Disability and need support, rehab provider\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] ;\n    # Condition 2: participate in allowed training\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or (\n                [sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining]\n                [sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea]\n                [sh:instanceOf ff:School]\n                # Add other subclasses if needed. Wait, the allowed measures include \"berufliche Weiterbildung\", which might be part of Training but not explicitly listed. The ontology's Training subclasses include VocationalTraining, Entry..., School. Maybe that's sufficient.\n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    # Condition 3 with exceptions:\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            # Case 1: vocational returnee\n            [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n            # Case 2: not returnee and meets 3-year conditions\n            [ \n                sh:group [\n                    sh:and (\n                        [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ] \n                        [ \n                            sh:group [\n                                sh:or (\n                                    [ ... condition a ... ]\n                                    [ ... condition b ... ]\n                                    [ ... condition c ... ]\n                                )\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n]\n\nWait, but the structure might be incorrect. Alternatively, the 3rd condition (Vorbeschäftungszeit) is handled by the OR between the returnee and the 3-year conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the entire 3-year condition block is:\n\nEither:\n\n- isVocationalReturnee is true, so no need for 3-year checks,\n\nOR\n\n- (isVocationalReturnee is false) AND (one of a/b/c is true).\n\nThus:\n\nThe sh:or for the 3rd condition:\n\nsh:or ( \n\n    [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n\n    [ \n\n        sh:group [\n            sh:and ( \n                [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n                [ \n                    sh:group [\n                        sh:or ( ... the three conditions ... )\n                    ]\n                ]\n            )\n        ]\n\n    ]\n\n)\n\nThis way, the user can either be a returnee (so condition met) or not a returnee but meets the 3-year conditions.\n\nNow, the other exception about the qualification in the last year is excluded because it can't be assessed without date handling.\n\nPutting all together in Turtle:\n\nThe shape must target ff:User as the node, using sh:targetNode.\n\nNow, assembling all the parts.\n\nAlso, ensure that all properties use the correct ontology terms.\n\nCheck for any other requirements:\n\nThe user must not have conflicting benefits? The text doesn't say that.\n\nAlso, the user must not have priority claims over this benefit? The ontology has hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, but the text doesn't mention it.\n\nNow, coding this into SHACL:\n\nThe final shape will be complex, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the main shape:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n:MainShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # Target the User node\n    sh:property [\n        # Condition 1a: hasDisability is true\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] , [\n        # Condition 1b: workforceIntegrationProblemBecause points to a Disability\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability ;\n    ] , [\n        # Condition 1c: has FederalEmploymentAgency as rehab provider\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] , [\n        # Condition 2: participates in one of the allowed trainings\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ]\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ]\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:School ]  # Assuming School covers part of the allowed measures\n            )\n        ]\n    ] , [\n        # Condition 3 with exceptions:\n        sh:or (\n            # Case 1: vocational returnee\n            [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] \n            # Case 2: not returnee and meets 3-year conditions\n            [\n                sh:group [\n                    sh:and (\n                        # Not a returnee\n                        [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n                        # Meet one of a/b/c\n                        [\n                            sh:group [\n                                sh:or (\n                                    # a) 12 months social security\n                                    [\n                                        sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n                                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:property [\n                                            sh:path ff:monthsTotal ;\n                                            sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int\n                                        ]\n                                    ]\n                                    # b) eligible for unemployment benefit\n                                    [\n                                        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n                                    ]\n                                    # c) entitled to SVG unemployment\n                                    [\n                                        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n                                    ]\n                                )\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n.\n\nWait, but in SHACL, each sh:property in the shape's sh:property list is separate. The last part (Condition 3) is a property with sh:or. But in the current structure, the last entry in sh:property is the condition 3's or. However, the way it's written might be incorrect. Let me re-express.\n\nActually, the condition 3's entire structure is part of the shape's properties. The SHACL syntax requires that each property is a separate triple in the list. So the last property is the one handling condition3 with exceptions.\n\nYes, the above code should work, but let me check the syntax.\n\nAnother thing: The user must have exactly one of the 3-year conditions OR be a returnee. So the sh:or between those two.\n\nAlso, for the social security duration, the path is ff:socialSecurityDuration, which is a property of the user to a Duration instance. The Duration's monthsTotal must be ≥12.\n\nThe other conditions are about isEligibleFor the benefits.\n\nNow, check if the ontology has the SocialBenefit instances correctly:\n\n- Arbeitslosengeld is ff:B100019_LB_576842.\n\n- SVG unemployment is ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: The 'participates' must be to a Training instance. The current code uses sh:class with sh:or on the instanceOf. That's correct.\n\nNow, this should cover all the required conditions except the second exception (the qualification in the last year). Since we can't model that due to date constraints, we omit it.\n\nThus, the final SHACL shape should be as above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:MainShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;  # Target the user node\n\n    # Condition 1: Disability and workforce integration support\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n    ] ;\n    \n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Disability\n    ] ;\n    \n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency\n    ] ;\n\n    # Condition 2: Participation in allowed training\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or (\n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:VocationalTraining ] \n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ] \n                [ sh:instanceOf ff:School ]\n            )\n        ]\n    ] ;\n\n    # Condition 3: Vorbeschäftungszeit requirements with exceptions\n    sh:property [\n        sh:or (\n            # Case 1: Vocational returnee exception\n            [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] \n\n            # Case 2: Non-returnee must meet 3-year conditions\n            [\n                sh:group [\n                    sh:and (\n                        # Must not be a vocational returnee\n                        [ sh:path ff:isVocationalReturnee ; sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ] \n                        \n                        # Must satisfy at least one of the 3-year requirements\n                        [\n                            sh:group [\n                                sh:or (\n                                    # a) 12 months social security\n                                    [\n                                        sh:path ff:socialSecurityDuration ;\n                                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:property [\n                                            sh:path ff:monthsTotal ;\n                                            sh:minInclusive \"12\"^^xsd:int\n                                        ]\n                                    ]\n\n                                    # b) Eligible for unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld)\n                                    [\n                                        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842\n                                    ]\n\n                                    # c) Entitled to SVG unemployment benefit\n                                    [\n                                        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n                                        sh:minCount 1 ;\n                                        sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG\n                                    ]\n                                )\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                    )\n                ]\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n.\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' (B100019_LB_582404). The goal is to ensure that the generated SHACL correctly captures the eligibility criteria provided in the text.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the eligibility requirements given. The conditions are:\n\n1. The person must be legally insured under accident insurance.\n2. Their earning capacity is reduced:\n   - due to one or more insurance events,\n   - beyond the 26th week after the insurance event,\n   - by at least 20%.\n\nThe ontology provided includes various classes, properties, and individuals. Let me recall the relevant parts from the ontology. \n\nStarting with the first condition: being legally insured under accident insurance. The ontology has an individual ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance under the Insurance class. The person must have this insurance. The property ff:hasInsurance links a person to their insurance. So, the SHACL shape should require that the user has an insurance that is exactly ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nNext, the earning capacity reduction. The ontology has ff:EarningCapacity as a class. The user's earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20%. Looking at the data properties, there's ff:reductionInPercent which indicates the percentage reduction. The value should be >= 20. \n\nThe reduction must be due to one or more insurance events. The ontology's ff:EarningCapacity has a property ff:triggeringEvent which links to an event. The insurance events are subclasses of ff:Event, such as WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc. So, the triggeringEvent must be an instance of an insurance event (which I think are all under ff:Event, but maybe need to check if there's a specific class for insurance cases). Wait, the ontology lists several event subclasses like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc., which are types of insurance cases. Since the triggering event must be an insurance event, the triggeringEvent should be an instance of one of these. However, SHACL can't directly enforce that the event is an insurance case unless there's a specific class. Since the problem statement refers to \"Versicherungsfälle\" (insurance cases), but the ontology might not have a specific class for that. Alternatively, maybe all relevant events are under ff:Event, so perhaps it's sufficient to just require that there is a triggering event. But the problem requires it's due to one or more insurance events. Hmm, perhaps the triggering event must be of a type that is considered an insurance case. Since the ontology's Event subclasses like WorkAccident are part of insurance cases, maybe the triggeringEvent must be an instance of a subclass of ff:Event (excluding others like MoveToGermany, etc.), but I might have to accept that as long as the triggeringEvent exists, assuming that the event is an insurance case. Alternatively, maybe the ontology has a class for insurance events, but I don't see it. Let me check the ontology again.\n\nLooking at the ontology's classes under Event: CommutingAccident, DiscontinuationOfBusiness, KindergartenAccident, MedicalAccompaniment, MoveToGermany, OccupationalDisease, SchoolAccident, WorkAccident. These are all specific types of events. The problem's condition mentions \"Versicherungsfälle\", which are the types covered by accident insurance. For example, WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc., so the triggering event must be one of these. But how to model that in SHACL? Since SHACL doesn't support checking if a node is an instance of a certain class directly unless using sh:class, but in this case, the user's data must have the triggeringEvent linked to an instance of an appropriate Event subclass. However, in SHACL, we can enforce that the value of ff:triggeringEvent is an instance of one of these classes. Wait, but SHACL shapes can have a target for nodes, so perhaps the shape for the earning capacity must have a property path that ensures the triggeringEvent is an instance of an insurance case event. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows us to just ensure that there exists at least one triggeringEvent, and the application will handle the rest? But the problem says \"due to one or more insurance events\", so the trigger must be an insurance event. Since the ontology doesn't have an explicit 'InsuranceCase' class, maybe we need to rely on the application's data correctly using the right event types, but the SHACL can only check that the triggeringEvent exists. This is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the problem expects that the SHACL just requires the existence of a triggeringEvent, and the percentage, without getting into the event's type. The user instructions say to not model requirements that are ambiguous or at third party's discretion. Since the ontology doesn't have a specific class for insurance events, maybe it's acceptable to just check that there is at least one triggeringEvent (i.e., the property is present with some value), and the percentage is at least 20. The problem states \"infolge eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle\", so the triggeringEvent must be such an event. Since SHACL can't enforce the type unless the ontology has a class, perhaps we proceed by requiring that the triggeringEvent is present (but that's not sufficient). Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to look again at the ontology's Event subclasses. Since the insurance events like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc., are all sublcasses of Event, but there's no general class for all insurance events. So perhaps the SHACL can't enforce that, so the problem might consider it as a given, and just require that the triggeringEvent exists, but the user might have to have that event. Since the user can't model it without the ontology's structure, maybe we proceed by requiring that the triggeringEvent exists, and move on. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the triggeringEvent is present, and that the reductionInPercent is >=20.\n\nThe next part is \"über die 26. Woche nach dem Versicherungsfall hinaus\" which translates to beyond the 26th week after the insurance event. This means that the reduction in earning capacity must have lasted for more than 26 weeks. The ontology has a data property ff:reductionDurationInWeeks on EarningCapacity, which indicates the duration in weeks. So, the reductionDurationInWeeks must be greater than or equal to 27 weeks (since it's beyond the 26th week). Wait, the wording says \"über die 26. Woche hinaus\", which is after the 26th week. So the duration must be at least 27 weeks. Therefore, reductionDurationInWeeks >= 27.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape must target ff:User, so we start with a shape that targets the User node.\n\nFirst, the insurance requirement:\n\n- The user must have an insurance (ff:hasInsurance) that is exactly StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So a property shape on ff:hasInsurance requiring that the value is exactly ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nSecond, the earning capacity conditions:\n\nThe user must have an earning capacity (ff:hasEarningCapacity) that:\n\n- has a reductionInPercent >= 20,\n\n- has a reductionDurationInWeeks >=27,\n\n- has at least one triggeringEvent (which is an insurance event, but perhaps just checking that the property exists is enough here, unless we can enforce the event type. Since we can't, proceed by requiring that the triggeringEvent exists).\n\nWait, but the problem states \"infolge eines oder mehrerer Versicherungsfälle\" meaning the triggering event must be an insurance case. But without an explicit class for that, perhaps the SHACL can't enforce this, so maybe the problem expects us to ignore that part and just check that there's a triggeringEvent, since it's part of the ontology's structure. So the triggeringEvent is present (i.e., the property exists with at least one value).\n\nSo for the earning capacity:\n\n- The user must have an EarningCapacity (so the hasEarningCapacity property must exist, but SHACL can enforce that via sh:hasValue or sh:minCount 1).\n\nWait, the earning capacity itself is an instance of EarningCapacity. So the user must have an EarningCapacity via hasEarningCapacity. The shape for the EarningCapacity must have those constraints. Therefore:\n\nThe main shape for the user:\n\n- Must have ff:hasEarningCapacity pointing to an EarningCapacity node that satisfies the following constraints:\n\n   a) reductionInPercent >= 20\n\n   b) reductionDurationInWeeks >= 27\n\n   c) has at least one triggeringEvent (so ff:triggeringEvent must exist with at least one value).\n\nAdditionally, the user must have the accident insurance.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL:\n\nStart with a base shape for the User:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ;\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n\nWait, but in SHACL, when using sh:node, it's a nested NodeShape. So for the hasEarningCapacity, we need to ensure that the value is an EarningCapacity and that it has those properties. The above structure should work.\n\nWait, the user must have at least one EarningCapacity (hasEarningCapacity with minCount 1). Then, each such EarningCapacity must have the required properties.\n\nAdditionally, the triggeringEvent must be an instance of an Event (since it's a property of EarningCapacity, which according to the ontology, ff:triggeringEvent has domain EarningCapacity and range Event. So the triggeringEvent must be an instance of an Event. But since SHACL can't enforce the type unless specified, perhaps it's not needed here because the ontology defines the range as Event, so the data should comply. But in SHACL, perhaps we can enforce that the triggeringEvent is an instance of Event. Wait, but the ontology's Event is a class, so in SHACL we can have:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:Event ;\n]\n\nBut since the triggeringEvent's range is already Event, maybe that's redundant. However, the user might have the property but pointing to a non-Event node, so adding sh:class ff:Event ensures it's an instance of Event.\n\nBut the problem requires that the triggering event is an insurance case (Versicherungsfälle), which are specific Event subclasses. Since there's no way to enforce that in SHACL without knowing which subclasses are allowed, and the ontology doesn't have a general class for insurance cases, we can't model that here. Therefore, the problem's instruction says to not model requirements that are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties. Since the insurance event type is determined by the insurance's coverage, which might be beyond the SHACL's scope here, perhaps we can proceed by just ensuring that the triggeringEvent exists and is an instance of Event (which the ontology already enforces, but the SHACL can reinforce). Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that as long as the triggeringEvent exists, that's sufficient, so just the minCount 1 is enough.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should include those constraints.\n\nWait also, the reductionDurationInWeeks must be at least 27. The problem states \"über die 26. Woche hinaus\", which is beyond the 26th week, so 27 or more. So sh:minInclusive 27.\n\nAlso, the reductionInPercent must be at least 20, so sh:minInclusive 20.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe SHACL would have a NodeShape for ff:User with two properties:\n\n1. hasInsurance must include StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n2. hasEarningCapacity must point to an EarningCapacity node that has:\n\n   - reductionInPercent >=20,\n\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27,\n\n   - at least one triggeringEvent (which is an Event instance).\n\nAdditionally, the user must have an EarningCapacity (so sh:minCount 1 on hasEarningCapacity).\n\nTherefore, the Turtle code would look like this.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Earning capacity reduced by at least 20% beyond 26 weeks\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ;\n        sh:node [\n            a sh:NodeShape ;\n            \n            # At least 20% reduction in earning capacity\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            ] ;\n            \n            # Duration must be ≥27 weeks (beyond 26th week)\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n                sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ;\n            ] ;\n            \n            # Must be caused by an insurance event\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n                sh:minCount 1 ;\n                sh:class ff:Event ;\n            ]\n        ]\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit \"Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung\" (B100019_LB_103817036). The user provided the ontology and the eligibility conditions in German. My goal is to translate those conditions into SHACL constraints targeting the \"ff:User\" node.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the eligibility requirements:\n\n1. Both the user and the accompanied person with disability are statutorily insured (gesetzlich krankenversichert).\n2. The accompanied person is undergoing inpatient treatment in a hospital.\n3. The inpatient accompaniment is medically necessary. Full-day accompaniment (8+ hours including travel) is considered equivalent.\n4. The user has a loss of earnings (Verdienstausfall).\n5. The user is a close relative or part of the immediate circle (engstem Umfeld).\n6. The accompanied person receives Integration Assistance (Eingliederungshilfe). The user can't receive sick pay if they're being paid for assisting (e.g., as a personal assistant). If within Integration Assistance, costs are covered by the Integration Assistance providers.\n\nNow, I need to map these conditions to the ontology provided.\n\nStarting with condition 1: Statutory health insurance. The ontology has ff:adequateHealthInsurance (a data property under Person) which is boolean. Since both the user and the accompanied person must have it, but the user is the target node, maybe we need to check the user's own insurance and also that their accompanied person has it. However, the ontology's ff:hasInsurance links Person to Insurance. The statutory health insurance is an instance (ff:StatutoryHealthInsurance). So perhaps the user must have that insurance, and the accompanied person (linked via some property?) must also have it. But the user's data graph might link to the accompanied person via an object property. Looking at the ontology, maybe ff:caregiverInHousehold? Wait, no, the domain of ff:caregiverInHousehold is CareNeed. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user is linked via ff:closeRelative to the accompanied person. Wait, the user is part of the close relatives or immediate circle (condition 5). The ontology has ff:closeRelative which links a person to another person. So the user has a closeRelative which is the accompanied person. Alternatively, maybe the accompanied person is linked via another property. Alternatively, perhaps the user has an ff:hasCareNeed pointing to a CareNeed where the caregiver is the user? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is linked via the ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent? Not sure. This requires careful mapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accompanied person is the one being treated, so perhaps the user has a relationship to that person via ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember. Let's assume that the user is connected to the accompanied person via ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember. Then, the accompanied person must have ff:hasInsurance as StatutoryHealthInsurance. But how to express that in SHACL? Since the SHACL shape must target ff:User, perhaps the user must have a closeRelative who has that insurance. But SHACL can have constraints that traverse properties.\n\nCondition 2: The accompanied person is in inpatient treatment. The ontology has ff:MedicalAccompaniment as a subclass of Event. Wait, the MedicalAccompaniment is an Event. The property ff:inPatientCoAdmission might be relevant? Or perhaps the accompanied person is undergoing a MedicalAccompaniment that is inpatient. Alternatively, the ontology has ff:MedicalAccompaniment as an Event. Maybe the accompanied person has an ff:hasEvent of type MedicalAccompaniment where ff:inPatientCoAdmission is true? Or perhaps the MedicalAccompaniment itself has properties indicating inpatient status. The ontology's ff:inPatientCoAdmission is a data property of MedicalAccompaniment, so if that is true, that indicates inpatient accompaniment. \n\nCondition 3: The accompaniment is medically necessary. The full-day requirement is covered by ff:fullDayAccompaniment (a data property of MedicalAccompaniment, which is true if it's over 8 hours including travel). So the MedicalAccompaniment event must have fullDayAccompaniment = true.\n\nCondition 4: The user has a Verdienstausfall (loss of earnings). The ontology has ff:causesLossOfEarnings on the Event (triggeringEvent?), but perhaps the user's event (maybe the accompaniment event) has this set to true. Or the user has an EarningCapacity that is reduced. Wait, the data property ff:causesLossOfEarnings is on Event. So maybe the triggering event (the accompaniment?) has causesLossOfEarnings = true. But how to link that.\n\nCondition 5: User is close relative or part of immediate circle. The ontology has ff:closeRelative and ff:immediateCircleMember. So the user must have at least one of these properties pointing to the accompanied person. Or maybe the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember that is the accompanied person. So, in SHACL, the user must have either a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, and that person is the one being accompanied. But how to express that the accompanied person is the same as the one in condition 1 and 2?\n\nCondition 6: The accompanied person receives Integration Assistance (Eingliederungshilfe), which is an instance of SocialBenefit (ff:IntegrationAssistance). The user can't receive the benefit if they are paid for the assistance, but that's perhaps an exclusion. The problem states that the user must not be receiving payment, so maybe the user's income has to not include such a payment. Alternatively, the Integration Assistance provider covers the costs. But how to model this in SHACL. The accompanied person must have a ff:receivesBenefit linked to ff:IntegrationAssistance. \n\nNow, putting this together into SHACL shapes.\n\nFirst, the main shape for ff:User must have all these constraints.\n\n1. The user must have adequate health insurance: ff:adequateHealthInsurance = true. But wait, the ontology's ff:adequateHealthInsurance is a data property of Person, so the user must have that set to true.\n\nWait, looking at the ontology's data properties: ff:adequateHealthInsurance is a boolean under Person. So for the user (ff:User), we need:\n\na constraint that requires ff:adequateHealthInsurance to be true.\n\nAdditionally, the accompanied person must also have adequate health insurance. But how is the accompanied person represented in the graph? Let's assume that the user is linked to the accompanied person via a property, perhaps through their role as caregiver or via closeRelative.\n\nAssuming that the accompanied person is the one being cared for, and the user has a closeRelative to them, then the accompanied person (linked via closeRelative) must also have adequateHealthInsurance = true. But in SHACL, to express that the target (user) has a closeRelative that has adequateHealthInsurance = true, that would require a SHACL path like ff:closeRelative / ff:adequateHealthInsurance. But the shape is on the user, so the user must have a closeRelative, and that person must have adequateHealthInsurance = true.\n\nSo for condition 1, two constraints:\n\n- The user's own adequateHealthInsurance is true.\n\n- The user has at least one closeRelative (or immediateCircleMember) who also has adequateHealthInsurance = true.\n\nWait, but maybe the accompanied person must be the one in the hospital, so perhaps the user's closeRelative is the accompanied person, and that person must have the insurance. But the user must have a closeRelative, and that person must have the insurance. So:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:closeRelative ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n      sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nBut also the user themselves must have adequateHealthInsurance. \n\nSo, first, the user must have adequateHealthInsurance = true.\n\nSecond, the user must have a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember (so, either property) who is the accompanied person, and that person must have adequateHealthInsurance = true.\n\nBut how to express \"closeRelative OR immediateCircleMember\". SHACL allows using sh:or in the path. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have at least one of these properties pointing to a person with the insurance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accompanied person is linked via another property. Maybe the MedicalAccompaniment event involves the accompanied person. Not sure. This part is a bit ambiguous, but given the ontology, perhaps the closest is using the closeRelative or immediateCircleMember.\n\nCondition 2: The accompanied person is in inpatient treatment. The MedicalAccompaniment must be inpatient (inPatientCoAdmission = true). But how is that linked to the user?\n\nAssuming that the MedicalAccompaniment is an event that the accompanied person has (ff:hasEvent). So the accompanied person (linked via closeRelative) must have an event of type MedicalAccompaniment where inPatientCoAdmission is true.\n\nSo, in SHACL, for the user's closeRelative (the accompanied person), they must have an event of type MedicalAccompaniment, which has inPatientCoAdmission = true.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\nff:closeRelative / ff:hasEvent / [ a ff:MedicalAccompaniment ; ff:inPatientCoAdmission true ]\n\nBut how to express this in SHACL. Maybe using sh:sparql, but since we must use only SHACL Core, we have to do it with path expressions.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a closeRelative who has a MedicalAccompaniment event with inPatientCoAdmission true. So:\n\nThe user must have a closeRelative, and that person must have a hasEvent which is a MedicalAccompaniment with inPatientCoAdmission true.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:closeRelative ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:node [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ( ff:hasEvent [ a ff:MedicalAccompaniment ; ff:inPatientCoAdmission \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] ) ;\n      sh:minCount 1\n    ]\n  ]\n]\n\nWait, but SHACL's path can't do such complex filtering in the path. Maybe better to use sh:property with sh:hasValue on the MedicalAccompaniment's inPatientCoAdmission.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a closeRelative who has a MedicalAccompaniment (as an event) where inPatientCoAdmission is true. So, the path would be:\n\nff:closeRelative / ff:hasEvent [ a ff:MedicalAccompaniment ; ff:inPatientCoAdmission true ]\n\nBut I'm not sure if SHACL Core can express that. Maybe using sh:class and sh:hasValue together.\n\nAlternatively, the MedicalAccompaniment is an instance of ff:MedicalAccompaniment, so maybe the path ff:hasEvent has a value of that type, and then the inPatientCoAdmission is true.\n\nHmm, this might require a SPARQL constraint, but since we must use SHACL Core only, perhaps we need to use sh:property with sh:node.\n\nWait, perhaps for the accompanied person (the closeRelative), they must have a hasEvent that is a MedicalAccompaniment with inPatientCoAdmission true.\n\nSo, the accompanied person must have at least one ff:hasEvent that is of type MedicalAccompaniment and has inPatientCoAdmission true.\n\nSo, the shape for the accompanied person (the closeRelative) would need to have:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean\n  ]\n]\n\nBut since we are in the user's shape, we can express that the user's closeRelative must have this property.\n\nCondition 3: The accompaniment is medically necessary, and full-day (8+ hours including travel). The full-day is already covered by ff:fullDayAccompaniment = true on the MedicalAccompaniment. So that's part of condition 2's MedicalAccompaniment.\n\nCondition 4: The user has a Verdienstausfall (loss of earnings). The ontology has the data property ff:causesLossOfEarnings on the Event. The triggering event (perhaps the MedicalAccompaniment) must have this set to true. So the MedicalAccompaniment event must have ff:causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nWait, the MedicalAccompaniment is an Event, so the ff:causesLossOfEarnings is on the event. So the same MedicalAccompaniment that is inPatient must also have causesLossOfEarnings = true.\n\nSo adding that to the previous condition.\n\nSo the MedicalAccompaniment must have both inPatientCoAdmission true and causesLossOfEarnings true.\n\nCondition 5: The user is a close relative or part of the immediate circle. The user must have either ff:closeRelative or ff:immediateCircleMember pointing to the accompanied person. So, the user must have at least one of these properties, and the target must be the same person as the one in the MedicalAccompaniment.\n\nWait, but in SHACL, how to express that? It might be that the user has at least one of the two properties (closeRelative or immediateCircleMember), and that the target of that property is the accompanied person (who is the one in the MedicalAccompaniment). \n\nAlternatively, the user must have at least one of the properties (closeRelative or immediateCircleMember), and the target of that property is the same as the one linked via the MedicalAccompaniment. \n\nBut since SHACL Core doesn't handle transitive relationships easily, perhaps the simplest way is to require that the user has at least one of the properties (closeRelative or immediateCircleMember) pointing to someone (the accompanied person), and that person is the one involved in the MedicalAccompaniment.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have a closeRelative OR immediateCircleMember, and that person must be the accompanied person (so they must exist in the graph linked through those properties).\n\nThis can be done with sh:or in the path for the properties.\n\nSo for the user's closeRelative or immediateCircleMember:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n]\n\nThen, that person must also satisfy the other conditions (insurance, etc).\n\nCondition 6: The accompanied person receives Integration Assistance. The Integration Assistance is ff:IntegrationAssistance (an instance of SocialBenefit). The accompanied person must have a ff:receivesBenefit linked to ff:IntegrationAssistance.\n\nSo the accompanied person (the closeRelative/immediateCircleMember) must have:\n\nff:receivesBenefit ff:IntegrationAssistance.\n\nIn SHACL, for the user's closeRelative (or immediateCircleMember):\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n  sh:minCount 1 ;\n  sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance\n]\n\nAlternatively, the path ff:receivesBenefit must have a value of IntegrationAssistance.\n\nPutting all this together, the SHACL shape for ff:User would have multiple constraints:\n\n1. ff:adequateHealthInsurance is true.\n\n2. The user has a closeRelative or immediateCircleMember (let's call this \"accompaniedPerson\") who:\n\n   a. has adequateHealthInsurance = true\n\n   b. has a MedicalAccompaniment event (ff:hasEvent) with:\n\n      i. inPatientCoAdmission = true\n\n      ii. causesLossOfEarnings = true\n\n      iii. fullDayAccompaniment = true (wait, fullDay is part of the MedicalAccompaniment, which is already required by condition 3)\n\n   c. receives Integration Assistance (ff:IntegrationAssistance via receivesBenefit)\n\nWait, but the MedicalAccompaniment event must also have fullDayAccompaniment true. Oh yes, condition 3 requires that. So in the MedicalAccompaniment's properties, that must be true.\n\nWait, the full-day is part of condition 3, so the MedicalAccompaniment must have ff:fullDayAccompaniment = true.\n\nSo adding that to the MedicalAccompaniment's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the MedicalAccompaniment must have all three: inPatientCoAdmission, causesLossOfEarnings, and fullDayAccompaniment = true.\n\nPutting this into SHACL:\n\nThe user must have at least one of closeRelative or immediateCircleMember, and that person (accompaniedPerson) must satisfy:\n\n- adequateHealthInsurance = true\n\n- has a MedicalAccompaniment event (ff:hasEvent) that is a MedicalAccompaniment instance and has:\n\n   inPatientCoAdmission = true,\n\n   causesLossOfEarnings = true,\n\n   fullDayAccompaniment = true,\n\n- and that accompaniedPerson has receivesBenefit = IntegrationAssistance.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have their own adequateHealthInsurance.\n\nAlso, the user must have a loss of earnings caused by the event (which is covered in the MedicalAccompaniment's causesLossOfEarnings).\n\nNow, let's structure this in SHACL.\n\nThe main shape for ff:User:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 1: User has adequate health insurance\n    sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Condition 5: User has closeRelative or immediateCircleMember\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      # The accompanied person must satisfy the following\n      sh:property [\n        # Accompanied person has adequate health insurance\n        sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        # Accompanied person has a MedicalAccompaniment event with required properties\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n          sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n          sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ]\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        # Accompanied person receives Integration Assistance\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance ;\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n\nWait, but the path for the MedicalAccompaniment must be on the accompanied person's hasEvent. The above structure should do that.\n\nWait, in the SHACL for the accompanied person's shape (within sh:node), the ff:hasEvent must be of class MedicalAccompaniment and have those properties.\n\nBut SHACL allows using sh:class in the path's property to specify the class of the object. Alternatively, the sh:class can be specified in the sh:property with sh:path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using sh:and to require that the hasEvent is a MedicalAccompaniment and has those properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path for ff:hasEvent must be followed by filtering for the class and the properties. But in SHACL Core, this might require a chain of properties.\n\nAlternatively, the accompanied person must have at least one ff:hasEvent that is a MedicalAccompaniment (so sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment) and then the properties on that event.\n\nThe above code should work.\n\nAlso, checking for the Integration Assistance: the accompanied person must have ff:receivesBenefit linked to the individual ff:IntegrationAssistance. So that's covered by sh:hasValue.\n\nAdditionally, condition 6 mentions that the user cannot receive the benefit if they are being paid for the assistance. However, the user's income must not include such a payment. But the problem states that if they are part of the Integration Assistance, the costs are covered by the providers. Since the user must not be receiving payment, perhaps they must not have an income that includes that. But the text says \"Sie erhalten kein Krankengeld von der Krankenkasse, wenn Sie den Menschen mit Behinderung zum Beispiel als persönliche Assistenz begleiten und dafür ein Entgelt erhalten.\" So if the user is being paid (Entgelt), they are ineligible. But how to model that. The problem says the user must not be receiving such payment. So perhaps the user's income must not have an income that is from such assistance. But the ontology has ff:hasIncome, which is an object property to Income. The Income has properties like personalGrossIncome, but not sure if there's a way to check if the income is from that source. Since the text says that if the user is being paid for the assistance, they are ineligible. So perhaps the user must not have an income that comes from such a payment. However, the ontology may not have a property to represent this. Since the problem says \"do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed\", perhaps this exclusion is too vague and cannot be modeled, so we can ignore it.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include the above constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Bedingung 1: User hat gesetzliche Krankenversicherung\n    sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    # Bedingung 5: User ist nahe Angehörige oder Teil des engsten Umfelds der begleiteten Person\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:closeRelative, ff:immediateCircleMember ) ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:node [\n      # Die begleitete Person muss folgende Bedingungen erfüllen:\n      sh:property [\n        # Bedingung 1: Begleitete Person hat ebenfalls gesetzliche Krankenversicherung\n        sh:path ff:adequateHealthInsurance ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        # Bedingung 2 und 3: Begleitete Person hat eine stationäre Behandlung mit medizinisch notwendiger Begleitung\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class ff:MedicalAccompaniment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n          sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n          sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n          sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        ]\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        # Bedingung 6: Begleitete Person bezieht Eingliederungshilfe\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:IntegrationAssistance ;\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL shape for the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' (widow's/widower's pension from statutory accident insurance). The user provided the conditions, so I need to translate those into SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, the target node is ff:User. The requirements are that the user's spouse or civil partner must have died due to an accident (work, commute, or occupational disease), and they were in a legally valid marriage or partnership before the incident. Also, there are exclusion conditions if they married or formed the partnership after the accident and the death was within the first year.\n\nStarting with the main conditions. The user must be linked to their deceased spouse/partner via either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. So, a sh:or constraint with those properties. The object of those properties should be a person (ff:Person), but maybe that's already covered by the ontology. \n\nNext, the cause of death must be one of the allowed accident types. The ontology has ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, or ff:OccupationalDisease as subclasses of ff:Event. The causeOfDeath property links the deceased to the event. So, for the deceased's ff:causeOfDeath, the value must be an instance of one of those three classes. Using sh:hasValue with a union of those classes? Wait, no. Because the value must be an instance of those classes, so maybe sh:class with a union. Alternatively, the path is ff:causeOfDeath, and sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ].\n\nThen, the user must have been in a valid marriage or civil partnership before the accident. The user has a marital status that includes being married or in a civil partnership. Wait, the condition says they must have been in such a relationship before the accident. The ontology has ff:MaritalStatus instances like Married and CivilUnion. The user's ff:hasMaritalStatus must have been valid before the event. But how to represent \"before the accident\"? The event's date must be after the marriage. Hmm, this is tricky because it's a temporal condition. The ontology has ff:hasDate on events. The deceased's causeOfDeath event has a date, and the marriage must have been in place before that date. \n\nWait, but SHACL can't directly compare dates. The user's marital status at the time of the event needs to be in a valid union. Maybe the user must have a marital status that is either Married or CivilUnion, and also there must be a legalUnionBeforeEvent link from the event to the user. Wait, the ontology has ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent which links an event to another person (the partner). Wait the domain is ff:Event. So for the causeOfDeath event (which is the accident), the legalUnionBeforeEvent property should link to the deceased's partner (the user). Wait, maybe the user is linked via the deceased's legalUnionBeforeEvent? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user must have been in a valid union before the accident, so the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user. \n\nAlternatively, the user must have had a marital status of Married or CivilUnion before the accident. Since SHACL can't handle temporal conditions directly, maybe this is captured by requiring that the user's current marital status is either Married or CivilUnion, but that might not be sufficient. The problem is that the condition requires that the union existed before the accident, so maybe we need to link the event to the user via legalUnionBeforeEvent. The event (causeOfDeath) must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user. \n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent is an object property from Event to Person. So for the causeOfDeath (which is the accident event), the ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent should include the user. So, the path would be something like: the user's deceased's causeOfDeath (event) must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user. But how to model that in SHACL?\n\nWait, the user's deceased spouse is linked via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. Let's say the user has a deceasedSpouse :Person. That person's causeOfDeath must be the accident event, and that event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use a SHACL path that navigates through these relationships. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a spouse who died due to an accident, and the accident event must have a legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user. \n\nAlternatively, since the user must have been in the relationship before the event, perhaps the user must have a marital status of Married or CivilUnion, and the event's legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the deceased. Not sure. Maybe it's better to model the marital status as being one of those, but SHACL can't enforce the timing. Since the requirement says \"have been living in a legally valid marriage or partnership before the accident\", perhaps the marital status must be Married or CivilUnion, and the accident's legalUnionBeforeEvent links to the user. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the marital status is already part of the user's data, so the user's hasMaritalStatus must be either Married or CivilUnion. \n\nThe exclusion conditions: the user is ineligible if they entered the marriage/partnership after the accident, and the death occurred within the first year. \n\nSo, for ineligibility, if the user's marriage/partnership was after the accident, and the death was within a year. \n\nBut how to model that in SHACL? Since SHACL can't do temporal checks, maybe the exclusion is handled by requiring that the user did NOT have such a situation. \n\nWait, the user needs to be eligible unless those exclusion conditions apply. But SHACL is for validating that the user meets the criteria, so perhaps the exclusion conditions should be constraints that are negative. \n\nThe exclusion: If the user married/partnered after the accident (i.e., the marriage occurred after the accident's date), and the death happened within the first year of the marriage/partnership. \n\nBut again, without temporal operators in SHACL, it's hard. The ontology has ff:hasDate on events. The event causing the death (the accident) has a date. The marriage/partnership's start date isn't directly modeled here, so maybe this can't be captured. The user's problem says \"if you married after the accident and the death was within the first year of the marriage, then you can't get it\". Since we can't check dates, perhaps this part is ambiguous and we can't model it, so we should exclude it as per the rules. \n\nThe user instructions say to not model requirements that are ambiguous or at discretion of third parties. Since the exclusion condition requires comparing dates which might not be available in the ontology, maybe we can't model that and have to omit it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a property indicating the marriage was after the accident. But the ontology doesn't have such a property. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the exclusion can't be modeled, so we only model the main conditions. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main conditions:\n\n1. User has a deceased spouse or civil partner via ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner.\n\n2. The cause of the spouse/partner's death (ff:causeOfDeath) must be an instance of WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\n3. The user must have been in a valid marriage or civil partnership before the accident. Since SHACL can't check the timing, perhaps the user's marital status must be Married or CivilUnion. \n\nSo, the shape would have:\n\nA shape targeting ff:User with:\n\n- A constraint that there exists at least one of deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner (sh:or with those properties).\n\n- For the causeOfDeath of the deceased, the class must be one of the accident types.\n\nWait, the path would be something like:\n\nFor each ?deceased (either via deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner), their causeOfDeath must be an accident.\n\nSo the path would be:\n\n(ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner) / ff:causeOfDeath \n\nand the value must be a member of the allowed accident types.\n\nBut how to express that in SHACL?\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL constraint where:\n\nThe path is ff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath, and it must be of the allowed classes, or similarly for deceasedCivilPartner.\n\nHmm, this might require a more complex constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as:\n\nThe user must have at least one of the deceased links (spouse or civil partner), and for each such deceased, their causeOfDeath must be an allowed accident. \n\nAlternatively, the shape can have:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) / ff:causeOfDeath;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nWait, but the user might have multiple deceased spouses/partners, so we need at least one of those paths to exist and satisfy the class constraint.\n\nAlternatively, using sh:sparql for more complex conditions, but the user said to use only SHACL Core.\n\nAlternatively, the path is ( ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner ), and the property's value (the deceased person) must have a causeOfDeath of the correct type. But how to chain the properties.\n\nAlternatively, break it into two properties:\n\nFirst, require that the user has at least one deceased spouse or civil partner:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ( ff:deceasedSpouse | ff:deceasedCivilPartner );\n  sh:minCount 1;\n].\n\nSecond, for each such deceased, their causeOfDeath must be an accident type. \n\nBut SHACL can't directly traverse that in a single constraint. Maybe using sh:sparql would be needed, but since we must use Core components, perhaps this is tricky. \n\nHmm, perhaps this requires multiple constraints. For example:\n\nThe user's deceasedSpouse (if exists) must have a causeOfDeath that is one of the allowed types. Similarly for deceasedCivilPartner.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse / ff:causeOfDeath;\n  sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n  sh:or [\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:inversePath ff:deceasedSpouse;  // Not sure\n  ];\n]\n\nNo, that's not right. Maybe it's better to have two separate properties for each deceased link.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have at least one of the deceased links, and for each such deceased, their causeOfDeath must be an accident. Since SHACL can't enforce this per individual, perhaps it's sufficient to require that the causeOfDeath of the deceased (whichever link is used) is of the correct type. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shape can have two constraints: one for each deceased link, but that might be redundant. \n\nAlternatively, the main constraints are:\n\n1. The user has at least one of the deceased links (spouse or civil partner).\n\n2. The causeOfDeath of the deceased (via that link) must be one of the accident types.\n\n3. The user was in a valid marriage/partnership before the accident (modeled as their marital status being Married or CivilUnion).\n\nBut how to express the second part.\n\nWait, the causeOfDeath is a property of the deceased. So, if the user has a deceasedSpouse, then that spouse's causeOfDeath must be an accident. Similarly for civil partner.\n\nPerhaps we can model this with two sh:properties:\n\nFirst, for the deceasedSpouse path:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causeOfDeath;\n      sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    ];\n  ];\n].\n\nSimilarly for deceasedCivilPartner.\n\nThen combine them with sh:or in the main shape.\n\nAlternatively, the shape could have two properties:\n\nOne for deceasedSpouse with the causeOfDeath check, and another for deceasedCivilPartner with the same check, and require that at least one exists.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causeOfDeath;\n      sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    ];\n  ];\n],\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner;\n  sh:qualifiedMinCount 1;\n  sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n    sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:causeOfDeath;\n      sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    ];\n  ];\n],\nsh:or (\n  [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse; sh:minCount 1 ],\n  [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner; sh:minCount 1 ]\n).\n\nWait, but this requires that either of the deceased links exists and their causeOfDeath is correct. So combining these into the shape's properties.\n\nAlso, the marital status must be Married or CivilUnion.\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus;\n  sh:hasValue ff:Married, ff:CivilUnion;\n  sh:or ( [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ], [ sh:hasValue ff:CivilUnion ] );\n].\n\nWait, sh:hasValue requires that the value is exactly one of the listed. So using sh:or with two sh:hasValue constraints.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape would have:\n\nA shape for ff:User with the following properties:\n\n- Either deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner (with the causeOfDeath check).\n\n- The marital status is Married or CivilUnion.\n\nExcluding the exclusion conditions since they involve temporal checks not possible in SHACL Core.\n\nNow, the SHACL code:\n\nThe shape will be named something like ff:WitwenrenteShape.\n\nThe target is ff:User.\n\nFirst, the deceasedSpouse and deceasedCivilPartner parts.\n\nThen the marital status.\n\nSo, in Turtle:\n\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:WitwenrenteShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:or (\n      [\n        sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n          a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      ] ,\n      [\n        sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n          a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n            sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ] ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      ]\n    ) ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ] ,\n      [ sh:hasValue ff:CivilUnion ]\n    ) ;\n  ] ;\n.\n\nWait, but the sh:or is inside the sh:property's sh:or. Alternatively, maybe better to structure it as two separate sh:properties with sh:or.\n\nAlternatively, the first sh:property uses sh:or to allow either deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner, each with their own constraints.\n\nWait, in SHACL, the sh:or in the sh:property would mean that either of the constraints must be true. So each element in the sh:or is a constraint. So each constraint in the or list must be a valid sh:Constraint. \n\nIn this case, each constraint is a sh:path with a qualified shape. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to structure the constraints as:\n\nThe user must have either a deceasedSpouse or a deceasedCivilPartner, and whichever they have, the causeOfDeath must be correct.\n\nSo, the first part ensures that:\n\nEither:\n\n- deceasedSpouse exists and their causeOfDeath is correct,\n\nOR\n\n- deceasedCivilPartner exists and their causeOfDeath is correct.\n\nSo the sh:or includes two constraints:\n\nEach constraint is a sh:path with the respective property and qualified value shape.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nThe marital status part is straightforward with sh:hasValue.\n\nI think that's it. The exclusion conditions can't be modeled because they require date comparisons, so we skip them as per the user's instruction to ignore ambiguous or unmanageable requirements.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:WitwenrenteShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n  \n  sh:property [\n    sh:or (\n      # Condition for deceased spouse with valid cause of death\n      [\n        sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n          a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n            sh:class [ \n              sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) \n            ] ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      ]\n      # Condition for deceased civil partner with valid cause of death\n      [\n        sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n          a sh:NodeShape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n            sh:class [ \n              sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) \n            ] ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n  \n  # Ensure valid marital status before accident (either Married or CivilUnion)\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n    sh:or (\n      [ sh:hasValue ff:Married ] \n      [ sh:hasValue ff:CivilUnion ]\n    )\n  ] ;\n.\n```"
