The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given social benefit description. The benefit is the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Waisenrente' with ID B100019_LB_582435. The target is the ff:User node, and I must ensure the SHACL constraints are correctly applied.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the eligibility conditions carefully. The user receives the Waisenrente if the person died due to an insured event, which includes work accidents, commuting accidents, or occupational diseases. So, I need to model that the deceased had an event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nNext, the user must be a child, stepchild, foster child, grandchild, or sibling of the deceased. I'll use the object property ff:closeRelative to link the user to the deceased. Also, the user must have lived in the same household as the deceased, so I'll use ff:sameHouseholdAs.\n\nThe user must be under 18 or satisfy additional conditions if they're between 18 and 27. Those conditions include being in education, having a disability preventing self-support, or being in a transitional period. I'll use the data properties ff:hasAge to check the age and ff:isInTransitionalPeriod for the transitional phase. For education, I'll link to ff:participates with either ff:VocationalTraining or ff:School. For disability, I'll check ff:hasDisability and whether it's severe with ff:severeDisability.\n\nI also need to ensure the deceased was the primary provider, so I'll use ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker pointing to the deceased.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL shape with each condition as a constraint. I'll make sure each constraint is properly linked and uses the correct properties and classes from the ontology. I'll also ensure that the SHACL syntax is valid and targets the ff:User node as required.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:Shape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [sh:inverse ff:closeRelative] ;\n        sh:or (\n            [sh:path ff:hasChild]\n            [sh:path ff:stepChildTo]\n            [sh:path ff:fosterChildTo]\n            [sh:path ff:naturalChildTo]\n            [sh:path [sh:inverse ff:immediateCircleMember]]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue [sh:inverse ff:deceasedSpouse] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:max 18 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isInTransitionalPeriod ;\n        sh:max 4 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:or (\n            [sh:path ff:VocationalTraining]\n            [sh:path ff:School]\n        )\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasPrimaryCareTaker ;\n        sh:equals [sh:inverse ff:deceasedSpouse]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [sh:inverse ff:resultsInTreatment] ;\n        sh:or (\n            [sh:path ff:WorkAccident]\n            [sh:path ff:CommutingAccident]\n            [sh:path ff:OccupationalDisease]\n        )\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help the user by generating a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Einstiegsgeld'. The user has provided the ontology and the text describing the requirements, so I need to transform that text into a valid SHACL graph.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the requirements. The benefit is for individuals who are about to start a new job or become self-employed and are currently receiving 'Bürgergeld' (citizen benefit). They must apply before starting their new employment, and the new job must have at least 15 hours of work per week. Additionally, for self-employment, the job center must positively assess the applicant's personal suitability and the economic viability of their business.\n\nNow, I need to map these requirements to the provided ontology. The SHACL graph must target the node 'ff:User', so I'll create a shape for that. \n\n1. **Receiving Bürgergeld**: The user must receive 'Bürgergeld', which is represented by 'ff:receivesBenefit' with the value 'ff:B100019_LB_576986'. So, I'll add a property 'ff:receivesBenefit' with 'exactly one' constraint pointing to that individual.\n\n2. **Application Before Employment**: The application must be submitted before starting the new job. This can be checked using a SPARQL query that ensures the application date is before the employment start date. I'll use 'sh:property' with 'sh:path' as 'ff:hasEvent' and a constraint using a SPARQL expression.\n\n3. **New Employment Exists**: The user must have a new employment. I'll use 'ff:hasEmployment' with 'exactly one' constraint.\n\n4. **Employment Hours >=15**: The employment must be at least 15 hours a week. Using 'ff:workHoursPerWeek' with a minimum value of 15.\n\n5. **Positive Job Center Assessment for Self-Employment**: If the user is self-employed, the job center must approve both personal suitability and economic viability. This requires a SPARQL query that checks for the existence of these assessments.\n\nPutting this all together, I'll structure the SHACL graph with each condition as a separate property constraint under the 'ff:User' shape. Each constraint will use the appropriate SHACL components and reference the correct ontology terms.\n\nI need to ensure that the SHACL syntax is correct and that I'm only using SHACL Core components without any extensions. I also must avoid adding any terms not present in the provided ontology. The final graph should be in Turtle syntax, properly formatted and enclosed within triple backticks as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:Shape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path [ sh:property ff:hasEvent sh:zeroOrMore ] ;\n        sh:constraint [\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasDate ] ;\n            sh:maxCount 1 ;\n            sh:lessThan [\n                sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasEmployment sh:property (ff:hasEvent sh:zeroOrMore) sh:property ff:hasDate ] ;\n                sh:maxCount 1 ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path [ sh:property ff:hasEmployment sh:property ff:workHoursPerWeek ] ;\n        sh:minValue 15 ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path [ sh:property ff:hasEmployment sh:property (ff:isSelfEmployed sh:zeroOrMore) sh:property ff:recognizedByLaw ] ;\n        sh:constraint [\n            sh:property [ sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ] ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:constraint [\n            sh:property [ sh:path (ff:recognizedByLaw sh:zeroOrMore) sh:property ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph to validate user data for the 'Kinderzuschlag' benefit. Let me start by understanding the eligibility requirements.\n\nFirst, the user must have a child under 25 who isn't married or in a civil partnership and lives in the same household. So, I'll need to check if the user has a child (using ff:hasChild) whose age is less than 25, marital status is not married or in a civil union, and they live together.\n\nNext, the user must receive child benefit or a similar payment. I'll use ff:receivesBenefit with the specific benefit ID for child allowance.\n\nThen, there are income conditions. Couples need a combined gross income of at least €900/month, and single parents at least €600/month. I'll check the user's income and whether they're a single parent.\n\nThe income used for the allowance shouldn't reduce it to zero, so I'll ensure the calculated amount isn't zero.\n\nThe user must not have significant assets, so I'll check the data property ff:hasConsiderableAssets is false.\n\nThey must be able to cover their family's basic needs with their income and benefits. I'll use ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit.\n\nLastly, the benefit is secondary to other possible income, so the user shouldn't be eligible for other benefits that take priority. I'll use ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the specific benefit ID.\n\nI'll structure these conditions using SHACL shapes, ensuring each condition is a separate shape and all are part of the main shape targeting ff:User.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:KinderzuschlagShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNode ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n            sh:max 24 ;\n            sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n            sh:equals ff:Unmarried ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n            sh:equals ff:User ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576986 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:personalGrossIncome ;\n        sh:minValue 600 ;\n        sh:condition [\n            sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n            sh:equals true ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:familyGrossIncome ;\n        sh:minValue 900 ;\n        sh:condition [\n            sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n            sh:equals false ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n        sh:equals false ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph to validate eligibility for the 'Bürgergeld' benefit based on the given text. Let me go through the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be erwerbsfähig, which means they're capable of working. The SHACL graph needs to ensure that the user has an EarningCapacity. I'll use ff:hasEarningCapacity as the property and set the shape to ensure it's present.\n\nNext, the user must be able to work at least 3 hours a day. The ontology has ff:employableHoursPerDay, which is a data property. I'll add a constraint that this value is at least 3.\n\nThey also need to be at least 15 years old. The ontology has ff:hasAge, so I'll set a minimum of 15 using sh:minInclusive.\n\nThe user shouldn't have reached the pension age. For people born after 1963, it's 67, and earlier births have different limits. Since the ontology doesn't have a specific property for birth year, I'll assume the age limit is 67 and set a maximum age using ff:hasAge with sh:maxExclusive.\n\nThe user must be help-seeking, meaning they can't cover their basic needs. The ontology has ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds, which is a boolean. I'll set this to false using sh:equals.\n\nThey must live in Germany. The property ff:countryOfResidence with value ff:Germany will handle this.\n\nThere should be no prior claims against others. The property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver should exist, indicating no higher-priority benefits.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll define a shape for ff:User with these constraints using the appropriate SHACL properties and values from the ontology.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:BürgergeldEligibilityShape\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:employableHoursPerDay ;\n      sh:minInclusive 3 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n      sh:minInclusive 15 ;\n      sh:maxExclusive 67 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n      sh:equals ff:Germany ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] .\n```"

Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe bekommen können, müssen Sie und Ihre\nBerufsausbildung förderfähig sein.\n\nFörderungsberechtigter Personenkreis:\n\n  * Sie wohnen während der Ausbildung nicht bei Ihren Eltern und der Ausbildungsbetrieb ist vom Elternhaus zu weit entfernt oder Sie \n    * sind mindestens 18 Jahre alt oder\n    * sind oder waren verheiratet oder\n    * haben mindestens ein Kind, das bei Ihnen wohnt.\n  * Auch wenn Sie nicht Deutscher sind, haben Sie grundsätzlich einen Anspruch auf Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe, es sei denn \n    * Sie haben eine Aufenthaltsgestattung nach dem Asylgesetz.\n    * Sie sind geduldet und halten sich seit weniger als 15 Monaten ununterbrochen erlaubt, gestattet oder geduldet in Deutschland auf.\n  * Sie können nicht die erforderlichen Mittel aufbringen, um folgende Kosten zu decken: \n    * Kosten für den Lebensunterhalt\n    * Fahrtkosten zwischen Unterkunft und Ausbildungsstätte oder Berufsschule\n    * Familienheimfahrten\n    * Arbeitskleidung\n    * Kinderbetreuungskosten\n\nFörderungsfähige Berufsausbildung:\n\n  * Es ist Ihre erste Berufsausbildung oder\n  * wenn es nicht Ihre erste Berufsausbildung ist: Sie können nicht auf eine andere Weise dauerhaft beruflich eingegliedert werden.\n  * Sie machen eine Berufsausbildung. \n    * die nach dem Berufsbildungsgesetz, der Handwerksordnung oder dem Seearbeitsgesetz anerkannt ist\n    * oder eine Berufsausbildung nach Teil 2 des Pflegeberufegesetzes.\n  * Sie schließen einen Berufsausbildungsvertrag ab.\n\nWenn Sie eine Behinderung haben, können Sie Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe auch\nbekommen, wenn\n\n  * Sie eine Berufsausbildung machen, die abweichend von den Ausbildungsordnungen für staatlich anerkannte Ausbildungsberufe oder in Sonderformen für behinderte Menschen durchgeführt wird,\n  * Sie Ihre Ausbildung verlängern müssen,\n  * Sie die Ausbildung aufgrund Ihrer Behinderung ganz oder teilweise wiederholen und eine dauerhafte Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben sonst nicht möglich wäre oder\n  * Sie im Haushalt der Eltern oder eines Elternteils wohnen.\n\nZusätzliche Voraussetzung bei berufsvorbereitenden Bildungsmaßnahmen:\n\n  * Die berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme wird im Auftrag der Agentur für Arbeit durchgeführt\n\nEine Ausbildung oder berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme im Ausland ist wie\nfolgt förderfähig:\n\n  * bei teilweiser Ausbildung im Ausland, wenn \n    * der Teil der Ausbildung im Ausland nicht länger als 1 Jahr dauert und\n    * der Teil der Ausbildung im Ausland im Hinblick auf die Gesamtdauer der Ausbildung als angemessen erscheint\n  * bei vollständiger Ausbildung im Ausland, \n    * wenn die Ausbildung im Ausland dem Berufsziel des Antragstellers besonders dienlich ist und\n    * amtlich bestätigt wird, dass die Ausbildung im Ausland einer betrieblichen Ausbildung in Deutschland gleichgestellt ist\n  * bei teilweise im Ausland stattfindender berufsvorbereitender Bildungsmaßname, wenn \n    * der Teil im Ausland die Hälfte der vorgesehenen Förderdauer nicht übersteigt und\n    * der Teil im Ausland im Hinblick auf die Gesamtdauer der Maßnahme als angemessen erscheint.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph based on the eligibility requirements for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' benefit. The target is always the node \"ff:User\". Let me go through the text step by step and map the conditions to SHACL constraints.\n\nFirst, the benefit is for users who are 18 or older, married, divorced, widowed, or have a child living with them. They must not be living with their parents, and the training location should be too far from their parents' home. So, I'll create a shape for ff:User with these conditions. I'll use sh:or to combine these options because the user needs to meet at least one.\n\nNext, non-Germans can apply unless they have an asylum seeker status or have been in Germany for less than 15 months. I'll add a constraint that the user's residence status is not ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits and they've been in Germany for more than 15 months without interruption.\n\nThe user must not have enough means to cover living costs, travel, family visits, work clothes, and childcare. I'll express this with ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds set to false.\n\nFor the training to be eligible, it must be their first vocational training or they can't integrate into the workforce otherwise. I'll use ff:isFirstVocationalTraining and sh:or with ff:isVocationalReturnee. The training should be recognized under specific laws, so I'll include ff:recognizedByLaw with the appropriate legal codes.\n\nIf the user has a disability, additional conditions apply, such as special training formats or living with parents. I'll create a separate shape for ff:Disability linked through ff:hasDisabilityType.\n\nLastly, the training must be in Germany or meet specific criteria if abroad. I'll use ff:countryOfEmployment to check if it's in Germany and handle exceptions for partial or full foreign training with the relevant constraints.\n\nI need to ensure all terms are from the provided ontology and use only SHACL Core components. I'll structure each condition as a separate shape and combine them using sh:and and sh:or as needed.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inverse ff:isEligibleFor ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_574724 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:min 18 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Married ff:Divorced ff:Widowed ) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasChild ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape [\n            sh:path ff:naturalChildTo ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:UserShape ;\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfResidence ;\n        sh:equals ff:Germany ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasResidenceStatus ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Tolerated ) ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:Literal ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\" ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:node ff:FullEarningCapacity ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\" ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n        sh:in ( ff:Berufsbildungsgesetz ff:Handwerksordnung ff:Seearbeitsgesetz ff:Pflegeberufegesetz ) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n        sh:node ff:VocationalTrainingContract ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:countryOfEmployment ;\n        sh:equals ff:Germany ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:needsCare ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ; sh:node ff:SevereDisability ]\n        ) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph to validate eligibility for the 'Kindergeld' social benefit based on the provided text and ontology. Let's break down the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the target is always the node \"ff:User\". So, I'll start by creating a shape for ff:User.\n\nLooking at the text, the eligibility conditions for parents and children are outlined. I'll separate these into two main sections: parent conditions and child conditions.\n\nFor the parents:\n\n1. The user must have unlimited tax liability in Germany. In the ontology, this is represented by ff:incomeTaxLiability with the value ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability. So, I'll add a property constraint for ff:incomeTaxLiability with a value set containing ff:UnlimitedTaxLiability.\n\n2. Alternatively, the user could be a citizen of EU, EWR, or Switzerland. The ontology has ff:isNationalOf, but I need to check if there's a class for these countries. The ontology has ff:EEAplusCH, which includes EEA and Switzerland. So, I can create a class for these countries and set an OR condition for either unlimited tax liability or being a national of an EEAplusCH country.\n\nWait, but the user could also be an EU citizen without necessarily being a national. Maybe it's better to model this as a union, but since the text says \"Staatangehörige der EU, des EWR oder der Schweiz\", which translates to nationals, I think using ff:isNationalOf is correct.\n\nAdditionally, for EU citizens moving to Germany after August 2019, they must meet certain conditions. This includes being self-employed, employed, job-seeking, deriving rights from a family member, having sufficient means and health insurance, or having permanent residence. These are a bit complex and might involve multiple properties. However, some of these conditions are discretionary or based on third-party assessments, which I should avoid modeling according to the rules. So, I might not include these as they can't be clearly assessed.\n\nNext, the user could have a valid settlement permit or another residence title that allows employment, or be a recognized refugee or entitled to asylum. In the ontology, ff:hasResidencePermit can be used, and I can check if the permit allows employment with ff:entitlesToEmployment. Alternatively, ff:recognizedRefugee or ff:entitledToAsylum are data properties that can be set to true.\n\nSo, I'll create a property constraint for ff:incomeTaxLiability and then an OR condition for either being a national of EEAplusCH, having a valid residence permit that allows employment, or being a recognized refugee or entitled to asylum.\n\nFor the child:\n\nThe child must reside in Germany, another EU country, EWR, or Switzerland. The ontology has ff:countryOfResidence, and I can use ff:EEAplusCH again. So, I'll create a property constraint where the child's country of residence is part of ff:EEAplusCH.\n\nAdditionally, if the child lives in the EU/EWR/Switzerland but the parent is taxed in Germany, there's an alternative condition. This might be more complex, but perhaps it's sufficient to just check the child's residence.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL graph with the necessary property constraints and logical ORs where applicable.\n\nI need to make sure all terms are from the ontology and that the SHACL is syntactically correct. I'll use only Core components, so no advanced features.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph based on the eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Ausbildungsgeld' with the IDLB B100019_LB_574711. The target is always the node \"ff:User\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the conditions provided:\n\n1. The user has a disability and their responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit).\n2. The user is participating in one of the specified training measures.\n3. The user has no claim to transition allowance (Übergangsgeld).\n\nNow, I'll break down each condition and map it to the ontology.\n\nStarting with the first condition: The user has a disability. In the ontology, there's a data property ff:hasDisability with range xsd:boolean. So, I'll set a constraint that ff:hasDisability must be true.\n\nNext, the responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency. The ontology has an object property ff:hasRehabilitationProvider with range ff:RehabilitationProvider. The individual ff:FederalEmploymentAgency is an instance of ff:RehabilitationProvider. So, I'll create a constraint that the user's rehabilitation provider must be ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nMoving to the second condition: The user participates in one of the listed training measures. The ontology has an object property ff:participates with range ff:Training. The measures mentioned correspond to different types of training. I'll use the property ff:participates and set the allowed values to the specific training types. However, looking at the ontology, I see that ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is a subclass of ff:Training. So, I can use this class to represent the specific measure. I'll create a constraint that the user must participate in an instance of ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nThe third condition is that the user has no claim to transition allowance. The ontology has an object property ff:isIneligibleFor with range ff:SocialBenefit. The individual ff:B100019_LB_102716305 represents the transition allowance. So, I'll set a constraint that the user is ineligible for this benefit.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure each condition as a separate shape within the SHACL graph, ensuring each constraint is properly defined and targets the ff:User node. I'll also make sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax in Turtle format.\n\nI should also ensure that I don't invent any new terms and only use the provided ontology. Each constraint must be clear and unambiguous, avoiding any discretionary assessments. I'll double-check each property and class to confirm they exist in the ontology and correctly represent the conditions.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize the SHACL graph in Turtle syntax, making sure it's syntactically valid and properly formatted within triple backticks as specified.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n    sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:maxCount 1 ;\n    sh:equals true ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:class ff:RehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:equals ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n  ] , [\n    sh:path ff:isIneligibleFor ;\n    sh:class ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    sh:equals ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n  ] .\n```"

Mit Ihrer persönlichen Arbeitslosmeldung gilt das Arbeitslosengeld als beantragt. Zusätzlich muss noch ein Antragsformular ausgefüllt werden;\n  * Sie innerhalb der letzten 30 Monate vor der Arbeitslosmeldung (der sogenannten Rahmenfrist) mindestens 12 Monate versicherungspflichtig waren. \n    * Es werden auch Zeiten berücksichtigt, in denen Sie wegen des Bezuges von Entgeltersatzleistungen, wie zum Beispiel Krankengeld, oder - unter weiteren Voraussetzungen - zum Beispiel wegen der Pflege eines Angehörigen oder der Erziehung eines Kindes versicherungspflichtig zur Arbeitsförderung waren.\n    * Als Versicherungszeit können auch Zeiten berücksichtigt werden, in denen ein Antragspflichtversicherungsverhältnis (sogenannte freiwillige Weiterversicherung) vorlag, zum Beispiel  weil Sie eine selbständige Tätigkeit aufgenommen haben.\n    * In Sonderfällen werden auch Zeiten berücksichtigt, in denen Sie Entwicklungsdienst nach dem Entwicklungshelfergesetz geleistet haben oder Sie auf der Grundlage eines Sekundierungsvertrages im Ausland tätig waren.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the eligibility requirements for \"Arbeitslosengeld\" (unemployment benefit) with the ID B100019_LB_576842. The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints will apply to instances of this class.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the eligibility criteria from the provided text:\n\n1. **Employment Status**: The user must be unemployed. This means they are not in an employment relationship, or if they are, it's for less than 15 hours a week. Additionally, they must be available for the employment agency's placement efforts.\n\n2. **Registration**: The user must have registered as unemployed either electronically with an ID or in person at the employment agency. If done in person, the registration also serves as the application.\n\n3. **Insurance Period**: Within the last 30 months before registration, the user must have been subject to compulsory insurance for at least 12 months. This includes periods where they received benefits like sick pay or were caring for a family member or raising a child. Self-employment periods under voluntary continued insurance and certain foreign service times also count.\n\nNow, I'll map these criteria to the SHACL constraints using the provided ontology.\n\n**1. Employment Status**:\n- **ff:inEmployment**: This should be false because they shouldn't be in a regular employment relationship.\n- **ff:workHoursPerWeek**: If employed, it should be less than 15 hours.\n- **ff:availableForPlacement**: Must be true, indicating willingness to take up employment.\n\n**2. Registration**:\n- **ff:hasEmploymentStatus**: The user must have a status of \"RegisteredUnemployed\".\n\n**3. Insurance Period**:\n- **ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30**: This data property must be true, indicating the user meets the 12-month requirement within the last 30 months.\n\nI'll structure these constraints into a SHACL shape, ensuring each is properly linked and uses the correct logical connectors. Since SHACL Core doesn't support disjunctions directly, I'll use conjunctions where possible and separate shapes for different conditions.\n\nI also need to ensure that all terms used are from the provided ontology to avoid inventing new ones. Each constraint is clearly defined, avoiding ambiguous requirements. For example, the 12-month insurance period is a clear, verifiable condition.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize the graph in Turtle syntax, making sure it's syntactically valid and enclosed within triple backticks as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UnemploymentBenefitEligibilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:inEmployment ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:equals false ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:workHoursPerWeek ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:lessThan 15 ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:equals ff:RegisteredUnemployed ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:maxCount 1 ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' (IDLB B100019_LB_102799525). The user has provided a detailed ontology and the specific conditions that must be met.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements. The first condition is that the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance. Looking at the ontology, I see that 'isEligibleFor' links a person to a social benefit. So, I'll use this property and set the value to the specific benefit individual, which I assume is 'B100019_LB_102799525' as it's the ID given, but I need to check if it's already defined. Since it's not listed in the provided ontology, I might need to create a new individual or refer to it correctly.\n\nWait, in the ontology, I see 'B100019_LB_102716305' is defined as 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld' and similar entries. So, I should check if 'B100019_LB_102799525' exists. If not, I might have to assume it's a typo or create it. But since I can't invent terms, I'll proceed with the correct ID provided in the text.\n\nThe second condition is that the user has remarried or entered a new civil partnership after the death of their spouse/partner. In the ontology, 'hasMaritalStatus' links to a marital status. The possible statuses include 'Married', 'Widowed', 'Divorced', 'CivilUnion'. I need to model that the user's marital status is 'Widowed' and that they have a new spouse or partner.\n\nWait, the condition is about remarrying or entering a new civil union after being widowed. So, I need to check if the user is currently married or in a civil union and was previously widowed. But in SHACL, I can model this by checking if the user's marital status is 'Married' or 'CivilUnion' and that they have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\n\nSo, for the second condition, I'll use 'hasMaritalStatus' with 'Married' or 'CivilUnion', and also check if they have a deceased spouse or civil partner using 'deceasedSpouse' or 'deceasedCivilPartner'.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL graph will target 'ff:User' and include two conditions:\n\n1. The user is eligible for 'B100019_LB_102799525'.\n2. The user's marital status is either 'Married' or 'CivilUnion', and they have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\n\nI need to ensure that the SHACL syntax is correct, using 'a' to denote the shape, 'sh:targetClass' to target 'ff:User', and 'sh:property' with 'sh:hasValue' for each condition.\n\nI should also make sure that all used terms are present in the ontology. Since 'B100019_LB_102799525' isn't listed, but the structure is, I'll assume it's correct as given.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize this in Turtle syntax within triple backticks as required.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102799525 ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Married , ff:CivilUnion ;\n    ] , [\n        sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse , ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n        sh:hasValue [] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the provided eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung' with IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I must use the given ontology without introducing new terms.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the conditions:\n\n1. The user receives basic security benefits. In the ontology, this is represented by ff:receivesBenefit pointing to ff:B100019_LB_102716305, which is the basic security benefit.\n\n2. The necessity for support was determined in a discussion with the integration specialist. The ontology has ff:needsCare, which links a person to their care needs. So, I'll use ff:needsCare to an instance of ff:CareNeed, and then link that to the integration specialist, but wait, the ontology doesn't have a specific property for integration specialists. Maybe I should just state that the care need exists without specifying the specialist since the ontology doesn't support it.\n\n3. Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure began. The ontology has ff:approvedBy for approvals, but I need to check if it's applicable here. Wait, looking back, I see ff:approvedBy is a property, but in the given ontology, I don't see it listed. Hmm, perhaps I should use ff:hasEvent with a suitable event type. Alternatively, maybe ff:receivesBenefit can be used with a condition. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a node for the approval, but I need to stick strictly to the ontology.\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:hasEvent, which can link a person to an event. So, I can create an instance of an event, say :ApprovalEvent, and link it to the Jobcenter. But the ontology doesn't have a specific event type for approvals, so I might need to use a generic ff:Event.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use ff:receivesBenefit with the specific benefit and add constraints on it. Alternatively, maybe I can model the approval as a condition. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the approval is a required condition, perhaps I can model it as a property. But the ontology doesn't have a direct property for approval by Jobcenter. So maybe I can't model this condition as it's ambiguous without specific terms.\n\nWait, the user must receive the basic security benefit, so I can model that. The other conditions involve discussions and approvals, which may not have direct mappings. Since I can't invent terms, I might have to omit those or find alternative properties.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use ff:hasEvent to indicate that the user has an event where the participation was approved. But without a specific property, it might not be precise. Alternatively, maybe the approval is part of the benefit itself, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition about the discussion with the integration specialist can be modeled using ff:needsCare, linking to a CareNeed, but without specifying the specialist since the ontology doesn't have that.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n- The user must receive the basic security benefit: ff:receivesBenefit ff:B100019_LB_102716305.\n- The user must have a care need: ff:needsCare _:careNeed, where _:careNeed is of type ff:CareNeed.\n- The participation was approved by the Jobcenter: This might require a property like ff:approvedBy, but since it's not in the ontology, perhaps I can't model it directly. So, I might have to omit this condition as it can't be clearly assessed without the specific term.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL graph will include the first two conditions, as the third depends on a property not present in the ontology.\n</think>\n\nBased on the social benefit description and the provided ontology, the SHACL graph will validate users based on receiving the basic security benefit and having a care need. The approval condition is omitted due to lack of specific terms in the ontology.\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:receivesBenefit ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:needsCare ;\n      sh:class ff:CareNeed ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility criteria for the social benefit 'Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung'. The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints should apply to instances of this class.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the text into individual requirements:\n\n1. **High-degree visual or hearing impairment or at risk of such impairment.**\n   - This translates to checking if the user has a severe disability (ff:severeDisability) and whether it's a visual or hearing impairment. Since the ontology has ff:VisualImpairment and ff:HearingImpairment as subclasses of ff:Disability, I can use these. Alternatively, using ff:hasDisabilityType with these specific types would also work.\n\n2. **The responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit).**\n   - The user must have a rehabilitation provider (ff:hasRehabilitationProvider) set to ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n3. **Prospects for participating in working life are significantly reduced due to the nature and severity of the disability, and assistance is needed.**\n   - This implies that the disability reduces work prospects permanently (ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently) and that the user is unfit for work (ff:unfitForWork). Alternatively, checking if the earning capacity is reduced (ff:unfitForWork might be a data property under ff:EarningCapacity).\n\n4. **Willingness to undergo vocational training or integration.**\n   - The user must be willing to participate in training, which can be represented by ff:availableForPlacement being true.\n\nNow, considering the SHACL constraints:\n\n- **Property Constraints:** For each property, I'll define a sh:property and specify the constraints using sh:hasValue, sh:minCount, or other components.\n\n- **Class Constraints:** Ensure that the user is an instance of ff:User, but since the shape targets this node, it's implicit.\n\nI need to use only SHACL Core components, so I'll avoid advanced features. Each condition will be a separate shape or part of a shape.\n\nI also need to ensure that the ontology terms are used correctly. For example, ff:hasDisabilityType links to ff:Disability, and since ff:VisualImpairment and ff:HearingImpairment are subclasses, using them as objects makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create a shape for ff:User with each constraint as a property. Each property will have the appropriate value or condition. I'll make sure the Turtle syntax is correct, using prefixes and proper structure.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:VisualImpairment, ff:HearingImpairment ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n  ] ,\n  [\n    sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n  ] ,\n  [\n    sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] ,\n  [\n    sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha' with IDLB B100019_LB_582422. The user has provided an ontology and a text description, so I'll start by understanding both.\n\nFirst, the text outlines two main conditions:\n1. The person must have experienced a work accident, commuting accident, or an occupational disease.\n2. The person must be participating in a qualified measure for vocational rehabilitation.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I see relevant classes and properties. For the first condition, the ontology has classes like ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, and ff:OccupationalDisease, all of which are subclasses of ff:Event. The property ff:hasEvent can link a person to these events.\n\nFor the second condition, the ontology has ff:participates, which links a person to a training program. The training should be a berufliche Reha, which I believe corresponds to ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nI need to model these conditions using SHACL. The target is always ff:User, so I'll create a shape for that class. Each condition will be a constraint using sh:property, sh:class, and sh:hasValue where appropriate.\n\nI'll start by defining a shape for ff:User. The first constraint checks if the user has an event of type work or commuting accident or occupational disease. I'll use sh:or to combine these possibilities. Each event type is a class, so sh:class with the respective class IRI.\n\nNext, the second constraint ensures the user participates in an occupational rehabilitation program. Here, I'll use ff:participates with sh:class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other constraints, but the text only specifies these two, so I'll stick to them.\n\nNow, I'll structure the Turtle syntax. I'll define the shape with a name, target ff:User, and add each constraint as a property with the appropriate values. Using sh:or for the first condition ensures that any of the event types satisfy the constraint.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct, using the correct prefixes and class/property IRIs. I'll also ensure that the shape is properly named and that each constraint is correctly formulated.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize the shape graph in Turtle and enclose it within triple backticks as instructed.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n    a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or (\n                ff:WorkAccident\n                ff:CommutingAccident\n                ff:OccupationalDisease\n            )\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SHACL graph based on the eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Insolvenzgeld' with the ID LB B100019_LB_576848. The target is the node \"ff:User\", and I have to make sure the SHACL constraints are syntactically valid and only use the Core components.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the eligibility conditions provided in the text. The conditions are:\n\n1. There must be an insolvency event, which can be one of three scenarios:\n   a. Opening of insolvency proceedings against the employer's assets.\n   b. Insolvency application rejected due to lack of assets.\n   c. Business operations ceased completely due to obvious lack of assets.\n\n2. Before the insolvency event, the user didn't receive any wages for up to 3 months.\n\n3. The user must be an employee either:\n   a. Employed within Germany.\n   b. Temporarily sent abroad but still under German social security.\n\n4. The user must provide proof from the Clearing Office of the German Pension Insurance (Statusfeststellungsverfahren) that they are legally considered an employee. This is especially if they are in specific roles like a managing partner, GmbH shareholder, or a relative of the employer.\n\nNow, I'll map these conditions to the ontology provided.\n\nStarting with the first condition, the insolvency event. The ontology has ff:InsolvencyProceeding as a class, and properties like ff:employer, ff:hasEvent, and data properties like ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets and ff:obviousLackOfAssets.\n\nSo, I'll create a shape for ff:User that checks if they have an event of type ff:InsolvencyProceeding. Then, for that event, I'll create a shape that checks for one of the three scenarios using sh:or. Each scenario will be a separate condition.\n\nNext, the second condition about not receiving wages for up to 3 months. The ontology has ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver, but I'm not sure if that directly applies. Alternatively, maybe using a data property like ff:unfitForWork or ff:availableForPlacement, but those don't seem to fit. Wait, perhaps the condition is about the user not receiving income, so maybe using ff:personalGrossIncome with a condition that it's zero for the relevant period. But the ontology doesn't have a specific property for that, so maybe I need to model it differently. Alternatively, perhaps using ff:hasIncome with a constraint on the amount, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to create a shape that checks if the user has no income for the period, but without a specific property, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using ff:unfitForWork or similar, but I'm not certain. I'll need to think about this.\n\nWait, the text says \"Vor dem Insolvenzereignis wurde Ihnen bis zu 3 Monate lang kein Arbeitsentgelt gezahlt.\" So, no wage payments for up to 3 months before the event. The ontology has ff:inEmployment, which is a boolean. So perhaps the user must not be in employment during that period. But I'm not sure how to model the time aspect. SHACL doesn't handle temporal constraints directly, so maybe I can't model this precisely. Alternatively, perhaps using ff:unfitForWork, but that's more about capacity than payment. Hmm, this might be a point where I can't model it clearly, so I might have to skip it or find an alternative.\n\nMoving on to the third condition: the user must be an employee in Germany or temporarily abroad under German social security. The ontology has ff:countryOfEmployment, ff:socialSecurityCountry, and data properties like ff:inEmployment. So, I can create a shape that checks if the user's employment is in Germany or if they are posted abroad but still under German social security.\n\nFor the fourth condition, the user must have a status confirmation from the pension insurance. The ontology has ff:isEligibleFor, which links to ff:SocialBenefit. So, perhaps the user must be eligible for a specific benefit that indicates this status.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL graph with the following shapes:\n\n1. A shape for ff:User that checks for the insolvency event.\n2. A shape for the insolvency event that checks one of the three scenarios.\n3. A shape for the user's employment status in Germany or abroad under German social security.\n4. A shape for the user being eligible for the specific social benefit indicating employee status.\n\nI'll use sh:property to link the user to the event and employment, and sh:or to handle the alternative conditions for the insolvency event.\n\nI need to ensure that all properties and classes used are from the provided ontology and that I don't invent any new terms. I'll also make sure to use only SHACL Core components without any extensions.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize the graph in Turtle syntax, ensuring it's syntactically valid and enclosed within triple backticks as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:hasEvent ;\n      sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:BlankNode ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:predicate ff:employer ;\n          sh:class ff:Employer ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:predicate a ;\n          sh:in (\n              ff:OpenProceeding ,\n              ff:RejectedForLackOfAssets\n          ) ;\n          sh:xone (\n              [\n                  sh:predicate ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ;\n                  sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n                  sh:equals true ;\n              ]\n              [\n                  sh:predicate ff:obviousLackOfAssets ;\n                  sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n                  sh:equals true ;\n              ]\n          )\n      ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:hasEmployment ;\n      sh:class ff:Employment ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:predicate ff:countryOfEmployment ;\n          sh:in (\n              ff:Germany\n          )\n      ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:isEligibleFor ;\n      sh:class ff:SocialBenefit ;\n      sh:in (\n          ff:B100019_LB_576848\n      )\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Verletztengeld' (accident insurance benefit). The target is the node \"ff:User\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the requirements. The user must receive Verletztengeld if they are unable to work due to an insured event. Insured events include work accidents, commuting accidents, and occupational diseases.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I see relevant classes and properties. The user is of type ff:Person. The property ff:unfitForWork (arbeitsunfähig) indicates if they're unable to work. The events are instances of ff:Event, specifically ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident (Wegeunfall), and ff:OccupationalDisease (Berufskrankheit).\n\nI need to shape this into SHACL constraints. The shape will target ff:User. It should check if the user has an event (ff:hasEvent) that is one of the specified events and that they are unfit for work.\n\nSo, I'll create a shape with two conditions using sh:property and sh:hasValue. The first condition checks for the specific events, and the second checks if the user is unfit for work.\n\nI must ensure the SHACL is syntactically correct, using only Core components, and not inventing any terms. I'll serialize it in Turtle and enclose it properly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:WorkAccident, ff:CommutingAccident, ff:OccupationalDisease ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:unfitForWork ;\n    sh:hasValue true ;\n  ] .\n```"

Lebensjahr vollendet haben und dauerhaft voll erwerbsgemindert nach § 43 Abs. 2 SGB VI sind oder\n  * das 18. Lebensjahr vollendet haben und\n  * in einer Werkstatt für behinderte Menschen oder anderer Leistungsträger das Eingangsverfahren und den Berufsbildungsbereich durchlaufen oder in einem Ausbildungsverhältnis stehen, für das sie ein Budget für Ausbildung erhalten.\n\nSozialhilfe ist eine nachrangige Leistung, die Personen erhalten, die sich\nnicht selbst helfen können. Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere\nUnterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen. Werden sie\nnicht rechtzeitig erfüllt und muss deswegen die Sozialhilfe eintreten, gehen\ndie Ansprüche unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen auf die zuständige Stelle über,\nwelche sie dann ihrerseits geltend machen kann.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Grundsicherung im Alter und bei Erwerbsminderung' (ID: L100040_LB_8664880). The target is the node \"ff:User\".\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text to understand the conditions. The benefit is for people who are in need and can't cover their living expenses through income or assets. They must meet one of three criteria:\n\n1. Reached the age limit under §41 SGB XII.\n2. Are over 18 and permanently fully incapacitated for work under §43(2) SGB VI.\n3. Are over 18, went through a specific procedure in a workshop for the disabled, or are in a training contract with a training budget.\n\nAlso, social assistance is a last resort, so applicants must first try to get support from others (like family) before applying.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to map these conditions using available properties and classes.\n\nFor condition 1, the data property ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit (boolean) fits. So, a sh:property condition with sh:p ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit and sh:hasValue true.\n\nCondition 2: The user must be over 18 (ff:hasAge > 18) and have a severe disability. The data property ff:severeDisability (boolean) under ff:Disability can be used. Also, the property ff:hasDisabilityType links to ff:Disability, which has ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently true. So, a sh:property for ff:hasAge with a minimum of 19 (since 18 is the threshold, but completed years), and another for ff:hasDisabilityType with a sh:nodeKind sh:Literal and sh:equals true for severe disability.\n\nCondition 3: The user is over 18 and participates in a specific training. The object property ff:participates with ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea. So, a sh:property for ff:participates with sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nThe last part about social assistance being secondary means the user must not be eligible for other benefits with higher priority. The object property ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with the benefit ID. So, a sh:property for ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver with sh:object ff:L100040_LB_8664880.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL shape with these conditions using logical OR (sh:or) and AND (sh:and) as needed. Each condition is a separate shape, combined appropriately.\n\nI need to ensure the SHACL is syntactically correct, only use core components, and not invent new terms. I'll serialize it in Turtle syntax within triple backticks.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n      sh:minInclusive 19 ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n      sh:nodeKind sh:Literal ;\n      sh:equals true ;\n      sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:path ff:participates ;\n      sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n    ] ;\n  sh:or (\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:aboveSGBXII41AgeLimit ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:minInclusive 19 ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:int ;\n      ] ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n        sh:nodeKind sh:Literal ;\n        sh:equals true ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:boolean ;\n      ] ;\n    ] ,\n    [\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n      ] ;\n    ]\n  ) ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n    sh:object ff:L100040_LB_8664880 ;\n  ] .\n```"

Lebensjahr noch nicht vollendet hat,\n  * Sie vor der Beaufsichtigung, Betreuung oder Pflege Ihres Kindes einen Anspruch auf Arbeitsentgelt oder eine andere Geldleistung (zum Beispiel Krankengeld, Arbeitslosengeld) hatten und\n  * keine andere in Ihrem Haushalt lebende Person Ihr Kind betreuen kann.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Kinderverletztengeld'. The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints will apply to instances of this class.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Household Child Requirement**: The user must have a child in their household who needs supervision, care, or nursing due to a school or kindergarten accident. This translates to checking if the user has a child (using ff:hasChild) who has a care need (ff:CareNeed) caused by a school or kindergarten accident (ff:SchoolAccident or ff:KindergartenAccident).\n\n2. **Age Limit**: The child must be under 12 years old. I'll use ff:hasAge on the child node with a maximum value of 11 (since 12 is excluded).\n\n3. **Employment Status**: Before caring for the child, the user must have had a right to remuneration, such as salary or unemployment benefits. This can be checked using ff:inEmployment or ff:hasEmploymentStatus with specific values, but since the ontology doesn't have a direct property for this, I'll use ff:isRenumerated from the event caused by the child's care need.\n\n4. **No Other Caregiver in Household**: There should be no other household member able to care for the child. I'll use a negated property (negated by sh:not) to check that there's no other person in the same household (ff:sameHouseholdAs) who can provide care.\n\nI need to ensure all these conditions are met, so I'll use sh:and to combine them. Each condition is a separate shape, so I'll define them as part of the main shape using sh:property and sh:shape.\n\nI must use only SHACL Core components and avoid any ambiguous requirements. I'll also make sure to serialize everything in Turtle syntax within triple backticks as required.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inverse ff:hasChild ] ;\n    sh:shape [\n      a sh:Shape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:needsCare ;\n        sh:shape [\n          a sh:Shape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n            sh:shape [\n              a sh:Shape ;\n              sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:resultsInTreatment ;\n                sh:shape ff:SchoolAccident, ff:KindergartenAccident\n              ]\n            ]\n          ]\n        ]\n      ] ;\n      sh:maxCount 1 ;\n      sh:minCount 1\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inverse ff:hasChild ] ;\n    sh:shape [\n      a sh:Shape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:max 11 ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:int\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inverse ff:hasChild ] ;\n    sh:shape [\n      a sh:Shape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:resultsInTreatment ;\n        sh:shape [\n          a sh:Shape ;\n          sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:isRenumerated ;\n            sh:hasValue true\n          ]\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n    sh:shape [\n      a sh:Shape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n        sh:hasValue false\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n    sh:shape [\n      a sh:Shape ;\n      sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue true\n      ]\n    ]\n  ] .\n```"

Der\nLeistungsanspruch gilt für Kinder und junge Menschen bis zur Vollendung des\n25. Lebensjahres. Leistungen zur Teilhabe am sozialen und kulturellen Leben in\nder Gemeinschaft werden bis zur Vollendung des 18. Lebensjahres bezuschusst.\n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the provided eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Bildung und Teilhabe'. The target is the node \"ff:User\", so all constraints will apply to instances of this class.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key points from the text. The benefit is for young people if they or their families receive certain benefits like Bürgergeld, Wohngeld, Sozialhilfe, Asylbewerberleistungen, or have low income. Alternatively, they can apply if they can't afford the costs themselves. The age limit is up to 25, but some benefits stop at 18.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I see relevant properties and classes. For the benefits, I'll use ff:receivesBenefit with the specific individuals like ff:B100019_LB_102716305 for Bürgergeld. Since the text mentions multiple benefits, I'll use a property chain with sh:property and sh:zeroOrMorePath to cover all possible cases.\n\nFor the age constraint, the data property ff:hasAge will be used. I'll set sh:max to 25. But for some benefits, the max is 18, so I'll create another shape for that.\n\nI also need to handle cases where the user can't afford the costs themselves. This is a bit tricky since the text doesn't specify an exact data property for this. However, ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds is a boolean, so I can invert it using sh:equals with false to indicate they can't cover their needs.\n\nI'll structure the SHACL graph with a main shape for ff:User, using sh:or to combine the different eligibility paths. Each path will check for receiving a specific benefit or the inability to cover costs. I'll also include the age constraints within these shapes.\n\nI need to ensure that the SHACL is syntactically correct and only uses core components. I'll avoid any ambiguous requirements and stick to the provided ontology terms.\n\nFinally, I'll serialize everything in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks as specified.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:NodeShape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath ff:receivesBenefit ] ;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath ff:receivesBenefit ] ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:L100040_LB_8665924 ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath ff:receivesBenefit ] ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path [ sh:zeroOrMorePath ff:receivesBenefit ] ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:AsylumSeekerBenefits ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n    ] ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:max 25 ;\n  ] ;\n  sh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n    sh:max 18 ;\n    sh:or [\n      sh:path ff:canCoverPersonalBasicNeeds ;\n      sh:equals false ;\n    ] ;\n  ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Übergangsgeld für Menschen mit Behinderung' (IDLB B100019_LB_102716305). The target is the node \"ff:User\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the conditions:\n\n1. The user must have a disability and require special support for occupational integration. The responsible rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency.\n\n2. The user must participate in one of the specified training measures.\n\n3. Within the last 3 years, the user must have either:\n   - Been socially insured for at least 12 months,\n   - Have a claim to unemployment benefits under SGB III and have applied for them, or\n   - Be entitled to unemployment assistance under the Soldiers' Pension Act.\n\nThere are exceptions:\n- If the user is a vocational returnee with a disability, the 3-year employment history condition doesn't apply.\n- The employment history condition can be waived if within the last year before the measure begins, the user obtained a recognized vocational training qualification.\n\nI'll model each condition as a SHACL shape. I'll use property constraints for each requirement, ensuring they are connected to the ff:User node. I'll also handle the exceptions by using sh:or and sh:condition to exclude certain cases when specific properties are met.\n\nI need to make sure all terms used are from the provided ontology and that the SHACL is syntactically correct. I'll use Turtle syntax for the output.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:predicate ff:hasDisability ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:predicate ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:predicate ff:participates ;\n      sh:in (\n        ff:VocationalTraining ,\n        ff:Berufsvorbereitung ,\n        ff:UnterstützteBeschäftigung ,\n        ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ,\n        ff:BeruflicheWeiterbildung\n      ) ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:predicate ff:eligibleWithinLast3Years ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n      sh:or [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:predicate ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n          ] ;\n        ] , [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:predicate ff:receivesBenefit ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_576842 ;\n          ] ;\n        ] , [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:predicate ff:receivesBenefit ;\n            sh:hasValue ff:UnemploymentBenefitsSVG ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      sh:condition [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:predicate ff:isVocationalReturnee ;\n            sh:hasValue false ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:predicate ff:isVocationalReturnee ;\n      sh:hasValue false ;\n      sh:or [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:predicate ff:participates ;\n            sh:in ff:School ;\n            sh:condition [\n                sh:property [\n                  sh:predicate ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                  sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ;\n              ] ;\n          ] ;\n        ] , [\n          sh:property [\n            sh:predicate ff:participates ;\n            sh:in ff:Berufsvorbereitung ;\n            sh:condition [\n                sh:property [\n                  sh:predicate ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n                  sh:hasValue true ;\n                ] ;\n              ] ;\n          ] ;\n        ] ;\n      ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' (Statutory Accident Insurance Pension). The target is the node \"ff:User\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. The main points are:\n\n1. The user must be legally accident insured.\n2. Their earning capacity must be reduced due to one or more insured events.\n3. The reduction must last beyond the 26th week after the event.\n4. The reduction must be at least 20%.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I need to use appropriate properties and classes. \n\nFor the first condition, I can use ff:hasInsurance with ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So, I'll create a shape for that.\n\nNext, the earning capacity reduction is covered by ff:hasEarningCapacity. The earning capacity node should have properties like ff:isPermanent set to true, ff:reductionInPercent >= 20, and ff:triggeringEvent linked to an insured event (which is a subclass of ff:Event, like ff:WorkAccident).\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL graph with the necessary constraints, ensuring each condition is properly linked and the values are correctly set. I'll also make sure to use the correct SHACL components and syntax.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:UserShape\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:equals ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n      sh:property [\n          sh:path ff:isPermanent ;\n          sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] , [\n          sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n          sh:minInclusive 20 ;\n        ] , [\n          sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n          sh:class ff:Event ;\n        ]\n    ] .\n```"

Gleichgestellt ist eine ganztägige Begleitung, das heißt, die Zeit Ihrer Anwesenheit im Krankenhaus beträgt zusammen mit Ihrer Anreise- und Abreisezeit mindestens 8 Stunden.\n  * Sie haben einen Verdienstausfall.\n  * Sie sind eine nahe angehörige Person oder Teil des engsten Umfelds.\n  * Die zu begleitende Person bezieht Leistungen der Eingliederungshilfe. Sie erhalten kein Krankengeld von der Krankenkasse, wenn Sie den Menschen mit Behinderung zum Beispiel als persönliche Assistenz begleiten und dafür ein Entgelt erhalten. Begleiten Sie den Menschen mit Behinderung im Rahmen der Eingliederungshilfe, werden die Kosten von den Trägern der Eingliederungshilfe übernommen.  \n\nSHACL:\n",
        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Krankengeld für Begleitperson bei stationärer Behandlung von Menschen mit Behinderung'. The target is the node \"ff:User\". \n\nFirst, I'll parse each requirement and see how it translates into SHACL constraints using the provided ontology.\n\n1. The user and the accompanied person with a disability are legally insured.\n   - So, both the user and the person they're accompanying must have legal health insurance. In the ontology, there's ff:hasInsurance which links to ff:Insurance. I'll need to check if the user and the accompanied person have this insurance.\n\n2. The accompanied person is being treated in the hospital.\n   - This implies that there's a medical event (ff:Event) where the person is hospitalized. I'll need to create a shape for the medical accompaniment event, ensuring it's an instance of ff:MedicalAccompaniment and that the user is accompanying someone.\n\n3. The inpatient accompaniment is medically necessary, and it's considered full-day if it's over 8 hours including travel.\n   - The ontology has ff:fullDayAccompaniment as a data property. I'll set this to true. Also, the event should be linked via ff:resultsInTreatment to an occupational rehabilitation.\n\n4. The user must have a loss of earnings.\n   - This translates to ff:hasEvent with a loss of earnings, so I'll use ff:causesLossOfEarnings set to true.\n\n5. The user must be a close relative or part of the immediate circle.\n   - I'll use ff:immediateCircleMember to link the user to the person they're accompanying.\n\n6. The accompanied person receives integration assistance and doesn't receive sickness benefit.\n   - I'll check that the person has ff:hasEvent of type ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea and that the user isn't receiving sickness benefit.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure each condition as a separate shape, ensuring each is properly linked and uses the correct properties from the ontology. I'll make sure to use only SHACL Core components and avoid any ambiguous requirements.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:targetClass ff:User ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n      sh:class ff:Insurance ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:inPatientCoAdmission ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:fullDayAccompaniment ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:resultsInTreatment ;\n      sh:class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:causesLossOfEarnings ;\n      sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:immediateCircleMember ;\n      sh:class ff:Person ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n      sh:class ff:EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n      sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_103817036 ;\n      sh:minCount 1 ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph based on the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente'. The target is always the node \"ff:User\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the text. The main points are:\n\n1. The user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner who died due to an insured event (work accident, commuting accident, or occupational disease).\n2. The user must have been in a legally valid marriage or civil partnership before the insured event.\n3. The user typically doesn't qualify if they married or entered the civil partnership after the insured event and the death occurred within the first year.\n\nI'll start by defining a shape for the user. The shape will have constraints that check for the existence of a deceased spouse or civil partner, the cause of death being an insured event, and the existence of a legal union before the event.\n\nFor the deceased partner, I'll use the properties ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner. These should point to a person node. The cause of death should be an event, so I'll use ff:causeOfDeath, and that event should be an instance of either WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease.\n\nNext, the legal union before the event is crucial. The property ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent links an event to a person, so I'll ensure the user was in such a union before the insured event.\n\nI also need to handle the exception where the marriage or partnership was after the event and the death was within the first year. Since SHACL can't express negations directly, I'll have to model the valid cases and assume the rest are invalid, but I'll note this limitation.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SHACL graph with the necessary property constraints and class-based restrictions to ensure all conditions are met.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:User\n  a sh:Shape ;\n  sh:property [\n      sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ;\n      sh:class ff:Person ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ;\n      sh:class ff:Person ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:causeOfDeath ;\n      sh:class [\n        sh:or (\n          ff:WorkAccident\n          ff:CommutingAccident\n          ff:OccupationalDisease\n        )\n      ] ;\n    ] , [\n      sh:path ff:legalUnionBeforeEvent ;\n      sh:class ff:Person ;\n    ] .\n```"
