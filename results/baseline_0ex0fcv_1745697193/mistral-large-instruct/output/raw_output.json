The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and enclose it within triple backticks, like this: ```turtle ...Turtle content... ```\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -

Ansprüche gegen Dritte – insbesondere\nUnterhaltsansprüche – sind grundsätzlich vorrangig zu verfolgen.

The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Text: The social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components. \n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    -
