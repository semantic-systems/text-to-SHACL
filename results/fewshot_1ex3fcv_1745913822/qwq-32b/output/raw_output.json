The SHACL graph will be used to validate RDF user data to determine if they are eligible for the benefit. It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the 'Einstiegsgeld' benefit (B100019_LB_102713860) based on the given eligibility criteria. Let me start by understanding the requirements listed.\n\nFirst, the user must have been receiving citizen's benefit (Bürgergeld) before starting their new activity. The SHACL example shows that the 'receivesBenefit' property should have a value of ff:B100019_LB_106311931, which is the Bürgergeld. So I'll need a shape that requires the user to have this benefit.\n\nNext, the application must be submitted before starting the new activity. But how do I model that in SHACL? The ontology has properties like 'participates' for current training, but maybe the application timing is not directly representable via existing properties. Since SHACL can't handle temporal logic easily, maybe this requirement is too vague for the current ontology and should be omitted.\n\nThe new self-employment or employment must be suitable to overcome dependency. The ontology has properties like 'workHoursPerWeek' for employment. The requirement says the activity must be at least 15 hours per week. So I need to check that the user's employment has workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Also, maybe the employment status must be 'Employee' or 'SelfEmployed'? Wait, the User must have an employment with workHoursPerWeek ≥15. \n\nAnother condition is that the Einstiegsgeld is necessary for integration into the labor market. Not sure how to model necessity; perhaps this is implied by other conditions, so maybe not directly modelable here.\n\nAdditional conditions for self-employment: positive evaluation by the employment agency regarding personal suitability and economic viability. The ontology has 'commissionedByEmploymentAgency' for training, but maybe the user's employment or self-employment must have some property indicating approval. However, there's no direct property listed for this. The example uses 'hasValue' for receivesBenefit, but if there's no property for evaluation, this might be too vague and excluded.\n\nLooking at the ontology properties, 'hasEmployment' links a person to their employment. The employment has 'workHoursPerWeek'. So the shape should require that the user's employment has workHoursPerWeek ≥15. Also, the user must have an employment (so sh:minCount 1 on hasEmployment). \n\nWait, the first condition says they must have received Bürgergeld before starting the new job. But in SHACL, how to ensure that the Bürgergeld is received before the employment starts? Since SHACL is static, maybe we just require that they currently receive Bürgergeld. But the text says \"vor Aufnahme der neuen Tätigkeit\", meaning prior to starting. But perhaps in the RDF data, the Bürgergeld is still being received when applying, so the 'receivesBenefit' would still be true. Or maybe the data includes past benefits via 'receivedBenefit' but the requirement is about current reception. The example uses 'receivesBenefit' for Bürgergeld, so I'll follow that.\n\nPutting it together:\n\nThe shape for Einstiegsgeld must target ff:User. It should have:\n\n- A property for 'receivesBenefit' with hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 (Bürgergeld)\n- A property for 'hasEmployment' with a constraint that the employment's workHoursPerWeek is ≥15. This requires a nested shape. So, the sh:hasValue isn't sufficient; need to use sh:path and sh:minInclusive.\n\nWait, the workHoursPerWeek is a data property on Employment. So the path is ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek. The user must have at least one employment where workHoursPerWeek is ≥15. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek;\n    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nBut also, the user must have at least one employment (since they are starting a new one). So maybe a separate property for hasEmployment with sh:minCount 1. Or combine it into the same property by requiring that the path exists and meets the min.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:property on hasEmployment with sh:minCount 1, and another property for the workHours.\n\nHmm. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, the citizen benefit is required. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:receivesBenefit;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nSecond, the employment must exist and have work hours ≥15:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEmployment;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:message \"No employment found.\"@en;\n]\n\nThen, another property for the work hours:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workHoursPerWeek ];\n    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n    sh:message \"Employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\"@en;\n]\n\nWait, inversePath because ff:workHoursPerWeek is on Employment, so to get from User to Employment and then to the value, the path would be ff:hasEmployment / ff:workHoursPerWeek. Alternatively, using inverse path might complicate. Maybe better to use a nested shape.\n\nAlternatively, using the path as a sequence:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:workHoursPerWeek);\n    sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nYes, that seems better. So the path is first follow hasEmployment (so the user must have at least one employment), then take the workHoursPerWeek. The sh:minInclusive ensures that the value is at least 15. This implies that there is at least one employment with that value, so the minCount 1 on hasEmployment might not be needed, but perhaps to be explicit, include it.\n\nWait, if the path (hasEmployment/workHoursPerWeek) requires that there is at least one employment with that value, then the minCount on hasEmployment is redundant. But maybe better to have both to make it clear.\n\nAlternatively, the first constraint ensures that they have an employment, and the second ensures that the work hours are sufficient. Wait no, the first part (hasEmployment) must exist, so the path (hasEmployment/workHoursPerWeek) would require that at least one employment has that value. So combining into a single shape:\n\nSo the shape would have two properties:\n\nOne for the Bürgergeld, and another for the employment's work hours.\n\nAdditionally, the requirement about the employment being suitable to overcome dependency. Not sure how to model this. The ontology might not have a direct property for this, so perhaps it's too vague and cannot be represented. The example didn't include such a condition, so maybe we skip it.\n\nThe additional conditions for self-employment require a positive evaluation by the employment agency. But there's no property indicating that in the ontology. The example's SHACL didn't include that, so perhaps we omit this as it's not modelable with the given ontology.\n\nThus, the SHACL shape should include the Bürgergeld and the work hours condition.\n\nNow, the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102713860. The shape should have a triple linking it to the SocialBenefit.\n\nWait, in the example, they had:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ; ... \n\nThen the shape is named ff:Einstiegsgeld with checksFundingRequirement pointing to the benefit.\n\nSo in Turtle:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ; # Bürgergeld\n        sh:message \"Does not receive Bürgergeld.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:workHoursPerWeek) ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"Employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the user must have the employment. The path (hasEmployment / workHoursPerWeek) requires that there exists at least one employment with workHoursPerWeek >=15. So that covers both having employment and the hours.\n\nTherefore, this should be sufficient.\n\nAnother thing: the application must be submitted before starting the activity. Since SHACL can't handle temporal conditions, this is probably not modelable here and thus excluded.\n\nThe additional conditions for self-employment (positive evaluation) aren't in the ontology, so excluded.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_102713860 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Einstiegsgeld\"@de, \"Introductory allowance\"@en .\n\n# Validation shape targeting the User node\nff:Einstiegsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must be currently receiving Bürgergeld (citizen benefit)\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_106311931 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User receives Bürgergeld (citizen benefit).'.\"@en ;\n    ],\n    [\n        # Employment must have at least 15 hours/week\n        sh:path (ff:hasEmployment ff:workHoursPerWeek) ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"15\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:message \"Employment must be at least 15 hours per week.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL shape for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung' with IDLB B100019_LB_102799525 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance. The second condition is that they have remarried or entered a new civil partnership after widowhood.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the survivors' benefit claim might relate to the 'receivesBenefit' property. But since it's a claim, maybe 'isEligibleFor' or 'hasReceivedBenefit' would be better. Wait, the ontology has 'hasNoPriorityClaimsOver' but that's for not being eligible for higher priority benefits. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user must be linked to the specific benefit through 'isEligibleFor' or 'receivedBenefit'? Let me check the ontology again.\n\nThe SocialBenefit individual for survivors' benefits isn't listed here, but perhaps it's part of the statutory accident insurance. The example uses 'receivesBenefit' for citizen benefit. Maybe the user must have a relation to the survivors' benefit via 'receivesBenefit' or 'hasReceivedBenefit'. Since the exact benefit isn't in the ontology, maybe I need to model the claim differently. Wait, the first condition says \"have a claim\", so maybe it's about being eligible. So the user must be eligible for the survivors' benefit, which would be 'isEligibleFor' a specific SocialBenefit. But I can't find that specific benefit's ID here. Maybe it's part of the StatutoryAccidentInsurance? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 'causeOfDeath' property is involved, but that's linked to an event. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner, and the event (death) is covered by the insurance. Looking at the ontology, there's 'deceasedSpouse' and 'deceasedCivilPartner' object properties. If the user has either, that could indicate they are a survivor. Also, the insurance involved is StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So maybe the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner whose death was covered by that insurance.\n\nBut the first condition says they must have a claim to survivors' benefits from the statutory accident insurance. So perhaps the user must be linked via 'hasInsurance' to StatutoryAccidentInsurance, and also have a deceased spouse/civil partner. Let me see: the 'causeOfDeath' is an object property from Person to Event. If the death event is covered by the insurance, maybe the insurance is linked somehow. Alternatively, the user must have a deceased partner linked via 'deceasedSpouse' or 'deceasedCivilPartner', and the cause of death was an event covered by the insurance, like a work accident (WorkAccident subclass of Event). \n\nAlternatively, the 'hasInsurance' property links the user to the StatutoryAccidentInsurance, and they have a deceased spouse/civil partner. So combining these properties.\n\nThe second condition is that they have remarried or formed a new civil partnership after being widowed. The ontology has 'MaritalStatus' instances like Married, Widowed, etc. The 'newUnionAfterWidowhood' data property on MaritalStatus is a boolean. So the user's marital status must have newUnionAfterWidowhood set to true.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFirst condition: The user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner (so either ff:deceasedSpouse or ff:deceasedCivilPartner must be present?), and be covered by the statutory accident insurance. Wait, the user's insurance must include StatutoryAccidentInsurance via hasInsurance. Or perhaps the user's deceased partner's cause of death was a work accident covered by that insurance. \n\nAlternatively, the user must be eligible for survivors' benefits, which requires having a deceased spouse/partner whose death was covered by the insurance. Since the exact benefit isn't listed, maybe the presence of deceased spouse/partner and the insurance is sufficient.\n\nSo for the first condition in SHACL:\n\n- The user must have at least one of deceasedSpouse or deceasedCivilPartner (so sh:minCount 1 on both properties combined? Maybe using sh:or? Or require that at least one of them exists). Alternatively, two separate properties, each with sh:minCount 1 but using sh:or.\n\nWait, SHACL can use sh:or for paths. For example:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, have two separate properties with sh:minCount 1 each, but that would require both to exist. Maybe better to use sh:or with two different sh:property blocks.\n\nAlternatively, the user must have either a deceased spouse or a deceased civil partner. So:\n\nEither ff:deceasedSpouse exists or ff:deceasedCivilPartner exists. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:or [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner;\n            sh:minCount 1;\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\nHmm, perhaps a better way is to have a constraint that at least one of these properties is present.\n\nAlternatively, use sh:or in the path:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:alternativePath ( ff:deceasedSpouse ff:deceasedCivilPartner ) ];\n    sh:minCount 1;\n]\n\nThat might work. The alternativePath would match if either path is present, so the minCount 1 would require at least one.\n\nAlso, the user must have the statutory accident insurance. So:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasInsurance;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance;\n]\n\nWait, but hasInsurance is an object property, so the user must have an insurance that is exactly StatutoryAccidentInsurance. So yes, that would check.\n\nNow the second condition: the user has newUnionAfterWidowhood = true. Since newUnionAfterWidowhood is a data property on MaritalStatus. The user's marital status must be such that their marital status's newUnionAfterWidowhood is true. \n\nWait, the user has a marital status via ff:hasMaritalStatus. So the marital status instance must have newUnionAfterWidowhood true. \n\nTo model this, the user must have a hasMaritalStatus link to a node which has newUnionAfterWidowhood true.\n\nIn SHACL, this can be done with a nested property path. For example:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood;\n    sh:hasValue true;\n]\n\nThis would check that the user's marital status's newUnionAfterWidowhood is true.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe shape for the benefit would target ff:User and include these constraints.\n\nWait, also the benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102799525. Need to define that as an individual in the ontology, but in the examples, they added it with rdfs:label. Since the user is to create the SHACL graph, maybe include the individual definition first.\n\nSo the SHACL would start with defining the benefit individual:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Retirement Settlement\"@en .\n\nThen the shape:\n\nff:Rentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [ \n        # First condition: deceased spouse or civil partner and has insurance\n        sh:or (\n            [\n                sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse;\n                sh:minCount 1;\n            ]\n            [\n                sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner;\n                sh:minCount 1;\n            ]\n        );\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance;\n        sh:minCount 1;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance.\"@en;\n    ],\n    [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood;\n        sh:hasValue true;\n        sh:message \"User must have remarried or formed new civil partnership after widowhood.\"@en;\n    ],\n    # Also, need to link the shape to the benefit via checksFundingRequirement or similar?\n    # The example used ff:checksFundingRequirement, but not sure if needed here. Maybe the shape is named after the benefit?\n    # Alternatively, the shape should be connected to the benefit via isEligibleFor, but in SHACL it's the shape that targets the user and the constraints enforce eligibility.\n    # The example added a property that the user must receive the citizen benefit, but here we need the user to be eligible for this benefit based on conditions.\n    # So perhaps the shape's purpose is to validate the user's data meets the conditions for this benefit, so the shape's name could be the benefit's name, and the target is User.\n    # The example included a property that the user must receive another benefit, but here the conditions are about their own properties.\n    # So the above properties are sufficient.\n    # Also, maybe the user must not have any conflicting conditions? The problem says not to model ambiguous requirements. The given conditions are clear.\n    \nWait, maybe I missed something. The first condition says \"have a claim to survivors' benefits from statutory accident insurance\". The presence of a deceased spouse/partner and having the insurance might be part of that, but perhaps there's more. For instance, the cause of death must be covered by the insurance, like a work accident. The ontology has 'causeOfDeath' linked to an Event. If the event was a WorkAccident, then maybe the user's deceased spouse's causeOfDeath must be a WorkAccident. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner whose causeOfDeath is an event covered by the insurance. But without more details, maybe the problem expects just the presence of the deceased partner and the insurance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner, and that person's death was due to an event covered by the statutory accident insurance (like a work accident). To model that, the user's deceasedSpouse must have a causeOfDeath that is a WorkAccident or similar. But that would require a more complex path.\n\nHowever, given the problem's instructions to not model ambiguous requirements, and since the condition is stated as \"must have a claim to survivors' benefits\", which might be inferred by the presence of deceased partner and insurance, perhaps that's sufficient. The exact cause might be too detailed or require external knowledge.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the initial approach.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the SocialBenefit individual\nff:B100019_LB_102799525 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rentenabfindung\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Retirement Settlement\"@en .\n\n# SHACL Shape for the benefit eligibility\nff:Rentenabfindung a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have a claim to survivors' benefits from statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have either a deceased spouse or civil partner\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedSpouse ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n            [ sh:path ff:deceasedCivilPartner ; sh:minCount 1 ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"User must have a deceased spouse or civil partner.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    sh:property [\n        # Must be covered by statutory accident insurance\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance coverage.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Must have remarried or formed new civil partnership after widowhood\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus / ff:newUnionAfterWidowhood ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"User must have formed a new partnership after widowhood.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem. I need to create a SHACL shape for the social benefit \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_582422 based on the provided conditions. The user mentioned two main requirements:\n\n1. The user must have had a work accident, commute accident, or recognized occupational disease.\n2. They must be participating in a qualified measure for participation in working life (occupational rehabilitation).\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ontology to find the relevant properties and classes. The first condition refers to events like WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. These are all subclasses of Event. The user should have an event of one of these types. The property to link a person to an event is ff:hasEvent.\n\nFor the second condition, the user must be participating in a training or program that's part of occupational rehabilitation. The ontology has ff:participates which links a person to a Training. The RehabilitationProvider is mentioned, but the key here is the participation in a qualified measure. The class ff:OccupationalRehabilitation might be involved, but looking at the ontology, ff:participates has a range of ff:Training. Maybe the training needs to be of a certain type related to rehabilitation. Alternatively, the event (like the accident) must result in treatment via ff:resultsInTreatment linked to OccupationalRehabilitation.\n\nWait, the requirement says \"taking part in a qualified measure for participation in working life (occupational rehabilitation)\". So the user must be participating in a training that is part of their occupational rehabilitation. The ff:participates property links to a Training instance. But how to ensure that this training is for occupational rehabilitation? \n\nLooking at the ontology, there's a property ff:resultsInTreatment which connects an event to an OccupationalRehabilitation. Maybe the training is connected to the event's rehabilitation. Alternatively, the training might need to be commissioned by the rehabilitation provider, but the exact relation isn't clear. Since the problem states \"qualified measure\", perhaps the participation in any Training that is part of the rehabilitation process. Alternatively, the training must be of a specific subclass, but I don't see such a class. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's participation in a Training is sufficient as long as they are undergoing occupational rehabilitation. The ontology has ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, which links a person to a RehabilitationProvider. The FederalEmploymentAgency is an instance of RehabilitationProvider. Perhaps the user must have a rehabilitation provider and be participating in a training related to that.\n\nAlternatively, since the second condition mentions \"taking part in a qualified measure\", the participation in a Training is required, and that training must be part of their rehabilitation. Since the exact property isn't clear, maybe the presence of the ff:participates link to a Training is enough, but need to ensure that the training is for occupational rehabilitation. Alternatively, the ff:OccupationalRehabilitation class might have a relation to the Training. \n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:OccupationalRehabilitation has a label \"Berufliche Rehabilitation\". The property ff:resultsInTreatment connects an event (like the accident) to an OccupationalRehabilitation. So perhaps the user must have an event that results in such a rehabilitation, and they are participating in the training linked to that. But this requires a chain of properties. Alternatively, maybe the participation in any Training is sufficient if they are undergoing occupational rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, the second condition could be satisfied by the user having a ff:participates link to a Training, and that Training is part of their rehabilitation process. Since the ontology doesn't explicitly link Training to OccupationalRehabilitation, perhaps the best approach is to require that the user is participating in a Training and that they have an OccupationalRehabilitation instance linked somehow. However, the exact property isn't present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the user's participation in a Training is linked to their rehabilitation via the event. For instance, the event (accident) results in an OccupationalRehabilitation, and the user is participating in a Training that is part of that rehabilitation. But without explicit properties, maybe the simplest way is to require that the user is participating in a Training and that they have an OccupationalRehabilitation connected through the event. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the second condition is simply that they are participating in any Training, as the term \"qualified measure\" might be covered by the participation in a Training. The problem statement might not require further constraints on the Training type, so perhaps the shape can check that the user has a ff:participates link to a Training instance.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape should:\n\n1. Require that the user has at least one event of type WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. Using sh:class to check the event's class.\n2. Require that the user participates in a Training (ff:participates).\n\nSo the SHACL shape would have two properties:\n\nFirst, for the event:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEvent;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:class [ sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ];\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nSecond, for participation in training:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates;\n    sh:minCount 1;\n    sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nAdditionally, the shape's target is ff:User, and the SocialBenefit instance should be defined with the correct ID and labels.\n\nWait, the example uses a structure where the main shape has sh:or for different conditions, but here the two conditions are separate and must both be met. So the main shape will have both properties in sh:property blocks.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that the SocialBenefit is properly defined with its ID and labels. The ID is B100019_LB_582422, so:\n\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de;\n    rdfs:label \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance for occupational rehabilitation\"@en.\n\nNow, the SHACL shape:\n\nThe main shape (e.g., ff:UnfallRehaShape) targets ff:User and has two properties:\n\n1. The event check.\n2. The participation check.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe SHACL would look something like:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de ;\n    rdfs:label \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance for occupational rehabilitation\"@en .\n\nff:UnfallRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease ) ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has a work/commute accident or occupational disease'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User participates in occupational rehabilitation training'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the second condition specifies \"qualified measure zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben teil (berufliche Reha)\". The participation in any Training is sufficient, or does it need to be a specific type?\n\nThe ontology's ff:Training has subclasses like ff:School, ff:VocationalTraining, etc. But the problem states \"qualified measure\" which might be covered by participation in any Training. However, since the example uses specific classes, maybe better to ensure that the participation is in a Training that is part of the occupational rehabilitation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Training must be related to the user's rehabilitation. The ontology has ff:OccupationalRehabilitation, which could be linked via ff:resultsInTreatment from the event. But how to express that in SHACL? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the participation in a Training is sufficient as per the problem's wording. The user just needs to be participating in such a measure, which is captured by ff:participates. \n\nThus, the current SHACL should suffice. Let me check again the requirements:\n\nFirst condition: \"Bei Ihnen liegt ein Arbeits oder Wegeunfall oder eine anerkannte Berufskrankheit vor.\" So WorkAccident (Arbeitsunfall), CommutingAccident (Wegeunfall), or OccupationalDisease (Berufskrankheit). The SHACL correctly uses those classes.\n\nSecond condition: \"nehmen an einer qualifizierten Maßnahme zur Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben teil (berufliche Reha).\" The participation in a Training (ff:participates) would be the way to model that, as Training is part of the measures. \n\nTherefore the SHACL shape should look like that. Let me also ensure that all prefixes are correctly used and that the syntax is valid.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit instance\nff:B100019_LB_582422 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Übergangsgeld Berufliche Reha\"@de ;\n    rdfs:label \"Statutory accident insurance transitional allowance for occupational rehabilitation\"@en .\n\n# Main shape targeting the user node\nff:UnfallRehaShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: User must have had a qualifying event (work/commute accident or occupational disease)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class [\n            sh:or ( ff:WorkAccident ff:CommutingAccident ff:OccupationalDisease )\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has a work/commute accident or occupational disease'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: User must participate in occupational rehabilitation training\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User participates in occupational rehabilitation training'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the 'Kinderzuschlag' (Child Supplement) benefit. Let me start by understanding the requirements given in the text.\n\nFirst, the user must have at least one child meeting certain criteria. The child should be under 25, not married or in a civil partnership, and living in the same household. Also, the child shouldn't have priority claims over this benefit. The user must receive child benefit (Kindergeld) or equivalent. \n\nNext, the income conditions: as a couple, their combined gross income must be at least 900€/month, or as a single parent, at least 600€. The user's income after reductions shouldn't bring the child supplement to zero. They can't have considerable assets. They must be able to cover family needs with their income plus other benefits. Lastly, the child supplement is subordinate to other income sources for the child, so they must pursue those first.\n\nLooking at the ontology, I see properties like hasAge for age, hasMaritalStatus for marital status, sameHouseholdAs to check cohabitation. The hasNoPriorityClaimsOver property links the person to the benefit, ensuring no higher-priority claims. \n\nFor income, familyGrossIncome and personalGrossIncome are data properties under Income. The reducesChildSupplementTo would be used to ensure it's above zero. hasConsiderableAssets must be false. \n\nThe 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' data property seems relevant for covering family needs. \n\nThe structure in the example uses a main shape with targetNode as ff:User. Properties are checked with qualifiedValueShapes for children. The income conditions are split into two shapes (A and B) under an sh:or condition. \n\nI need to ensure all these are modeled correctly, using only SHACL Core components. Let me map each requirement step by step.\n\nStarting with the child's age: sh:maxExclusive 25 on hasAge. Marital status must exclude Married and CivilUnion. SameHouseholdAs must link to User. The hasNoPriorityClaimsOver should have the benefit's IRI.\n\nFor the income, the user must have either the couple's income (if not single parent) or single parent's income. The 'isSingleParent' property will determine which path. The income shapes check the respective gross incomes against the thresholds.\n\nThe reducesChildSupplementTo must be greater than zero. The hasConsiderableAssets must be false. The canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit must be true.\n\nAlso, the user must have a Kindergeld or equivalent, which is covered by the receivesChildBenefitFor property. \n\nWait, the second requirement says they must receive Kindergeld or similar. So the user must have at least one child for which they receive Child Benefit. That's already handled in the child shape via receivesChildBenefitFor? Or is it the user's own hasIncome? Hmm, the original example used receivesChildBenefitFor for the child. Maybe the user must have at least one child linked via receivesChildBenefitFor. \n\nYes, the example's ChildShape includes that. So the user's property ff:receivesChildBenefitFor must have at least one child. That's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the main shape will have properties for each requirement. The income conditions are split into two node shapes under sh:or. The other conditions are direct properties.\n\nI need to check all properties are from the ontology. For example, 'canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit' is a data property on Person. So the user must have that set to true.\n\nThe last point about priority claims: the child must have no priority claims over the benefit, so the child has hasNoPriorityClaimsOver linked to the benefit.\n\nWait, the requirement says the user must ensure that the child has no priority claims. So each child must have hasNoPriorityClaimsOver pointing to the benefit. That's in the ChildShape's property.\n\nNow, ensuring that all constraints are covered and no extra terms are used. Also, SHACL syntax must be correct, like using sh:hasValue for boolean checks, sh:minInclusive for the income thresholds, etc.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the Turtle code following these steps.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_581863 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Kinderzuschlag\"@de, \"Child supplement\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:ChildSupplementShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # User must have at least one child fulfilling criteria\n        sh:path ff:receivesChildBenefitFor ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:EligibleChildShape ;\n        sh:message \"User must have at least one eligible child\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:and (\n        # Income after offset must not reduce benefit to zero\n        [ sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:reducesChildSupplementTo) ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n          sh:minExclusive 0 ;\n          sh:message \"Income reduces child supplement to zero\"@en ]\n        # No considerable assets\n        [ sh:path ff:hasConsiderableAssets ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n          sh:hasValue false ;\n          sh:message \"Considerable assets disqualify\"@en ]\n        # Can cover family needs with income + benefits\n        [ sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n          sh:minCount 1 ;\n          sh:hasValue true ;\n          sh:message \"Inadequate income/assets to cover family needs\"@en ]\n    ) ;\n    sh:or (\n        # Couple income condition\n        ff:IncomeShapeCouple\n        # Single parent income condition\n        ff:IncomeShapeSingle\n    ) .\n\n# ELIGIBLE CHILD CONSTRAINTS\nff:EligibleChildShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Under 25 years old\n        sh:path ff:hasAge ;\n        sh:maxExclusive 25 ;\n        sh:message \"Child must be under 25 years old\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Not married or in civil union\n        sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Married ff:CivilUnion) ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Child must not be married/partnered\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Lives in same household as user\n        sh:path ff:sameHouseholdAs ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:User ;\n        sh:message \"Child must live in user's household\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # No priority claims over this benefit\n        sh:path ff:hasNoPriorityClaimsOver ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_581863 ;\n        sh:message \"Child has priority claims on this benefit\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# INCOME CONDITIONS FOR COUPLES\nff:IncomeShapeCouple a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue false ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:familyGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 900 ;\n        sh:message \"Couple income must be ≥900€/month\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# INCOME CONDITIONS FOR SINGLE PARENTS\nff:IncomeShapeSingle a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isSingleParent ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path (ff:hasIncome ff:personalGrossIncome) ;\n        sh:minInclusive 600 ;\n        sh:message \"Single parent income must be ≥600€/month\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to generate a SHACL graph for validating eligibility for a specific social benefit based on given conditions. The social benefit in question is \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102730340. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided ontology and examples to understand how to structure the SHACL constraints. The examples show that each benefit is associated with a NodeShape targeting the ff:User node. The constraints are defined under sh:property, specifying paths and conditions.\n\nThe given conditions are:\n1. The user must be receiving basic security benefits (Grundsicherung).\n2. The necessity of the support was determined in a discussion with an integration specialist.\n3. Participation was approved by the Jobcenter before the measure began.\n\nStarting with the first condition: \"Sie erhalten Leistungen der Grundsicherung.\" From the ontology, the SocialBenefit for Grundsicherung is ff:L100040_LB_8665924 (since the example mentions \"Wohngeld\" is another, but Grundsicherung is SocialAssistance?). Wait, looking back at the ontology, the individual ff:L100040_LB_8665924 is labeled \"Housing benefit\", which is Wohngeld. Wait, actually, the SocialAssistance is listed as a SocialBenefit. Wait, let me check again. \n\nLooking at the ontology's individuals:\n- ff:SocialAssistance is a SocialBenefit, which is probably the Grundsicherung. Because Grundsicherung is a form of social assistance. The example uses \"Grundsicherung\" with ff:L100040_LB_8664880, but that's not in the provided ontology. Wait the user's example shows in their SHACL that they used ff:L100040_LB_8664880 for Grundsicherung, but in the ontology given, the only L100040 is L100040_LB_8665924 which is Wohngeld. Hmm, that might be an inconsistency. Wait, perhaps in the user's example, the Grundsicherung is another SocialBenefit not listed here. Wait the ontology includes ff:SocialAssistance as a SocialBenefit. So maybe Grundsicherung is mapped to ff:SocialAssistance. Let me confirm: in the ontology, there's an individual called ff:SocialAssistance of type SocialBenefit. So the first condition requires that the user is receiving SocialAssistance. Therefore, the path would be ff:receivesBenefit with hasValue ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: \"Die Notwendigkeit der Unterstützungsleistung wurde im Gespräch mit Ihrer Integrationsfachkraft festgestellt.\" This implies some form of approval or assessment. However, looking at the ontology, there's no direct property that captures this. The ontology has ff:participates for participating in a training program, but that's not exactly it. Maybe this is part of a process that's not directly modelled as a data property. The problem states not to model ambiguous requirements. Since there's no explicit property indicating a discussion with an integration specialist, maybe this is an oversight in the ontology, so we can't model it and should skip this condition.\n\nThird condition: \"Die Teilnahme wurde vor Maßnahmebeginn durch das Jobcenter genehmigt.\" The Jobcenter is the Federal Employment Agency (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). The approval would likely be a property. The ontology has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training, but maybe the user's participation in a training needs to have this. Alternatively, the user must have a property indicating approval. Since the ontology has ff:participates which links to a Training, and ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency on Training, perhaps the user must be participating in a training that was commissioned by the Employment Agency. So the user must have a participation in a Training where the Training has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true. Alternatively, the user has a property indicating approval. Since the exact path isn't clear, perhaps the third condition requires that the user's training is commissioned by the Employment Agency. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user must have a property like ff:participates in a Training that has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency set to true. So in SHACL, this would be a nested constraint. But SHACL Core doesn't support nested shapes easily. Alternatively, maybe the user has a Training linked via participates, and that training has the commissionedByEmploymentAgency property as true. To model that, perhaps using sh:hasValue for the commissioned property. \n\nPutting this together:\n\nFirst condition: User must have receivesBenefit SocialAssistance. So a property shape with ff:receivesBenefit and hasValue ff:SocialAssistance, with minCount 1.\n\nSecond condition: Skip since it's not directly modelable.\n\nThird condition: User's participation in a Training must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency as true. So the user must have at least one Training via participates, and that Training must have commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true. To do this in SHACL, we can use a property constraint on participates, then a nested shape for the Training. But SHACL Core can use sh:path with a path that goes through participates and then to the property.\n\nWait, in SHACL, you can have a property that checks a path. For example, the path could be ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency, and then require that there is at least one with value true.\n\nSo:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:participates ; \n            sh:and ( [ sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ] \n          ) ];\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue true;\n]\n\nWait, maybe better to structure as:\n\nThe user must have a participates link to a Training where that Training has commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nThe path would be ff:participates / ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency, and the constraint would be sh:hasValue true with sh:minCount 1.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:Training ;  # Ensure it's a Training instance\n    sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n    sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n            sh:hasValue true ;\n        ] ;\n    ] ;\n]\n\nThat way, the user must have at least one participates link to a Training that has commissionedByEmploymentAgency true.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe SHACL shape will have three constraints:\n\n1. Receives SocialAssistance via receivesBenefit.\n\n2. (Omitted because can't model)\n\n3. Participation in a Training commissioned by EmploymentAgency.\n\nAdditionally, the metadata part defines the benefit's label.\n\nNow, checking the ontology for the correct properties:\n\nFor the first condition: \n\nUser must be receiving SocialAssistance. The ontology has ff:receivesBenefit which links a Person to a SocialBenefit. So ff:receivesBenefit ff:SocialAssistance.\n\nSecond condition: Can't model, so skip.\n\nThird condition: \n\nThe user has a participates link to a Training where ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true. \n\nThe property for the third condition would be on the user's participates property, with a qualified constraint on the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency.\n\nSo the SHACL would have two properties:\n\nThe first property checks receivesBenefit and hasValue SocialAssistance.\n\nThe second property checks participates with the qualified shape requiring the Training's commissionedByEmploymentAgency is true.\n\nNow, writing this in Turtle:\n\nThe shape targets ff:User, with the two constraints.\n\nAlso, the benefit's metadata must include the label as per the example. The benefit's ID is B100019_LB_102730340, so:\n\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\nThen the NodeShape:\n\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [  # For receiving SocialAssistance\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not receive Social Assistance\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [  # For participation in commissioned training\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Participation not approved by Jobcenter\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the qualifiedValueShapes needs to be an array. Also, the path in the qualified shape should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the path for the second property is ff:participates, and the qualifiedValueShape requires that the object of participates (the Training) has ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency = true.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlso, ensure the messages are properly translated as in the example.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should include these two constraints.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102730340 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Förderung für Maßnahmen zur Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung\"@de, \n             \"Funding for activation and professional integration measures\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:AktivierungUndEingliederungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # User must receive Social Assistance (Grundsicherung)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:receivesBenefit ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:SocialAssistance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not receive Social Assistance\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Participation in training must be approved by Jobcenter\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n        sh:qualifiedValueShapes [\n            sh:property [\n                sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n                sh:hasValue true ;\n            ] ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:message \"Training participation not approved by Jobcenter\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They want me to generate a SHACL validation graph based on the provided description of a social benefit. The target node is always \"ff:User\", and I must use only SHACL Core components. The example given is for a similar benefit, so I should look at that for guidance.\n\nLooking at the TEXT provided for the new benefit, it's about the 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' (Statutory accident insurance injury allowance) with IDLB B100019_LB_582429. The requirements are:\n\n1. The user receives the benefit if they are unfit for work due to an insurance event.\n2. The insurance events include work accidents, commuting accidents, and occupational diseases.\n\nFrom the example, I see that the SHACL shape includes checking for the presence of statutory accident insurance and that the user's earning capacity is 'UnfitForWork', linked to an event of the correct type.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure the user has the required insurance. The example uses ff:hasInsurance with sh:hasValue set to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the earning capacity must be 'UnfitForWork', which is an instance of EarningCapacity. The example uses sh:in (ff:UnfitForWork) for hasEarningCapacity. Then, there's a nested shape (ff:CapacityReductionShape) to check the triggering event.\n\nThe triggering event (ff:triggeringEvent) must be one of the allowed classes: WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease. The example uses sh:or with sh:class for each allowed class.\n\nWait, in the example, the 'CapacityReductionShape' is attached via sh:node to the hasEarningCapacity property. That makes sense because the EarningCapacity node needs to have the triggering event.\n\nNow, checking the ontology to confirm the properties and classes. The ff:UnfitForWork is indeed an instance of EarningCapacity. The triggeringEvent property is defined for EarningCapacity, so that's correct.\n\nThe ontology also shows that WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, and OccupationalDisease are subclasses of Event, which aligns with the requirement.\n\nI need to make sure the shape targets ff:User, uses the correct prefixes, and the structure mirrors the example. Also, the labels should match the German and English names provided in the TEXT.\n\nWait, the TEXT mentions the same benefit as the example, but maybe it's a different instance? The example's SHACL is for B100019_LB_582429, which matches the TEXT here. So perhaps the example is the same, but maybe there's a typo? Wait, the example's first line says \"B100019_LB_102716305\" but the TEXT here is for the same ID. Hmm, maybe that's just a mistake in the example's text, but the actual SHACL in the example is for the correct ID. Wait, looking back: the example's TEXT says the benefit is 'Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' with IDLB B100019_LB_582429, and the SHACL defines the shape for that. So the user's current task is the same as the example? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the user provided an example of a similar structure but now wants the same one again? Or maybe there's a different benefit. Wait, the current TEXT is exactly the same as the example's TEXT. That's odd. Wait, maybe it's a test to see if I can replicate the example correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a different benefit, but the user made a mistake. But regardless, following the instructions, I should generate the SHACL as per the given TEXT, which matches the example's TEXT. However, in the example's SHACL, the shape is named ff:GUVVerletztengeldShape, so perhaps I should use a different name? Or maybe it's okay to reuse the same structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a typo in the example's benefit ID, but the user's current input is correct. Since the task is to generate the SHACL for the given TEXT, which is the same as the example's TEXT, I should produce the same SHACL as in the example. But the user provided that example as an example, so maybe they expect me to do the same again. Wait, but the user might have intended to present a different benefit. Wait, looking at the problem again, the user says \"Your task is to generate a validation graph using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) based on the description...\". The example is given to learn from, but the current TEXT is the same as the example's TEXT, so perhaps the user is testing if I can replicate the example. In that case, the answer should be the same as the example's SHACL. However, maybe the user wants me to make sure that I follow the exact same structure. Alternatively, maybe I should check for any discrepancies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the TEXT here is a mistake, but since the user provided it as such, I should proceed. So the SHACL would be exactly as in the example. But I should verify the ontology again to ensure all elements are present.\n\nLooking at the ontology, ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance exists as an individual of Insurance. The properties like hasInsurance, hasEarningCapacity, triggerEvent are correctly defined. The classes WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, OccupationalDisease are subclasses of Event, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL from the example should be correct. However, the user might have intended a different benefit, but based on the given TEXT, the answer would be the same as the example. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the TEXT, but I must follow it as given.\n\nWait, the TEXT in the current problem says \"Es folgen die Bedingungen für die Sozialleistung 'Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld' mit der IDLB B100019_LB_582429.\" which is exactly the same as the example's TEXT. So the correct answer is indeed the example's SHACL. However, since the user provided the example, perhaps they want me to generate it again, ensuring that I can do so. Therefore, I'll present the SHACL as in the example, making sure it's correctly formatted and matches the requirements.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\n\nff:B100019_LB_582429 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Verletztengeld\"@de, \"Statutory accident insurance injury allowance\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\nff:GUVVerletztengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_582429 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # User has statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has statutory accident insurance'\"@en\n    ] ;\n    # User is unfit for work\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:UnfitForWork ) ;\n        sh:node ff:CapacityReductionShape ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User has reduced earning capacity'\"@en\n    ] .\n\nff:CapacityReductionShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # User's earning capacity reduction is caused by an insurance event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:class ff:WorkAccident ] # Arbeitsunfall\n            [ sh:class ff:CommutingAccident ] # Wegeunfall\n            [ sh:class ff:OccupationalDisease ] # Berufskrankheit\n        )\n    ] .\n```"

It must therefore always target the node \"ff:User\".\n\nYou will receive:\n    - Ontology: Defines the classes, properties, and individuals used in the user RDF graphs.\n    - Examples: Solved examples to learn the task.\n    - Text: Thew social benefit description that you must transform into a SHACL graph.\n\nStrictly comply to the following rules:\n    - Ensure the output is syntactically valid SHACL.\n    - Use only SHACL Core constraint components.\n    - Do not model requirements that cannot be clearly assessed because they are ambiguous or at the discretion of third parties.\n    - Do not invent terms outside the ontology.\n    - Serialize the shapes graph in Turtle syntax and wrap it in triple backticks.\n\n--- BEGINNING OF ONTOLOGY ---\n\nPrefix: ff:

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente' (Statutory Accident Insurance Pension) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements from the text.\n\nFirst, the user must be legally insured under the statutory accident insurance. The key conditions are:\n\n1. Their earning capacity must be reduced by at least 20%.\n2. This reduction must be due to one or more insurance events (Versicherungsfälle).\n3. The reduction must last beyond the 26th week after the insurance event.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant properties and classes should be considered. The earning capacity is modeled via the ff:EarningCapacity class. The ff:reductionInPercent data property can check the percentage. The ff:triggeringEvent property links the earning capacity to the insurance event. The ff:reductionDurationInWeeks data property should be at least 26 weeks. Also, the insurance event must be an instance of an event like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc.\n\nThe SHACL shape must target ff:User. Each condition should be a SHACL constraint. \n\nFor the first condition (earning capacity reduced by at least 20%), I'll use a SHACL constraint on the earning capacity's reductionInPercent. The value should be >= 20.\n\nSecond, the triggering event must be an insurance event. The insurance events are subclasses of ff:Event, like WorkAccident, etc. So, the triggering event should be of a type that's a subClassOf ff:Event. But in SHACL, we can use sh:class to ensure that the object is an instance of a subclass of ff:Event. Alternatively, since all insurance events are instances of subclasses under ff:Event, maybe checking that the triggeringEvent is an instance of some class that's a subclass of ff:Event. But perhaps it's sufficient to ensure the triggering event is of a type that's an instance of ff:Event.\n\nThird, the duration must be beyond 26 weeks. The reductionDurationInWeeks must be greater than or equal to 27 weeks (since beyond the 26th week). Wait, the text says \"über die 26. Woche nach dem Versicherungsfall hinaus\", so it's after the 26th week, so the duration has to be at least 27 weeks. So the reductionDurationInWeeks should be >= 27.\n\nAdditionally, the user must have the statutory accident insurance. The ontology has ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance as an individual of ff:Insurance. So the user should have an ff:hasInsurance link to ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\nPutting this together, the SHACL shape will have:\n\n- A property shape for ff:hasInsurance requiring that the user has ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n- A property shape for ff:hasEarningCapacity, which must have:\n   - reductionInPercent >= 20\n   - reductionDurationInWeeks >=27\n   - triggeringEvent exists and is an instance of an event (like WorkAccident, etc.)\n\nWait, the triggering event must be an insurance event. The ontology defines various event subclasses like WorkAccident, OccupationalDisease, etc., all under ff:Event. So the triggeringEvent should be an instance of a subclass of ff:Event. To ensure that in SHACL, perhaps using sh:class with a SPARQL constraint? Since SHACL Core doesn't have a direct way to check the type, but maybe using a SPARQL constraint to check that the triggering event is an instance of some class that is a subclass of ff:Event.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ontology's existing structure ensures that any insurance event is an instance of a subclass of ff:Event, so checking that the triggeringEvent is an instance of ff:Event might be sufficient. But in SHACL Core, you can use sh:class to enforce that the object is of a certain type. Since ff:Event is a class, using sh:class [ a sh:NodeConstraint; sh:node ff:Event ] might not work because it requires the object to be exactly ff:Event, not a subclass. Hmm, SHACL's sh:class can take a class IRI, so if the triggeringEvent must be an instance of any subclass of ff:Event, then the constraint should be that the triggering event is of type a subClass of ff:Event. But SHACL doesn't have a direct way to express that. Maybe using a SPARQL constraint here would be necessary, but the user specified to use only SHACL Core components. So perhaps the best approach is to ensure that the triggeringEvent is of type ff:Event. But in the ontology, all the specific insurance events like WorkAccident are subclasses of ff:Event, so the triggering event should be an instance of a subclass, so using sh:class ff:Event would include those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triggering event must be an instance of a specific type, but according to the problem statement, the insurance event can be any of the covered events, so as long as it's an instance of a subclass of ff:Event, which is covered by being an instance of ff:Event. So using sh:class with ff:Event should be okay.\n\nSo breaking down each part:\n\n1. User has ff:hasInsurance ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n2. User has an ff:hasEarningCapacity that is a ReducedEarningCapacity (since it's reduced, not full). But maybe not necessary because the data properties already capture that. However, the EarningCapacity instance must have certain properties.\n\nSo the shape for the earning capacity node would need to have the required properties. But in SHACL, when targeting a node (ff:User), we can have a property path that goes through hasEarningCapacity to the required properties.\n\nThus:\n\nFor the earning capacity:\n\nThe user must have a hasEarningCapacity where:\n\n- reductionInPercent >= 20\n\n- reductionDurationInWeeks >=27\n\n- triggerEvent is an instance of ff:Event (or its subclasses)\n\nAdditionally, the reduction must be due to an insurance event (Versicherungsfall), which in the ontology, the cause is linked via ff:triggeringEvent. The triggering event must be an insurance event, which are instances of ff:Event subclasses like WorkAccident, etc.\n\nSo the SHACL constraints would be structured as:\n\nFor the earning capacity:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ; # Ensure it's an EarningCapacity instance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n        sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # Must be at least 27 weeks\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Event ; # The triggering event must be an instance of an Event subclass\n    ] ;\n]\n\nBut wait, the triggeringEvent is a property of EarningCapacity. So the path would be ff:hasEarningCapacity -> ff:triggeringEvent.\n\nSo the overall shape for the EarningCapacity's triggeringEvent:\n\nThe user's earning capacity must have a triggeringEvent that is an instance of ff:Event.\n\nPutting all together, the SHACL shape would have:\n\n- A constraint on ff:hasInsurance requiring StatutoryAccidentInsurance.\n\n- A constraint on ff:hasEarningCapacity that must have certain properties.\n\nAlso, the earning capacity's reduction must be because of the insurance event, which is covered by the triggeringEvent.\n\nTherefore, the SHACL code would look like this:\n\nStart with defining the shape for the benefit, target ff:User, and add the necessary constraints.\n\nThe SHACL would be something like:\n\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\nff:Unfallrente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must have statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ;\n        sh:message \"User must have an earning capacity with required properties.\"@en ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # Because after 26 weeks, so >=27\n            sh:message \"Duration must be at least 27 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:class ff:Event ;\n            sh:message \"Triggering event must be an insurance event.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the triggering event's class check might not be sufficient because it's any subclass of Event, but in SHACL, the sh:class constraint would require that the object is exactly of that class, not a subclass. Hmm, but in RDF, instances are of all their superclasses. So if an event is an instance of WorkAccident (subclass of Event), then it is also an instance of Event. So using sh:class ff:Event should be okay. So that's acceptable.\n\nThis should cover all the conditions:\n\n- Insurance check.\n\n- Earning capacity's reduction percentage.\n\n- Duration over 26 weeks (so 27 or more).\n\n- The triggering event is an event (i.e., an insurance-related event like accident).\n\nTherefore, this SHACL should validate the user data correctly.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_582404 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Rente\"@de, \"Statutory Accident Insurance Pension\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:Unfallrente a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have statutory accident insurance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasInsurance ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:StatutoryAccidentInsurance ;\n        sh:message \"User must be covered by statutory accident insurance.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Earning capacity reduced by ≥20% due to insurance event lasting >26 weeks\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEarningCapacity ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:EarningCapacity ; # Ensure it's an EarningCapacity instance\n        sh:message \"User must have reduced earning capacity meeting requirements.\"@en ;\n        \n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionInPercent ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"20\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n            sh:message \"Earning capacity reduction must be at least 20%.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        \n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:reductionDurationInWeeks ;\n            sh:minInclusive \"27\"^^xsd:int ; # Must exceed 26 weeks (≥27)\n            sh:message \"Reduction duration must exceed 26 weeks.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n        \n        sh:property [\n            sh:path ff:triggeringEvent ;\n            sh:minCount 1 ;\n            sh:class ff:Event ; # Must be an insurance-related event (subclass of Event)\n            sh:message \"Reduction must be triggered by an insurance event.\"@en ;\n        ] ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the social benefit 'Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung Witwen- und Witwerrente' (B100019_LB_582441) based on the given eligibility criteria. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user must have a deceased spouse or civil partner whose death was caused by an insurance event (WorkAccident, CommutingAccident, or OccupationalDisease). Additionally, the user must have been in a valid marriage or civil partnership before the event.\n\nThe exclusion is if the marriage or partnership was formed after the insurance event and the death occurred within the first year of that union.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant properties are:\n- deceasedCivilPartner and deceasedSpouse for the deceased partner.\n- causeOfDeath to link the death to an event.\n- legalUnionBeforeEvent to check the relationship before the event.\n\nThe SHACL structure should target the User node. The main shape (ff:GUVWitwenrenteShape) will have OR conditions for deceasedCivilPartner or deceasedSpouse. Each must have a causeOfDeath that is an instance of the allowed event types. The event must also have legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nFor the exclusion, if the user formed the union after the event and the death was within the first year, they are ineligible. However, the ontology doesn't have a direct way to express the time since the marriage. The example uses legalUnionBeforeEvent to ensure the union existed prior to the event. If the event happened before the union, then the exclusion applies. Wait, the exclusion says if the union was after the event and death within first year. But SHACL can't directly check the date difference unless there's a data property like hasDate on the event and the marriage date. But according to the ontology, events have hasDate. \n\nWait, the ontology's Event class has a DataProperty hasDate (xsd:dateTime). So, perhaps the exclusion requires checking that the marriage date is after the event's hasDate and the death occurred within a year. But modeling exclusions in SHACL is tricky because SHACL is for validating that requirements are met. Exclusions are conditions that if true, the user is ineligible. So, the shape should include constraints that exclude cases where the marriage was after the event and death within a year.\n\nAlternatively, the example provided in the problem uses a qualifiedValueShape to enforce the legalUnionBeforeEvent. If the legalUnionBeforeEvent includes the user, that implies the union existed before the event. If the union was after, then the legalUnionBeforeEvent would not include the user, thus failing the constraint. But the exclusion says that even if they formed the union after, but death within first year, then no entitlement. Hmm, maybe the main constraint already covers the necessary conditions, and the exclusion is automatically handled by the constraints not being met?\n\nWait, the main requirement states that the user must have been in the union before the event. The exclusion adds that if the union was after the event AND the death was within the first year, then no entitlement. But the main condition already requires the union before the event, so the exclusion scenario would already fail the main condition. Therefore, maybe the exclusion doesn't need to be modeled separately because it's already covered by the main constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exclusion is an additional condition. For example, even if they were in the union before the event, but then formed a new union after the event and death within a year? Not sure. The problem states the exclusion is when the union was formed after the event AND death within first year. So the main constraints ensure that the user was in a union before the event. The exclusion scenario would not satisfy the main condition, so it's automatically excluded. Thus, maybe the exclusion doesn't need explicit handling beyond the main constraints.\n\nTherefore, the main SHACL shape should enforce that the deceased partner has a causeOfDeath event of the correct type, and that the user was in a legal union before the event.\n\nSo, structuring the SHACL:\n\n- The shape targets ff:User.\n- It uses sh:or for deceasedCivilPartner or deceasedSpouse.\n- Each of those must have a causeOfDeath that is one of the allowed event classes (WorkAccident, etc.), and the event must have legalUnionBeforeEvent including the user.\n\nIn Turtle, the example uses a NodeShape for the deceased partner (ff:DeceasedPartnerShape), which requires causeOfDeath to link to an event (ff:InsuranceEventShape). The InsuranceEventShape checks the event class and has the legalUnionBeforeEvent pointing to the user.\n\nThe exclusion condition might be automatically covered because if the marriage was after the event, then legalUnionBeforeEvent wouldn't include the user, so the shape's constraints would fail, thus the user is ineligible.

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this SHACL validation graph for the 'Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe' (Vocational Training Allowance). The user provided a detailed description of the requirements, and I need to translate that into SHACL constraints targeting the ff:User node. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each requirement and map them to the ontology terms. Let's start with the person eligibility criteria.\n\n1. **Living situation**: The user must not live with their parents during training if they are under 18, unmarried, and have no children. The ontology has ff:parentalAdress and ff:tooFarFromTrainingCompany. Also, checking age via ff:hasAge and marital status via ff:hasMaritalStatus. Need to structure OR conditions here.\n\n2. **Residence requirements**: Non-German nationals are eligible unless they have an Asylum Act permit (ff:hasAsylumActPermit) or are tolerated with less than 15 months (ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months). These are negated conditions.\n\n3. **Financial need**: They can't cover living costs, travel, family visits, work clothes, childcare. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit set to false.\n\n4. **First vocational training or not**: Check if it's the first (ff:isFirstVocationalTraining true) or, if not, that they can't be integrated otherwise (maybe via ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause a Disability that reduces work prospects permanently?).\n\n5. **Training must be recognized**: The training (ff:participates in) must be recognized by law (ff:recognizedByLaw being one of the legal codes like VocationalTrainingAct, CraftsCode, etc.). Also, ff:subjectToContract must be a VocationalTrainingContract.\n\n6. **Disability exceptions**: If the user has a disability (ff:hasDisability true), they can qualify even if living at home, provided certain conditions. This might involve checking for ff:hasDisability and related properties.\n\n7. **Training abroad conditions**: Partly abroad must not exceed 1 year (ff:monthsAbroad <=12?), or other conditions. The SHACL might need to check percentage or duration, but the ontology has ff:percentAbroad and ff:monthsTotal. Maybe use ff:monthsAbroad and ff:monthsTotal for the duration constraints.\n\n8. **Commissioned by Employment Agency**: For preparatory measures, ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency must be true.\n\nHmm, some parts are tricky. For instance, the financial need requires that they can't cover those specific costs. The ontology has ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit which seems to fit if that means covering basic needs including those costs. \n\nAlso, the 'recognized by law' part requires the training's ff:recognizedByLaw to be one of the listed laws (VocationalTrainingAct, CraftsCode, NursingProfessionsAct part 2, MaritimeLabourAct). So, the shape must check that the recognizedByLaw value is one of those individuals.\n\nFor the abroad conditions, if it's partly abroad, the monthsAbroad must be <=12 (since 1 year). The 'amtlich bestätigt' part might not be directly modelable since it's a third-party confirmation, so we skip that as per the rules.\n\nDisability exceptions: The user can live at home if they have a disability and meet other conditions. So, if the user has a disability, then the living condition (parental address too far) isn't required. This might need a SPARQL constraint or a conditional, but SHACL Core doesn't support conditionals. So perhaps separate shapes for disability cases? Alternatively, structure OR conditions.\n\nWait, the main shape should target ff:User and combine all constraints. Since SHACL Core can't do OR conditions easily, maybe use sh:or? Let me think.\n\nFor the living arrangement:\n\nEither:\n- Age >=18 (ff:hasAge >= 18)\n- Married (ff:hasMaritalStatus = Married or CivilUnion)\n- Has a child (ff:hasChild exists)\nOR\n- They have a disability and are in a situation allowing living at home (maybe the disability part allows it even if under 18, unmarried, no kids). But the requirement says \"can also get it if...\" so perhaps if they have a disability, the living condition is not required? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the user must satisfy either the living condition OR have a disability with certain other conditions. Since SHACL can't express this directly, perhaps split into two paths with sh:or.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe the initial approach is to list the main conditions and handle the disability as an exception via a different path.\n\nThis might take a while. Let's start building the SHACL step by step, ensuring each part is covered without violating the ontology terms.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_574724 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe\"@de, \"Vocational Training Allowance\"@en .\n\nff:Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:message \"User must be participating in a vocational training program.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:canCoverBasicNeedsOfBenefitUnit ;\n        sh:lessThan 1 ; # Must be false\n        sh:message \"User must not be able to cover basic needs and related costs.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n              sh:or (\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasAge ; sh:minInclusive \"18\"^^xsd:int ] ] \n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasMaritalStatus ; sh:hasValue ff:Married ] ]\n                [ sh:property [ sh:path ff:hasChild ; sh:minCount 1 ] ]\n              ) ]\n            [ sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"User must meet living arrangement criteria unless disabled.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasAsylumActPermit ;\n        sh:lessThan 1 ; # Must be false\n        sh:message \"User cannot have an Asylum Act permit.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:uninterruptedLegalStayForLessThan15Months ;\n        sh:lessThan 1 ; # Must be false\n        sh:message \"User must have stayed in Germany ≥15 months if tolerated.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:class ff:VocationalTraining ;\n        sh:message \"Training must be a vocational training program.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:recognizedByLaw ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:VocationalTrainingAct, ff:CraftsCode, ff:NursingProfessionsAct, ff:MaritimeLabourAct ;\n        sh:message \"Training must be recognized by applicable laws.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:subjectToContract ;\n        sh:class ff:VocationalTrainingContract ;\n        sh:message \"Must have a vocational training contract.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:commissionedByEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] \n            [ sh:hasValue \"false\"^^xsd:boolean ; \n              sh:property [ sh:path ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ; sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ] \n            ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Either commissioned by agency or first vocational training.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:monthsAbroad ;\n        sh:maxInclusive 12 ;\n        sh:message \"Training abroad must not exceed 1 year.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL validation graph for the social benefit \"Ausbildungsgeld\" with IDLB B100019_LB_574711 based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the user must have a disability (hasDisability true) and their rehabilitation provider must be the Federal Employment Agency (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency). So I'll need a shape that checks for these properties.\n\nNext, the user must be participating in one of the specified training measures. The options listed include first vocational training, vocational preparatory education including basic training, individual company qualification in supported employment, or the entry procedure and vocational training area in a workshop for disabled people or another provider. Looking at the ontology, \"EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea\" is a subclass of Training. For the first vocational training, there's the data property isFirstVocationalTraining. VocationalTraining is a subclass of Training. The other options might be covered by the Training class or specific subclasses. Since some of these are under Training, I can check if the user participates in a Training instance and that it's either the correct subclass or has the right properties. But maybe I should ensure that the training is of certain types. Wait, the exact classes might not all be explicitly listed, so perhaps using the participation in Training and checking for specific properties like isFirstVocationalTraining or being a subclass like EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea.\n\nThird condition: the user must not have a claim to transitional allowance. The transitional allowance is represented by ff:B100019_LB_102716305. So the user should not have a hasEligibilityFor that benefit. But looking at the ontology, there's ff:isEligibleFor and ff:isIneligibleFor. The user must not be eligible for the transitional allowance, so the shape should require that the user does not have isEligibleFor that benefit. Alternatively, maybe the user must not have a claim, so using sh:disjoint with that benefit.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL shapes. The target is always ff:User. \n\nFirst, create a NodeShape for the benefit. The targetNode is ff:User. \n\nCheck for hasDisability being true. Using sh:property with path ff:hasDisability, sh:hasValue true, and sh:minCount 1.\n\nThen, check the rehabilitation provider. The path is ff:hasRehabilitationProvider, and the value should be exactly ff:FederalEmploymentAgency. So sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\nNext, participation in the training. The user must have a participates property pointing to a Training instance. So sh:property with path ff:participates, sh:minCount 1. Additionally, the training must be one of the specified types. Since some are subclasses (like EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea) and others might be properties, perhaps using a SPARQL constraint here. Alternatively, check that the training is a subclass of Training and has certain properties. Alternatively, since the exact required types might not be all listed, maybe the condition is met if the participates object is of type Training and has certain properties like isFirstVocationalTraining true, but that might be too restrictive. Alternatively, the example uses a hasValue for a specific benefit, but here the training types are more varied. Maybe the best way is to use a SPARQL constraint to check that the participates is a Training instance and that it is one of the allowed types or has certain properties. But since SPARQL is not in SHACL Core, I need to use only SHACL Core components. So perhaps the simplest is to check that participates is present (minCount 1) and that the training is a Training instance. However, the problem states to model only clear requirements. Since the user must be in one of the listed training types, but those are not all explicitly covered in the ontology (like \"individuelle betriebliche Qualifizierung im Rahmen der Unterstützten Beschäftigung\"), maybe the best we can do is ensure that the participates is a Training instance and perhaps check for the entry procedure type. For example, if EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea is one of the options, then maybe require that participates is either that or another type. But without more info, perhaps just requiring participates in a Training is acceptable as per the ontology's definition. The user must participate in one of the listed measures which are all under Training or its subclasses. So the main check is that they participate in a Training instance. \n\nThird condition: no claim to transitional allowance. The user must not be eligible for ff:B100019_LB_102716305. So using sh:property for ff:isEligibleFor, sh:maxCount 0, sh:hasValue the transitional allowance benefit. Wait, no. Because if they are eligible for it, they shouldn't be. So the shape should require that the user does not have an isEligibleFor link to that benefit. So the constraint is sh:property with path ff:isEligibleFor, sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305, and sh:maxCount 0. That way, if they have that, it's invalid.\n\nPutting it all together, the shape will have three properties:\n\n1. hasDisability must be true.\n2. hasRehabilitationProvider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n3. participates in a Training (min 1).\n4. does not have isEligibleFor the transitional allowance.\n\nWait, but the third part requires that the training is one of the specific types. Since I can't check for subclasses or properties without SPARQL, maybe that's an ambiguous requirement and should be excluded. The problem states to not model ambiguous requirements. The user must be participating in one of the specified measures, but without exact ontology terms for all, perhaps that part can't be modeled. So the example might just check that participates is present, but the exact type isn't clear. Since the ontology has EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea as a subclass of Training, maybe that's one of the options. But the others like first vocational training might be covered by the isFirstVocationalTraining data property. So perhaps the training instance must have either that property set to true or be of the correct subclass. So maybe adding a nested constraint for the participates target to have either a subclass of EntryProcedureAndVocationalTrainingArea or have isFirstVocationalTraining true. But that requires SHACL-PATH or SHACL-SPARQL, which isn't allowed here. Since the user must be participating in one of those, but without clear ontology terms, maybe the requirement is too ambiguous and thus can't be modeled. Therefore, the only thing we can do is check that they participate in a Training instance, as per the ontology's definition. \n\nTherefore, the SHACL constraints would be:\n\n- hasDisability: true\n- hasRehabilitationProvider: FederalEmploymentAgency\n- participates in a Training (min 1)\n- not eligible for transitional allowance (B100019_LB_102716305)\n\nNow, writing the Turtle code. The shapes graph should have the social benefit as an individual first, then the NodeShape targeting User. The properties are as above.\n\nCheck the ontology for the exact identifiers. The benefit ID is B100019_LB_574711, so the benefit individual should be that. \n\nSo the SHACL code:\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training Allowance\"@en .\n\nff:Ausbildungsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;  # Ensure it's a Training instance\n        sh:message \"User is not participating in a required training measure.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;  # Transitional allowance\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for transitional allowance, which is not allowed.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but sh:class is not a valid SHACL Core component. Oops, SHACL Core uses sh:class to specify that the value must be an instance of a certain class. Wait, no, SHACL Core's sh:class is part of the core, yes. Let me confirm: SHACL Core includes sh:class. So that's okay. Alternatively, maybe the participates should have a sh:nodeKind sh:IRI, but since it's an object property pointing to Training, using sh:class is better.\n\nAlternatively, the participates property must have a value that is a Training instance. So the sh:class constraint on the property ensures that. \n\nSo this should cover all the conditions except the specific types of training, which might be too ambiguous. The problem states to not model ambiguous requirements, so we can proceed without that part.\n\nChecking the data properties and object properties again. For the first vocational training, the data property isFirstVocationalTraining is present. The user's participates must be a Training instance with that set to true. But since we can't check that without SPARQL or more constraints, perhaps it's better to leave it out as ambiguous. The requirement says \"first vocational training\", which might be represented by the isFirstVocationalTraining property. But how to enforce that? Maybe add another property constraint on the participates to have that property as true. However, that would require a nested shape, which might not be possible with SHACL Core's path expressions.\n\nAlternatively, using a SHACL Path to check the participates's isFirstVocationalTraining property. But SHACL Core allows for path expressions. Let's see:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path ff:participates / ff:isFirstVocationalTraining ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n]\n\nWait, but that would require that every participates has this property. But the user only needs to be in one of the listed training types. It's unclear if all the required trainings have that property. So perhaps this is too ambiguous and should be omitted. The problem states to only model clear requirements, so perhaps the training participation is sufficient with the Training class check.\n\nThus, the final SHACL should include the four constraints as above.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# Define the social benefit\nff:B100019_LB_574711 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Ausbildungsgeld\"@de, \"Training Allowance\"@en .\n\n# Validation shape for the benefit\nff:Ausbildungsgeld a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Must have a disability\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasDisability ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n        sh:message \"User does not have a disability.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider is not the Federal Employment Agency.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 3: Must participate in one of the specified training measures\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:participates ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:Training ;  # Must point to a Training instance\n        sh:message \"User is not participating in a required training measure.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 4: Must not have eligibility for transitional allowance\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:isEligibleFor ;\n        sh:maxCount 0 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:B100019_LB_102716305 ;  # Transitional allowance\n        sh:message \"User is eligible for transitional allowance, which is not allowed.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SHACL graph for the unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld) based on the given conditions. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the user must be unemployed. That means either not in an employment relationship or working less than 15 hours a week. Also, they must be available for placement by the employment agency. The SHACL needs to check these conditions.\n\nLooking at the ontology, unemployment status is represented by the EmploymentStatus individual ff:Unemployed. So the user's hasEmploymentStatus should be ff:Unemployed. Additionally, if they have an employment, the workHoursPerWeek must be less than 15. Wait, but if they are in employment, the inEmployment data property should be true, but also their hours must be under 15. Hmm, maybe using a SPARQL constraint here? But the examples used hasValue, so perhaps using path constraints with sh:lessThan.\n\nNext, the user must have registered as unemployed either electronically or in person. The ontology has a property like hasEmploymentStatus where the status is Unemployed, but maybe the registration is captured by being in the Unemployed status. Since the ontology might not have a specific property for registration method, perhaps this is implied by having the correct EmploymentStatus. I'll note that the EmploymentStatus must be Unemployed.\n\nThe third condition is the compulsory insurance period: at least 12 months within the last 30 months. The ontology has a data property ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 which is a boolean. So the user must have this set to true. That's straightforward with sh:hasValue true.\n\nNow, structuring the SHACL. The target is ff:User. The shape should check:\n\n1. EmploymentStatus is Unemployed. But also, if they have any employment, check hours. Wait, the condition says \"not in employment OR working less than 15 hours\". So either inEmployment is false, OR if true, then workHoursPerWeek < 15.\n\nWait, the ontology has ff:inEmployment as a data property (boolean) which is true if currently in employment. So maybe the path ff:hasEmploymentStatus should be equal to ff:Unemployed. Alternatively, using a SPARQL constraint for the OR condition. But SHACL Core doesn't support SPARQL, so maybe using sh:or with multiple constraints.\n\nAlternatively, the EmploymentStatus must be Unemployed (ff:Unemployed). Because the EmploymentStatus individual ff:Unemployed already includes the condition of being available for placement and working less than 15 hours. Let me check the ontology:\n\nLooking at the ontology, the EmploymentStatus individual ff:Unemployed has the comment: \"A person is available for the employment agency's placement efforts and not in employment or in employment for less than 15 hours per week.\" So the EmploymentStatus being Unemployed already encapsulates both parts of the first condition. So the first constraint can be that the user has hasEmploymentStatus equal to ff:Unemployed.\n\nSecond, the compulsory insurance condition is handled by the data property ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 being true.\n\nThird, registration is part of the EmploymentStatus, so maybe no additional constraint needed here unless there's a specific property for registration, but the ontology might not have it. The example didn't include registration steps as properties, so perhaps it's inferred by the EmploymentStatus.\n\nThus, the SHACL shape would have two properties:\n\n- hasEmploymentStatus must be ff:Unemployed\n- compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 must be true\n\nAdditionally, maybe check that the user is registered unemployed, but since that's part of the EmploymentStatus, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nSo writing the SHACL:\n\nThe target is ff:User. The shape would have:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed;\n  sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nand another property for the insurance:\n\nsh:property [\n  sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30;\n  sh:minCount 1;\n  sh:hasValue true;\n  sh:message \"...\";\n]\n\nWait, but ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 is a data property of type xsd:boolean, so yes, using hasValue true.\n\nSo putting it all together in Turtle.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_576842 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Arbeitslosengeld\"@de, \"Unemployment benefit\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:ArbeitslosengeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have employment status \"Unemployed\"\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue ff:Unemployed ;\n        sh:message \"User is not unemployed as required.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        # Must have compulsory insurance for at least 12 months in last 30\n        sh:path ff:compulsoryInsuranceFor12In30 ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Insufficient compulsory insurance period.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the social benefit \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\" with the IDLB B100019_LB_102717659 based on the given requirements. Let me start by understanding the requirements and mapping them to the ontology provided.\n\nFirst, the requirements are:\n\n1. The user has a severe visual or hearing impairment or is at risk of such a disability.\n2. The user's rehabilitation provider is the Federal Employment Agency.\n3. The user's prospects of participating in working life are significantly reduced not just temporarily due to the nature and severity of their disability, hence needing support for workforce integration.\n4. The user is willing to undergo vocational training or other integration measures.\n\nLooking at the ontology, the relevant properties and classes are:\n\n- For the first requirement:\n  - `hasDisabilityType` or `atRiskOfDisabilityType` should link to either `VisualImpairment` or `HearingImpairment`.\n  - The disability must be severe (`severeDisability` is true).\n  - The disability must permanently reduce work prospects (`reducesWorkProspectsPermanently` is true).\n\n- Second requirement:\n  - `hasRehabilitationProvider` must be `FederalEmploymentAgency`.\n\n- Third requirement:\n  - The disability must be the reason for reduced work prospects, so the user should be connected via `workforceIntegrationProblemBecause` to the disability.\n\n- Fourth requirement:\n  - The user must be willing, which might be represented by a data property like `availableForPlacement` being true? Wait, the example uses an inverse path for needing help, but the fourth point is about willingness. Maybe there's a data property for being available? Looking back, there's `availableForPlacement` which is \"able and willing to work\". That might fit here.\n\nWait, in the example given, the fourth requirement (\"bereit, sich bilden zu lassen\") was handled by an inverse path requiring the disability to point to the user via `workforceIntegrationProblemBecause`. But the fourth point here is about the user's willingness. The example didn't include that part perhaps because it was covered elsewhere? Let me check the example again. In the example provided, the fourth requirement was \"bereit, sich bilden...\" which in the SHACL was addressed via the inverse path. Wait, maybe the fourth point here is similar, but in the original example, maybe they used the inverse path to indicate the need for help. Alternatively, maybe the willingness is captured by another property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the willingness is implied by the other conditions, but the user must have a property indicating they are available for placement. The `availableForPlacement` data property is defined as \"able and willing to work subject to compulsory insurance under normal labor market conditions\". That seems to align with the fourth requirement. So maybe that needs to be included as a condition where `availableForPlacement` is true.\n\nLet me structure each requirement step by step.\n\nFirst requirement: User has severe visual or hearing impairment or at risk.\n\n- Using `sh:or` for `hasDisabilityType` or `atRiskOfDisabilityType`.\n- Each of these must have a disability of type VisualImpairment or HearingImpairment, and have `severeDisability` true and `reducesWorkProspectsPermanently` true.\n\nSo similar to the example's `DisabilityShape`, but for both the hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType.\n\nSecond requirement: Rehabilitation provider is FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n- A property shape on `hasRehabilitationProvider` must have `sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency)`.\n\nThird requirement: The disability's nature and severity cause the reduced prospects, hence needing help. This is already covered by the `reducesWorkProspectsPermanently` being true and the inverse path in the DisabilityShape connecting the user via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause.\n\nFourth requirement: User is willing (availableForPlacement is true).\n\n- So add a data property constraint on `availableForPlacement` with `sh:hasValue true`.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe main shape will target ff:User. The first requirement uses `sh:or` with qualified value shapes for each path (hasDisabilityType and atRiskOfDisabilityType). The DisabilityShape will have constraints on the disability's type, severity, and reducesWorkProspectsPermanently.\n\nAdditionally, the rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency, and the availableForPlacement must be true.\n\nWait, in the example, the inverse path was used to ensure that the user is the one needing help because of the disability. The example's DisabilityShape includes:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in ( ff:User ) ;\n] .\n\nThis ensures that the disability is the reason why the user needs workforce integration. So in this case, the same applies here. So that part is already included in the DisabilityShape.\n\nSo the final shape would look like:\n\nCreate a NodeShape for the benefit, with the four constraints:\n\n1. The OR condition on disability types (hasDisabilityType or atRiskOfDisabilityType) with the DisabilityShape.\n\n2. The rehabilitation provider must be FederalEmploymentAgency.\n\n3. The availableForPlacement must be true.\n\nWait, but in the example, the fourth point (being willing) was handled via the inverse path. Wait, no, in the example's requirements, the fourth was \"bereit, sich bilden...\" which was addressed by the inverse path, but perhaps that's a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the example given.\n\nThe example's fourth requirement was \"Sie sind bereit, sich beruflich bilden oder auf andere Weise beruflich eingliedern zu lassen.\" The SHACL for that included the inverse path requiring that the disability is the reason for needing workforce integration. So perhaps the willingness is captured by the fact that they need the help (because of the disability), and the availability is covered by the availableForPlacement property?\n\nWait, perhaps the fourth point here is similar. The user must be willing, which might be the same as being availableForPlacement. Alternatively, maybe the example's fourth point was not directly translated into a constraint, but in this case, the user must be willing, which is captured by availableForPlacement being true.\n\nSo adding the availableForPlacement constraint is necessary here.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should include all these elements.\n\nNow, translating this into Turtle:\n\nThe main shape would have:\n\n- The OR condition for disabilities.\n\n- The rehabilitation provider constraint.\n\n- The availableForPlacement constraint.\n\nAdditionally, the DisabilityShape enforces the disability's type, severity, and the inverse path.\n\nWait, but the example didn't include the availableForPlacement, but in the current problem's fourth requirement, it's explicitly mentioned. So that must be added.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL would look like this.\n\nCheck for any missing parts. Also, ensure that the target is ff:User, and all properties are from the ontology.\n\nAnother thing: The example used `sh:checksFundingRequirement` but that might be a custom property not in the ontology. Wait, in the example's SHACL, there's a line:\n\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_102717659 ;\n\nBut looking at the ontology, there's no mention of `checksFundingRequirement`. That might be a mistake in the example, but since the user's instruction says to use only SHACL Core components, perhaps that was an error. Since we must not invent terms outside the ontology, we should omit that line.\n\nTherefore, in the current answer, I should avoid using any such custom properties not in the ontology.\n\nSo, the shape would be:\n\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    # The OR condition for disability\n    sh:or (\n        [\n            sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape ;\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape ;\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    # Rehabilitation provider is FederalEmploymentAgency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:FederalEmploymentAgency ) ;\n    ] ;\n    # Available for placement (willingness)\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    # The DisabilityShape is defined elsewhere\n.\n\nThen the DisabilityShape:\n\nff:DisabilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment ) ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in ( ff:User ) ;\n    ] .\n\nWait, but the inverse path is to ensure that the user is linked via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause to the disability. So the DisabilityShape must have that as a constraint. \n\nPutting all together, the Turtle should look like that.\n\nI should also check if the example's DisabilityShape used the inverse path correctly. The example's DisabilityShape had:\n\nsh:property [\n    sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n    sh:minCount 1 ;\n    sh:in ( ff:User ) ;\n] .\n\nThis ensures that the disability is connected via workforceIntegrationProblemBecause to the user. So that's correct.\n\nNow, in the current problem's fourth requirement, which is about the user being willing, the availableForPlacement is set to true. That's added as a separate property constraint.\n\nTherefore, the final SHACL should include these parts.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_102717659 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Grundausbildung für Menschen mit Seh- oder Hörbehinderung\"@de, \"Basic training for people with visual or hearing impairments\"@en .\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\nff:GrundausbildungShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Severe visual/hearing impairment or at risk\n    sh:or (\n        [\n            sh:path ff:hasDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape ;\n        ]\n        [\n            sh:path ff:atRiskOfDisabilityType ;\n            sh:qualifiedMinCount 1 ;\n            sh:qualifiedValueShape ff:DisabilityShape ;\n        ]\n    ) ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Rehabilitation provider is Federal Employment Agency\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasRehabilitationProvider ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:FederalEmploymentAgency) ;\n        sh:message \"Rehabilitation provider must be Federal Employment Agency\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 4: Available for workforce integration\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:availableForPlacement ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n        sh:message \"Must be willing and able to participate in workforce integration\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# Helper shape for disability constraints\nff:DisabilityShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    # Must be visual or hearing impairment\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path rdf:type ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:VisualImpairment ff:HearingImpairment) ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Must be severe\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:severeDisability ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Permanently reduces work prospects\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:reducesWorkProspectsPermanently ;\n        sh:hasValue true ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Must be the reason for needing workforce integration\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path [ sh:inversePath ff:workforceIntegrationProblemBecause ] ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:User) ;\n    ] .\n```"

        "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a SHACL graph for the given eligibility requirements for the social benefit 'Insolvenzgeld' (Insolvency Allowance) with the IDLB B100019_LB_576848. Let me start by understanding the requirements step by step based on the provided text and the example.\n\nFirst, the user's task is to translate the German text into SHACL constraints targeting the node \"ff:User\". The example provided helps in understanding the structure and how to model similar conditions.\n\nLooking at the requirements:\n\n1. **Insolvency Event Occurred**: This has three possible scenarios:\n   - Opening of insolvency proceedings against the employer's assets (InsolvencyProceeding with isOpen true).\n   - Insolvency application rejected due to lack of assets (InsolvencyApplication with rejectedForLackOfAssets true).\n   - Discontinuation of business activity with obvious lack of assets (DiscontinuationOfBusiness and obviousLackOfAssets true).\n\n2. **Wage Not Paid for Up to 3 Months Before Event**: The user's wage was cut within 3 months before the insolvency event. This uses the wageCutOffsetMonths property, which must be between -3 and -1.\n\n3. **Employment Location**:\n   - Employed in Germany (countryOfEmployment is Germany).\n   - Or, employed abroad but still under German social security (countryOfEmployment not Germany, but socialSecurityCountry is Germany).\n\n4. **Employee Status**: The user must be legally recognized as an employee (hasEmploymentStatus in Employee).\n\nNow, I need to model these constraints using SHACL Core components. Let's break it down:\n\n**Target Node**: The shape must target ff:User.\n\n**1. Insolvency Event**:\n- The user's employer must have an event that is one of the three types (InsolvencyProceeding, InsolvencyApplication, DiscontinuationOfBusiness).\n- Each scenario (A, B, C) is modeled as a separate NodeShape under an sh:or condition.\n- For each scenario, the necessary properties (like isOpen, rejectedForLackOfAssets, etc.) must be included.\n\n**2. Wage Cut Condition**:\n- The wageCutShape from the example uses a PropertyShape with path to wageCutOffsetMonths and checks min/max inclusive values. I can reuse a similar structure here.\n\n**3. Employment Location**:\n- The user's employment must be in Germany or abroad but with social security in Germany. This is modeled as an sh:or between two NodeShapes (CountryShapeA and CountryShapeB).\n\n**4. Employee Status**:\n- A property shape ensuring hasEmploymentStatus includes ff:Employee.\n\nAdditionally, the example includes metadata for the SocialBenefit instance. The InsolvenzgeldShape will link to the benefit via ff:checksFundingRequirement.\n\nI should also ensure that all paths and properties are correctly mapped from the ontology. For example, 'countryOfEmployment' is an object property from Employment to Country, so the path is (ff:hasEmployment / ff:countryOfEmployment).\n\nCheck for any constraints that can't be modeled due to ambiguity. The text mentions needing to prove employee status via a specific procedure, but since it's a procedural requirement not directly assessable via data properties, it might be omitted as per the rules.\n\nPutting it all together, the SHACL shapes will structure each condition into shapes and use sh:or where alternatives exist. The example uses nested shapes effectively, so I'll follow that pattern.\n</think>\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix ff: <https://foerderfunke.org/default#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .\n\n# METADATA\nff:B100019_LB_576848 a ff:SocialBenefit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Insolvenzgeld\"@de, \"Insolvency allowance\"@en .\n\n# MAIN SHAPE\nff:InsolvenzgeldShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    ff:checksFundingRequirement ff:B100019_LB_576848 ;\n    sh:targetNode ff:User ;\n    \n    # Requirement 1: Insolvency event occurred at employer\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:employer ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:or (\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeA\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeB\n            ff:InsolvencyEventShapeC\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'An insolvency event occurred at the user's employer'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 2: Wage not paid for up to 3 months before event\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:triggeringEvent ) ;\n        sh:or (\n            [ sh:property ff:WageCutShape ]\n        ) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'Wage not paid for up to 3 months before insolvency event'.\"@en ;\n    ] ;\n    \n    # Requirement 3: Employment location condition\n    sh:or (\n        ff:CountryShapeA\n        ff:CountryShapeB\n    ) ;\n    \n    # Requirement 4: Must be legally recognized as employee\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:hasEmploymentStatus ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Employee) ;\n        sh:message \"Does not meet requirement 'User is legally recognized as employee'.\"@en ;\n    ] .\n\n# INSOLVENCY EVENT ALTERNATIVES\n\n# A) Insolvency proceedings opened\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyProceeding ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:isOpen ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\n# B) Insolvency application rejected for lack of assets\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:InsolvencyApplication ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ff:rejectedForLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\n# C) Business discontinued with obvious lack of assets\nff:InsolvencyEventShapeC a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEvent ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:class ff:DiscontinuationOfBusiness ;\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:employer ff:obviousLackOfAssets ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (true) ;\n    ] .\n\n# WAGE CUT CONDITION\nff:WageCutShape a sh:PropertyShape ;\n    sh:path ( ff:triggeringEvent ff:wageCutOffsetMonths ) ;\n    sh:minInclusive -3 ;\n    sh:maxInclusive -1 ;\n    sh:message \"Wage cut must have occurred between 1-3 months before the insolvency event\"@en .\n\n# EMPLOYMENT LOCATION CONDITIONS\n\n# A) Employed in Germany\nff:CountryShapeA a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n\n# B) Employed abroad with German social security\nff:CountryShapeB a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ( ff:hasEmployment ff:countryOfEmployment ) ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:not [\n            sh:in (ff:Germany)\n        ]\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path ff:socialSecurityCountry ;\n        sh:minCount 1 ;\n        sh:in (ff:Germany) ;\n    ] .\n```"
