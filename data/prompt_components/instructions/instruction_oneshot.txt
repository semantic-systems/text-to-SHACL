Your task is to generate a SHACL shapes graph based on the following inputs:
    - Context: An ontology that defines the properties, classes, and individuals to be used.
    - Input: The name and ID, called IDLB, of a social benefit and a text describing the conditions for eligibility for this benefit.

The shapes graph should encode the eligibility requirements described in the input text and target the node ff:user in order to validate whether the person that it represents qualifies for a given benefit.
Moreover the shapes graph must adhere to the following criteria:
    - Ontology Compliance: Constraints must apply only to terms defined in the ontology and respect the ontology's specifications, such as range, domain, and class hierarchy.
    - Output Format: Provide the SHACL shapes graph in Turtle syntax. The output must consist only of the final Turtle document.
    - Metadata: Use the name and IDLB to clearly identify the social benefit that the graph represents.
    - SHACL Core Only: Use only SHACL Core constraint components.

Use the example below to understand how to generate an SHACL shape for a given text.
